AB  - Anemia is a complication that affects a majority of individuals with advanced 
      CKD. Although relative deficiency of erythropoietin production is the major 
      driver of anemia in CKD, iron deficiency stands out among the mechanisms 
      contributing to the impaired erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced kidney 
      function. Iron deficiency plays a significant role in anemia in CKD. This may be 
      due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative 
      (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several 
      risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, 
      including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation. The 
      traditional biomarkers used for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in 
      patients with CKD have limitations, leading to persistent challenges in the 
      detection and monitoring of IDA in these patients. Here, we review the 
      pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD, we discuss the 
      literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of 
      IDA in CKD, and we summarize the available oral and intravenous (IV) iron 
      formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD. Two important issues are addressed, 
      including the potential risks of a more liberal approach to iron supplementation 
      as well as the potential risks and benefits of IV versus oral iron 
      supplementation in patients with CKD.

TI  - Iron Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 44-50
LID - 10.1159/000496492 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      CKD patients suffer from both absolute and functional iron deficiency. Absolute 
      iron deficiency is defined by severely reduced or absent iron stores, while 
      functional iron deficiency is defined by adequate iron stores but insufficient 
      iron availability for incorporation into erythroid precursors. This is due to 
      increased levels of hepcidin. Anemia in CKD is associated with an increased risk 
      of morbidity and mortality. The association between anemia and mortality may be 
      related to the severity of anemia. All CKD patients should be screened for anemia 
      during the initial evaluation for CKD. Criteria used to define iron deficiency 
      are different among CKD compared to normal renal function. Among CKD patients, 
      absolute iron deficiency is defined when the transferrin saturation (TSAT) is 
      ≤20% and the serum ferritin concentration is ≤100 ng/mL among predialysis and 
      peritoneal dialysis patients or ≤200 ng/mL among hemodialysis patients. 
      Functional iron deficiency, also known as iron-restricted erythropoiesis, is 
      characterized by TSAT ≤20% and elevated ferritin levels. Iron supplementation is 
      recommended for all CKD patients with anemia. There is general agreement 
      according to guidelines that intravenous (i.v.) iron supplementation is the 
      preferred method for CKD patients on dialysis (CKD stage 5D) and either i.v. or 
      oral iron is recommended for patients with CKD ND (CKD stages 3-5). In this 
      review we discuss the evidence base for these recommendations.

AB  - Iron deficiency commonly contributes to the anemia affecting individuals with 
      chronic kidney disease. This review describes diagnostic criteria for iron 
      deficiency in chronic kidney disease, as well as mechanisms of functional and 
      absolute iron deficiency and general treatment principles as delineated in the 
      KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline. Repletion of 
      absolute iron deficits has progressed over time with the addition of better 
      tolerated, more effective oral agents, including ferric citrate, ferric maltol, 
      and sucrosomial iron. This article examines the structural characteristics and 
      trial data enabling regulatory approval of these novel oral agents. Newer 
      intravenous iron therapies, including ferric carboxymaltose and ferric 
      derisomaltose, allow for fewer infusions and decreased risk of serious 
      hypersensitivity reactions. Concerns about adverse effects such as cardiovascular 
      events and infections are discussed. The potential risk of 6H syndrome (high 
      FGF-23, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, hypovitaminosis D, hypocalcemia, and 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism) due to these intravenous agents is emphasized. The 
      proposed pathophysiology of 6H syndrome and hypophosphatemia is described. Ferric 
      pyrophosphate citrate enables administration of iron for repletion through 
      dialysate. Relative merits, costs, and risks of various iron agents such as 
      hypersensitivity and 6H syndrome/hypophosphatemia are summarized.

TI  - Impact of Inflammation on Ferritin, Hepcidin and the Management of Iron 
      Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease.
LID - 10.3390/nu10091173 [doi]
LID - 1173
AB  - Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major problem in chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      causing increased mortality. Ferritin stores iron, representing iron status. 
      Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, thereby inhibiting iron absorption/efflux. 
      Inflammation in CKD increases ferritin and hepcidin independent of iron status, 
      which reduce iron availability. While intravenous iron therapy (IIT) is superior 
      to oral iron therapy (OIT) in CKD patients with inflammation, OIT is as effective 
      as IIT in those without. Inflammation reduces predictive values of ferritin and 
      hepcidin for iron status and responsiveness to iron therapy. Upper limit of 
      ferritin to predict iron overload is higher in CKD patients with inflammation 
      than in those without. However, magnetic resonance imaging studies show lower 
      cutoff levels of serum ferritin to predict iron overload in dialysis patients 
      with apparent inflammation than upper limit of ferritin proposed by international 
      guidelines. Compared to CKD patients with inflammation, optimal ferritin levels 
      for IDA are lower in those without, requiring reduced iron dose and leading to 
      decreased mortality. The management of IDA should differ between CKD patients 
      with and without inflammation and include minimization of inflammation. Further 
      studies are needed to determine the impact of inflammation on ferritin, hepcidin 
      and therapeutic strategy for IDA in CKD.

AB  - Iron is a key element for normal cellular function and plays a role in many 
      cellular processes including mitochondrial respiration. The role of iron 
      deficiency (ID) in heart failure (HF) has been a subject of debate amid 
      increasing advocacy for intravenous (IV) supplementation. Both the definition and 
      the approach to treatment of ID in HF have been adapted from the experience in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this review, we highlight the 
      differences in regulatory mechanisms as well as pathophysiology of ID in CKD and 
      HF population both at the systemic and cellular levels. We will review the major 
      clinical trials in HF patients that have shown symptomatic benefit from IV iron 
      supplementation but without effect on clinical outcomes. Intravenous iron loading 
      bypasses the mechanisms that tightly regulate iron uptake and can potentially 
      cause myocardial and endothelial damage by releasing reactive oxygen species. By 
      contrast, newer oral iron preparations do not have similar toxicity concerns and 
      might have a role in heart failure.

TI  - Abnormal Iron and Lipid Metabolism Mediated Ferroptosis in Kidney Diseases and 
      Its Therapeutic Potential.
LID - 10.3390/metabo12010058 [doi]
LID - 58
AB  - Ferroptosis is a newly identified form of regulated cell death driven by 
      iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Ferroptosis has 
      distinct biological and morphology characteristics, such as shrunken mitochondria 
      when compared to other known regulated cell deaths. The regulation of ferroptosis 
      includes different molecular mechanisms and multiple cellular metabolic pathways, 
      including glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4(GPX4) signaling pathways, which 
      are involved in the amino acid metabolism and the activation of GPX4; iron 
      metabolic signaling pathways, which are involved in the regulation of iron 
      import/export and the storage/release of intracellular iron through 
      iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs), and lipid metabolic signaling pathways, which 
      are involved in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes. 
      Ferroptosis plays an essential role in the pathology of various kidneys diseases, 
      including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), autosomal 
      dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
      Targeting ferroptosis with its inducers/initiators and inhibitors can modulate 
      the progression of kidney diseases in animal models. In this review, we discuss 
      the characteristics of ferroptosis and the ferroptosis-based mechanisms, 
      highlighting the potential role of the main ferroptosis-associated metabolic 
      pathways in the treatment and prevention of various kidney diseases.

AB  - To date, 3 clinical trials have shown symptomatic benefit from the use of 
      intravenous (IV) iron in patients with heart failure (HF) with low serum iron. 
      This has led to recommendations in support of the use of IV iron in this 
      population. However, the systemic and cellular mechanisms of iron homeostasis in 
      cardiomyocyte health and disease are distinct, complex, and poorly understood. 
      Iron metabolism in HF appears dysregulated, but it is still unclear whether the 
      changes are maladaptive and pathologic or compensatory and protective for the 
      cardiomyocytes. The serum markers of iron deficiency in HF do not accurately 
      reflect cellular and mitochondrial iron levels, and the current definition based 
      on the ferritin and transferrin saturation values is broad and inclusive of 
      patients who do not need IV iron. This is particularly relevant in view of the 
      potential risks that are associated with the use of IV iron. Reliable markers of 
      cellular iron status may differentiate subgroups of HF patients who would benefit 
      from cellular and mitochondrial iron chelation rather than IV iron.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside 1000/ferric derisomaltose versus iron 
      sucrose in patients with chronic kidney disease: the FERWON-NEPHRO randomized, 
      open-label, comparative trial.
PG  - 111-120
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfaa011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal intravenous (IV) iron would allow safe correction of iron 
      deficiency at a single infusion over a short time. The FERWON-NEPHRO trial 
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside 1000/ferric derisomaltose 
      (IIM) in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and iron 
      deficiency anaemia. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label and multi-centre 
      trial conducted in the USA, patients were randomized 2:1 to a single dose of 
      1000 mg IIM or iron sucrose (IS) administered as 200 mg IV injections up to five 
      times within a 2-week period. The co-primary endpoints were serious or severe 
      hypersensitivity reactions and change in haemoglobin (Hb) from baseline to Week 
      8. Secondary endpoints included incidence of composite cardiovascular adverse 
      events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 1538 patients were enrolled (mean estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 35.5 mL/min/1.73 m2). The co-primary safety objective 
      was met based on no significant difference in the incidence of serious or severe 
      hypersensitivity reactions in the IIM and IS groups [0.3% versus 0%; risk 
      difference: 0.29% (95% confidence interval: -0.19; 0.77; P > 0.05)]. Incidence of 
      composite cardiovascular AEs was significantly lower in the IIM versus IS group 
      (4.1% versus 6.9%; P = 0.025). Compared with IS, IIM led to a more pronounced 
      increase in Hb during the first 4 weeks (P ≤ 0.021), and change in Hb to Week 8 
      showed non-inferiority, confirming that the co-primary efficacy objective was 
      met. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with multiple doses of IS, a single dose of IIM 
      induced a non-inferior 8-week haematological response, comparably low rates of 
      hypersensitivity reactions, and a significantly lower incidence of composite 
      cardiovascular AEs.

TI  - FIND-CKD: a randomized trial of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral 
      iron in patients with chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anaemia.
PG  - 2075-84
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfu201 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal iron therapy regimen in patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. METHODS: 
      Ferinject® assessment in patients with Iron deficiency anaemia and 
      Non-Dialysis-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (FIND-CKD) was a 56-week, 
      open-label, multicentre, prospective and randomized study of 626 patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency not receiving 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients were randomized (1:1:2) to 
      intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting a higher (400-600 µg/L) 
      or lower (100-200 µg/L) ferritin or oral iron therapy. The primary end point was 
      time to initiation of other anaemia management (ESA, other iron therapy or blood 
      transfusion) or haemoglobin (Hb) trigger of two consecutive values <10 g/dL 
      during Weeks 8-52. RESULTS: The primary end point occurred in 36 patients 
      (23.5%), 49 patients (32.2%) and 98 patients (31.8%) in the high-ferritin FCM, 
      low-ferritin FCM and oral iron groups, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.65; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 0.44-0.95; P = 0.026 for high-ferritin FCM versus oral 
      iron]. The increase in Hb was greater with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (P 
      = 0.014) and a greater proportion of patients achieved an Hb increase ≥1 g/dL 
      with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (HR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.52-2.72; P < 0.001). 
      Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in all groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with oral iron, IV FCM targeting a ferritin of 400-600 µg/L 
      quickly reached and maintained Hb level, and delayed and/or reduced the need for 
      other anaemia management including ESAs. Within the limitations of this trial, no 
      renal toxicity was observed, with no difference in cardiovascular or infectious 
      events. CLINICALTRIALSGOV NUMBER: NCT00994318.

AB  - Global burden disease studies point out that one of the top cause-specific 
      anemias is iron deficiency (ID). Recent advances in knowledge of iron homeostasis 
      have shown that fragile patients are a new target population in which the 
      correction of ID might impact their morbidity, mortality and quality of life. We 
      did a systematic review using specific search strategy, carried out the review of 
      PubMed database, Cochrane Database of systemic reviews and international 
      guidelines on diagnosis and clinical management of ID from 2010 to 2016. The 
      International guidelines were limited to those with peer-review process and 
      published in journal present in citation index database. The eligible studies 
      show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early 
      decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The clinician 
      has to carefully consider fragile and high-risk subset of patients such as elders 
      or individuals with chronic diseases (i.e chronic kidney disease, inflammatory 
      bowel disease, chronic heart failure). Treatment is based on iron 
      supplementation. Infusion route should be preferentially considered in frail 
      patients especially in the view of new iron available formulations. The available 
      evidences indicate that (i) recurrent IDA should always be investigated, 
      considering uncommon causes; (ii) IDA might worse the performance and the 
      clinical outcome of fragile and high-risk patients and require an intensive 
      treatment.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Ferric Derisomaltose Compared to Iron Sucrose 
      for Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease With and 
      Without Heart Failure.

AB  - Ferric derisomaltose (FDI) is an intravenous (IV) high-dose iron formulation 
      approved in the US for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults who are 
      intolerant of/have had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron, or who have 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). FERWON-NEPHRO was a 
      randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the safety and 
      efficacy of a single infusion of FDI 1,000 mg versus up to 5 doses of iron 
      sucrose (IS) 200 mg (recommended cumulative dose, 1,000 mg) over 8 weeks in 
      patients with NDD-CKD and iron deficiency anemia. Of 1,525 patients included in 
      the safety analysis, 244 (16%) had a history of heart failure (HF). Overall, the 
      rate of serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions was low and did not differ 
      between treatment groups. Cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were reported for 
      9.4% of patients who had HF and 4.2% who did not. Time to first cardiovascular AE 
      was longer following administration of FDI compared with IS (hazard ratio: 0.59 
      [95% CI: 0.37, 0.92]; p=0.0185), a difference that was similar in patients with 
      or without HF (p=0.908 for interaction). Patients achieved a faster hematological 
      response (assessed by changes in hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations, and 
      increase in transferrin saturation) with FDI versus IS. In conclusion, in 
      patients with NDD-CKD, a single infusion of FDI was safe, well tolerated, and was 
      associated with fewer cardiovascular AEs and a faster hematological response, 
      compared to multiple doses of IS. These effects were similar for patients with 
      and without HF.

TI  - Role of Iron Deficiency in Heart Failure-Clinical and Treatment Approach: An 
      Overview.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13020304 [doi]
LID - 304
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of chronic heart failure (CHF) and iron deficiency 
      (ID) with or without anemia is frequently encountered in current medical practice 
      and has a negative prognostic impact, worsening patients' exercise capacity and 
      increasing hospitalization costs. Moreover, anemia is common in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CHF, an association known as cardio-renal anemia 
      syndrome (CRAS) possessing a significantly increased risk of death. AIM: This 
      review aims to provide an illustrative survey on the impact of ID in CHF 
      patients-based on physiopathological traits, clinical features, and the 
      correlation between functional and absolute ID with CHF-and the benefit of iron 
      supplementation in CHF. METHOD: We selected the most recent publications with 
      important scientific content covering the association of CHF and ID with or 
      without anemia. DISCUSSIONS: An intricate physiopathological interplay is 
      described in these patients-decrease in erythropoietin levels, activation of the 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, systemic inflammation, and increases in 
      hepcidin levels. These mechanisms amplify anemia, CHF, and CKD severity and 
      worsen patients' outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is frequently encountered in CHF 
      and represents a negative prognostic factor. Data from randomized controlled 
      trials have underlined the administration of intravenous iron therapy (ferric 
      carboxymaltose) as the only viable treatment option, with beneficial effects on 
      quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with ID and systolic heart 
      failure.

AB  - Anemia is a clinical feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Most common causes 
      are iron and erythropoietin deficiency. The last two decades have yielded 
      significant advances in understanding iron balance's physiology, including iron 
      trafficking and the crosstalk between iron, oxygen, and erythropoiesis. This 
      knowledge sheds new light on the regulation and disturbance of iron homeostasis 
      in CKD and holds the promise for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic tools 
      to improve the management of iron disorders. Hepcidin-ferroportin axis has a 
      central role in regulating body iron balance and coordinating communication 
      between tissues and cells that acquire, store, and utilize iron. Recent research 
      has revealed a bidirectional relationship between fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF23) and iron status, anemia, and inflammation, as well as the role of 
      erythroferrone (ERFE) in iron homeostasis. However, ERFE concentrations and 
      actions are not well-characterized in CKD patients. Studies on ERFE in CKD are 
      limited with slightly conflicting results. Despite general interest in iron 
      metabolism in kidney diseases, studies on the less prevalent renal replacement 
      therapy mode, such as peritoneal dialysis or hemodiafiltration, are scarce. 
      Slightly more was published on hemodialysis. There are several novel options on 
      the horizon; however, clinical data are limited. One should be aware of the 
      potential risks and benefits of the novel, sophisticated therapies. An inhibition 
      of hepcidin on the different pathways might be also a viable adjunctive 
      therapeutic option in other clinical situations.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have an extremely high risk of developing 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD) compared to the general population. Systemic 
      inflammation associated with oxidative stress could be an important determinant 
      of morbidity and mortality associated with CVD. We suspected that dysregulation 
      of iron metabolism should be considered in these patients. Anemia is prevalent in 
      CKD patients and is often treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) 
      and iron. In addition, iron administration sometimes causes iron overdose. 
      Excessive iron in the cytosol and mitochondria can accelerate the formation of a 
      highly toxic reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radicals, which damage lipids, 
      proteins, and DNA. In this review, we propose the following four major reasons 
      for oxidative stress in CKD patients: 1) iron is sequestered in cells by 
      proinflammatory cytokines and hepcidin; 2) the reduction in frataxin increases 
      "free" iron in mitochondria; 3) the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid, a heme 
      precursor, has toxic effects on iron and mitochondrial metabolism; and 4) the 
      elevated levels of the metabolic hormone, leptin, promote hepatic hepcidin 
      production. Although an efficient therapy for preventing oxidative stress in 
      these patients has not yet been well defined, we propose that ESAs for renal 
      anemia may ameliorate these causes of oxidative stress. Further clinical trials 
      are necessary to clarify the effectiveness of ESAs on oxidative stress in CKD 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and occurs due to diminished renal function. The main cause of such 
      anemia is decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production and secretion from the kidney 
      and a lower erythropoietic response to EPO. Treatment therefore involves 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Optimal erythropoietic response to ESA 
      therapy also requires adequate iron management. However, iron metabolism is also 
      dysregulated in CKD patients. SUMMARY: During erythropoiesis, biomarkers of iron 
      metabolism are dramatically altered by ESA therapy. Hepcidin 25 is a key hormone 
      of iron metabolism that regulates iron absorption from the gut and the release of 
      stored iron out of reticuloendothelial system cells. Recently, erythroferrone has 
      been identified as an erythroid suppressor of hepcidin 25 production. Because 
      erythroferrone levels are significantly increased by ESA treatment in CKD 
      patients, it may be a key factor in facilitating the release of stored iron into 
      the circulation during erythropoiesis in these patients. In this review, we 
      discuss the characteristics of the important biomarkers of iron metabolism in CKD 
      patients and the changes in these biomarkers after ESA administration. Key 
      Messages: In CKD patients, the management of anemia with ESA therapy requires 
      comprehensive assessment of the levels of various biomarkers, with consideration 
      of their optimal and physiological levels during erythropoiesis.

AB  - Intravenous iron therapy is increasingly being used worldwide to treat anemia in 
      chronic kidney disease and more recently iron deficiency in heart failure. 
      Promising results were obtained in randomized clinical trials in the latter, 
      showing symptomatic and functional capacity improvement with intravenous iron 
      therapy. Meanwhile, confirmation of clinical benefit in hard-endpoints such as 
      mortality and hospitalization is expected in large clinical trials that are 
      already taking place. In chronic kidney disease, concern about iron overload is 
      being substituted by claims of direct cardiovascular benefit of iron 
      supplementation, as suggested by preliminary studies in heart failure. We discuss 
      the pitfalls of present studies and gaps in knowledge, stressing the known 
      differences between iron metabolism in heart and renal failure. Systemic and 
      cellular iron handling and the role of hepcidin are reviewed, as well as the role 
      of iron in atherosclerosis, especially in view of its relevance to patients 
      undergoing dialysis. We summarize the evidence available concerning iron 
      overload, availability and toxicity in CKD, that should be taken into account 
      before embracing aggressive intravenous iron supplementation.

AB  - Iron deficiency is common in individuals with chronic kidney disease and plays a 
      major role in the development of anemia. Oral and intravenous iron agents are 
      both available to replete iron in patients with chronic kidney disease diagnosed 
      with iron deficiency. The choice of which agent to use is most often dictated by 
      goals of therapy, tolerability, convenience, and response to prior therapy. 
      Diminished absorption of iron in the gastrointestinal tract and a high incidence 
      of gastrointestinal adverse effects can reduce the efficacy of oral iron agents, 
      necessitating the use of i.v. iron formulations to treat iron deficiency anemia, 
      particularly in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy. Newer oral agents 
      may help to overcome these limitations and help treat iron deficiency in those 
      not requiring kidney replacement therapy. Recent studies have provided new 
      evidence that more aggressive repletion of iron in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease requiring kidney replacement therapy may provide benefits with respect to 
      anemia management and hard clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and 
      survival.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Iron deficiency is common and associated with adverse outcomes 
      in heart failure, regardless of anemia. Iron deficiency, absolute and functional, 
      with and without anemia, is associated with adverse outcomes in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Heart failure and CKD frequently occur together. Intravenous iron 
      therapy has been shown to reduce heart failure symptoms and improve physical 
      function in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with iron deficiency. In 
      CKD, intravenous or oral iron therapy are often used for management of anemia, 
      along with erythropoiesis stimulating agents, yet the risks and benefits of 
      intravenous iron use is controversial. In this review, we survey available 
      evidence and ongoing studies of iron deficiency and iron supplementation in heart 
      failure, and integrate with recent evidence on effectiveness and safety of 
      intravenous iron therapy in CKD. RECENT FINDINGS: Intravenous iron therapy 
      improves heart failure symptoms and physical function in heart failure with 
      reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency, regardless of anemia, and may 
      reduce heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Sustained 
      intravenous iron therapy regardless of hemoglobin level in selected patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis improves outcomes, and does not 
      appear to cause infectious complications. SUMMARY: Iron therapy has important 
      effects in heart failure and CKD, and appears safe in the short term. Ongoing 
      trials will provide additional important information.

TI  - Iron deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease: Uncertainties and cautions.
PG  - S78-S82
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12561 [doi]
AB  - Anemia in chronic kidney disease is common and iron deficiency is an important 
      cause. To repair iron-deficiency anemia, replacement of iron is needed. Iron can 
      be replaced either by the oral route or by the intravenous route. In a 
      meta-analysis, 5 of the 6 trials were short-term, 1 to 3 months, and compared to 
      oral iron, the mean increase in hemoglobin with intravenous iron was only 0.31 
      g/dL. However, one of the studies included in this meta-analysis was 6 months 
      long and had a mean decline in hemoglobin of 0.52 g/dL associated with 
      intravenous iron administration. Given the short duration of most of the clinical 
      trials comparing oral with intravenous administration of iron the long-term 
      safety of these modes of administration of supplemental iron could not be 
      assessed. Replacement of iron by the oral route is associated with mostly minor 
      complications such as black stools, constipation, and abdominal discomfort. In 
      contrast, intravenous administration of iron may lead to severe adverse events 
      such as anaphylaxis and, as a more recent randomized trial has suggested, delayed 
      complications such as infections and cardiovascular disease. Delayed 
      complications of repeated intravenous iron use are difficult to recognize at an 
      individual level therefore inpatients who have had recent cardiovascular events 
      or are infected, intravenous iron should probably be avoided. Balancing safety 
      and efficacy would require clinical judgment because 1 size may not fit all till 
      we have better data to support the liberal use of parenteral iron.

TI  - Biomarkers of iron metabolism in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 935-944
LID - 10.1007/s11255-020-02663-z [doi]
AB  - Iron is the most abundant transition metal in the human body and an essential 
      element required for growth and survival. Our understanding of the molecular 
      control of iron metabolism has increased dramatically over the past 20 years due 
      to the discovery of hepcidin, which regulates the uptake of dietary iron and its 
      mobilization from macrophages and hepatic stores. Anemia and iron deficiency are 
      common in chronic kidney disease. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic kidney 
      disease is multifactorial. Correction of anemia requires two main treatment 
      strategies: increased stimulation of erythropoiesis, and maintenance of an 
      adequate iron supply to the bone marrow. However, there are still many 
      uncertainties in regard to iron metabolism in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease and in renal replacement therapy. The aim of this review was to summarize 
      the current knowledge on iron metabolism in this population, including new 
      biomarkers of iron status. There is an area of uncertainty regarding diagnostic 
      utility of both erythroferrone (ERFE) and hepcidin in end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) patients. Higher concentration of hepcidin in oligoanuric patients may 
      reflect decreased renal clearance. Furthermore, the hepcidin-lowering effect of 
      ERFE in ESRD patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may 
      be blunted by underlying inflammation and concomitant iron treatment. Thus, 
      future studies should validate the use of ERFE as a biomarker of erythropoiesis 
      and predictor of response to iron and ESA therapy in dialysis-dependent patients.

AB  - To date, there is no consensus on the most reliable marker of iron status in

      beneficial to monitoring patients with CKD.

AB  - The hepatic iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin and its receptor, the cellular iron 
      exporter ferroportin, constitute a feedback-regulated mechanism that maintains 
      adequate plasma concentrations of iron-transferrin for erythropoiesis and other 
      functions, ensures sufficient iron stores, and avoids iron toxicity and 
      iron-dependent microbial pathogenesis. In chronic kidney disease, inflammation 
      and impaired renal clearance increase plasma hepcidin, inhibiting duodenal iron 
      absorption and sequestering iron in macrophages. These effects of hepcidin can 
      cause systemic iron deficiency, decreased availability of iron for 
      erythropoiesis, and resistance to endogenous and exogenous erythropoietin. 
      Together with impaired renal production of erythropoietin, hepcidin-mediated iron 
      restriction contributes to anemia of chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Dysregulated iron homeostasis plays a central role in the development of anemia 
      of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a major contributor toward resistance to 
      treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Understanding the underlying 
      pathophysiology requires an in-depth understanding of normal iron physiology and 
      regulation. Recent discoveries in the field of iron biology have greatly improved 
      our understanding of the hormonal regulation of iron trafficking in human beings 
      and how its alterations lead to the development of anemia of CKD. In addition, 
      emerging evidence has suggested that iron homeostasis interacts with bone and 
      mineral metabolism on multiple levels, opening up new avenues of investigation 
      into the genesis of disordered iron metabolism in CKD. Building on recent 
      advances in our understanding of normal iron physiology and abnormalities in iron 
      homeostasis in CKD, this review characterizes how anemia related to disordered 
      iron metabolism develops in the setting of CKD. In addition, this review explores 
      our emerging recognition of the connections between iron homeostasis and mineral 
      metabolism and their implications for the management of altered iron status and 
      anemia of CKD.

AB  - Anemia affects millions of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and prompt 
      iron supplementation can lead to reductions in the required dose of 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, thereby reducing medical costs. Oral and 
      intravenous (IV) traditional iron preparations are considered far from ideal, 
      primarily due to gastrointestinal intolerability and the potential risk of 
      infusion reactions, respectively. Fortunately, the emergence of novel iron 
      replacement therapies has engendered a paradigm shift in the treatment of iron 
      deficiency anemia in patients with CKD. For example, oral ferric citrate is an 
      efficacious and safe phosphate binder that increases iron stores to maintain 
      hemoglobin levels. Additional benefits include reductions in fibroblast growth 
      factor 23 levels and the activation of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. The 
      new-generation IV iron preparations ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside 1000, and 
      ferric carboxymaltose are characterized by a reduced risk of infusion reactions 
      and are clinically well tolerated as a rapid high-dose infusion. In patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis (HD), ferric pyrophosphate citrate (FPC) administered 
      through dialysate enables the replacement of ongoing uremic and HD-related iron 
      loss. FPC transports iron directly to transferrin, bypassing the 
      reticuloendothelial system and avoiding iron sequestration. Moreover, this paper 
      summarizes recent advancements of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 
      inhibitors and future perspectives in renal anemia management.

TI  - Iron therapy mitigates chronic kidney disease progression by regulating 
      intracellular iron status of kidney macrophages.
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.159235 [doi]
LID - e159235
AB  - Systemic iron metabolism is disrupted in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, 
      little is known about local kidney iron homeostasis and its role in kidney 
      fibrosis. Kidney-specific effects of iron therapy in CKD also remain elusive. 
      Here, we elucidate the role of macrophage iron status in kidney fibrosis and 
      demonstrate that it is a potential therapeutic target. In CKD, kidney macrophages 
      exhibited depletion of labile iron pool (LIP) and induction of transferrin 
      receptor 1, indicating intracellular iron deficiency. Low LIP in kidney 
      macrophages was associated with their defective antioxidant response and 
      proinflammatory polarization. Repletion of LIP in kidney macrophages through 
      knockout of ferritin heavy chain (Fth1) reduced oxidative stress and mitigated 
      fibrosis. Similar to Fth1 knockout, iron dextran therapy, through replenishing 
      macrophage LIP, reduced oxidative stress, decreased the production of 
      proinflammatory cytokines, and alleviated kidney fibrosis. Interestingly, iron 
      markedly decreased TGF-β expression and suppressed TGF-β-driven fibrotic response 
      of macrophages. Iron dextran therapy and FtH suppression had an additive 
      protective effect against fibrosis. Adoptive transfer of iron-loaded macrophages 
      alleviated kidney fibrosis, validating the protective effect of iron-replete 
      macrophages in CKD. Thus, targeting intracellular iron deficiency of kidney 
      macrophages in CKD can serve as a therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease 
      progression.

AB  - Anemia is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      mainly due to inadequate renal production of erythropoietin. In hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients this condition may be aggravated by iron deficiency (absolute or 
      functional). The correction of this anemia is usually achieved by treatment with 
      erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron (oral or intravenous). Studies 
      questioning the safety of ESAs (especially at higher doses) changed the pattern 
      of anemia treatment in CKD patients. According to the new guidelines, when 
      transferrin saturation is lower than 30% and ferritin lower than 500 ng/mL, a 
      trial with iron should be started, to avoid therapy with ESAs or at least to 
      reduce the doses needed to treat the anemia. Recent reports showed increasing 
      ferritin levels, towards values above 800 ng/mL, in CKD patients treated 
      according to the guidelines. In this review we focus on the risks of the 
      increased iron use to treat CKD anemia, namely, iron overload and toxicity, 
      increased risk of infections, as well as mortality.

AB  - For patients on dialysis, infection is the second leading cause of mortality. 
      Iron metabolism should be considered in the pathogenesis of infectious disease, 
      as high local iron concentrations favor the growth of many microbes. This review 
      is intended to provide information regarding iron metabolism and infection in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. There are 2 reasons these patients may be 
      vulnerable to infection: (1) the excessive iron administered to treat renal 
      anemia could be associated with impairments of the host's innate immune response, 
      (2) CKD-associated inflammation could cause dysregulated iron metabolism. 
      Pathogenic microorganisms can be categorized as extracellular or intracellular 
      pathogens. The proliferation site may determine the degree of virulence. In cases 
      of mainly extracellular microbial growth, the host's strategy of sequestering 
      iron in cells may efficiently inhibit proliferation. However, the same strategy 
      may favor the intracellular growth of microorganisms. The administration of 
      excessive amounts of iron may modify iron localization by an increase in the 
      hepcidin concentration. We conclude that there is a need for large multicenter 
      randomized controlled trials to evaluate the long-term safety of different iron 
      administration patterns that allow for a lower infection rate while still 
      producing efficient erythropoiesis in CKD patients.

TI  - Markers of iron status in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - S21-S27

AB  - Anemia is one of the main comorbidities related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      Until the advent of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA), endogenous 
      erythropoietin deficiency has been thought to be the main culprit of anemia in 
      CKD patients. The use of ESAs has shed new light on the physiology of CKD anemia, 
      where iron homeostasis plays an increasingly important role. Disorders of iron 
      homeostasis occurring in CKD turn the anemia management in those patients into a 
      complex multifactorial therapeutic task, where ESA and Iron dose must be properly 
      balanced to achieve the desired outcome without exposing the patients to the risk 
      of serious adverse events. This review covers diagnostic markers traditionally 
      used for quantifying iron status in CKD patients, such as serum ferritin and 
      transferrin saturation, new ones, such as reticulocyte hemoglobin content and 
      percent hypochromic red cells (HRC), as well as experimental ones, such as 
      hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). Each marker is presented in 
      terms of their diagnostic performance, followed by biological and analytical 
      variability data. Advantages and disadvantages of each marker are briefly 
      discussed. Although serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are easily 
      available, they exhibit large biological variability and require caution when 
      used for diagnosing iron status in CKD patients. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content 
      and the percentage of HRC are more powerful, but their widespread use is hampered 
      by the issue of sample stability in storage. sTfR and hepcidin show promise, but 
      require further investigation as well as the development of standardized, 
      low-cost assay platforms.

TI  - Iron therapy for managing anaemia in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 358-363
LID - 10.1097/MNH.0000000000000436 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Iron deficiency is a major contributory cause to the 
      development of anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and thus, iron 
      replacement therapy plays a critical role in the management of this condition. 
      The two main routes for administering iron are oral and intravenous, and there 
      have been a number of new publications relevant to both routes of administration. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Recent developments on the topic of iron management in CKD 
      include the introduction of new oral iron preparations, as well as two recent 
      meta-analyses on iron therapy in CKD (one on oral versus intravenous iron, and 
      one on high- versus low-dose intravenous iron in haemodialysis patients). There 
      is also increasing interest in other strategies to improve iron availability, 
      such as intradialytic iron, hypoxia-inducible factor stabilization and 
      antihepcidin strategies. SUMMARY: Even despite the latest publications in this 
      field, we are still left with serious gaps in our evidence base on how best to 
      provide supplemental iron to CKD patients. Most of the evidence suggests that 
      intravenous iron is superior to oral iron in increasing haemoglobin and 
      minimizing the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, but the safety of 
      intravenous iron remains a controversy. The PIVOTAL study will hopefully provide 
      informative data to fill some of the gap in the evidence-base and inform best 
      clinical practice.

AB  - Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and is associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. Patients with 
      CKD and IDA remain largely undertreated. Conventional oral iron agents are 
      insufficiently effective due to poor absorption and cause gastrointestinal side 
      effects; thus, novel oral iron preparations are needed. This article covers 
      current treatment guidelines for patients with anemia and CKD and clinical trial 
      data for iron-repletion agents currently in use, as well as for novel oral iron 
      therapies in development. Ferric citrate, a novel oral iron-repletion agent 
      approved for patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and IDA, demonstrated 
      improvements in hemoglobin levels and iron parameters, with good tolerability in 
      patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. When used as a phosphate binder, ferric 
      citrate also improves hemoglobin and iron parameters in dialysis-dependent CKD, 
      but additional trials are needed to evaluate its efficacy as an iron-repletion 
      agent in this setting. Other novel oral iron preparations in development for IDA 
      in patients with CKD include ferric maltol, which is approved in Europe and the 
      United States for IDA in adult patients, and sucrosomial iron, which has been 
      evaluated in IDA associated with CKD and several other clinical settings.

TI  - Intravenous iron therapy and the cardiovascular system: risks and benefits.
PG  - 1067-1076
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfaa212 [doi]
AB  - Anaemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this 
      setting, iron deficiency is frequent because of the combination of increased iron 
      needs to sustain erythropoiesis with increased iron losses. Over the years, 
      evidence has accumulated on the involvement of iron in influencing pulmonary 
      vascular resistance, endothelial function, atherosclerosis progression and 
      infection risk. For decades, iron therapy has been the mainstay of therapy for 
      renal anaemia together with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Despite its 
      long-standing use, grey areas still surround the use of iron therapy in CKD. In 
      particular, the right balance between either iron repletion with adequate therapy 
      and the avoidance of iron overload and its possible negative effects is still a 
      matter of debate. This is particularly true in patients having functional iron 
      deficiency. The recent Proactive IV Iron Therapy in Haemodialysis Patients trial 
      supports the use of intravenous (IV) iron therapy until a ferritin upper limit of 
      700 ng/mL is reached in haemodialysis patients on ESA therapy, with short 
      dialysis vintage and minimal signs of inflammation. IV iron therapy has also been 
      proven to be effective in the setting of heart failure (HF), where it improves 
      exercise capacity and quality of life and possibly reduces the risk of HF 
      hospitalizations and cardiovascular deaths. In this review we discuss the risks 
      of functional iron deficiency and the possible benefits and risks of iron therapy 
      for the cardiovascular system in the light of old and new evidence.

      fatigue, reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcomes. Treatment with 
      oral iron is often inadequate and international guidelines recommend intravenous 
      (i.v.) iron as the preferred option for the treatment of IDA in certain clinical 
      situations. In this review, we assess the safety of using i.v. iron with a 
      particular focus on patients with chronic kidney disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent 
      publications have raised safety concerns regarding the incidence of serious 
      reactions accompanying i.v. infusion, as well as the subsequent risk of 
      infections and cardiovascular events. Methodological flaws influence the 
      interpretation of these data that lack evidence from the use of modern irons. The 
      latter have been investigated in several randomized control trials. SUMMARY: 
      There is a need for better understanding and definition of the nature of i.v. 
      iron reactions, as many are nonserious infusion reactions rather than true 
      anaphylaxis. Retrospective identification of anaphylaxis is difficult and we 
      suggest the importance of reanalysing data using fatalities or standardized terms 
      as outcome measures. With the exception of high molecular weight iron dextran, 
      serious or life-threatening reactions are rare with the use of i.v. irons, and 
      they can be used safely for the treatment of IDA.

AB  - Current recommendations for the use of intravenous iron therapy in the management 
      of anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are based on limited 
      clinical evidence. Since the publication of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global 
      Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Anaemia in Chronic Kidney 
      Disease in 2012, a number of randomized clinical trials [notably, the Ferinject 
      Assessment in Patients with Iron Deficiency Anaemia (FIND-CKD) and Randomized 
      Trial to Evaluate IV and Oral Iron in Chronic Kidney Disease (REVOKE) trials] and 
      observational studies have been completed, and a further large clinical 
      trial-Proactive IV Iron Therapy in Dialysis Patients (PIVOTAL)-is currently 
      underway. In this article, the implications of the findings from these recent 
      studies are discussed and the critical evidence gaps that remain to be addressed 
      are highlighted.

AB  - Anemia is a common and clinically important consequence of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). It is most commonly a result of decreased erythropoietin production by the 
      kidneys and/or iron deficiency. Deciding on the appropriate treatment for anemia 
      associated with CKD with iron replacement and erythropoietic-stimulating agents 
      requires an ability to accurately diagnose iron-deficiency anemia. However, the 
      diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia in CKD patients is complicated by the 
      relatively poor predictive ability of easily obtained routine serum iron indices 
      (eg, ferritin and transferrin saturation) and more invasive gold standard 
      measures of iron deficiency (eg, bone marrow iron stores) or erythropoietic 
      response to supplemental iron. In this review, we discuss the diagnostic utility 
      of currently used serum iron indices and emerging alternative markers of iron 
      stores.

AB  - Anemia is a common complication and its impact on morbimortality in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well known. The discovery of hepcidin and its 
      functions has contributed to a better understanding of iron metabolism disorders 
      in CKD anemia. Hepcidin is a peptide mainly produced by hepatocytes and, through 
      a connection with ferroportin, it regulates iron absorption in the duodenum and 
      its release of stock cells. High hepcidin concentrations described in patients 
      with CKD, especially in more advanced stages are attributed to decreased renal 
      excretion and increased production. The elevation of hepcidin has been associated 
      with infection, inflammation, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and oxidative 
      stress. Some strategies were tested to reduce the effects of hepcidin in patients 
      with CKD, however more studies are necessary to assess the impact of its 
      modulation in the management of anemia in this population. Resumo Anemia é uma 
      complicação frequente e seu impacto na morbimortalidade é bem conhecido em 
      pacientes com doença renal crônica (DRC). A descoberta da hepcidina e de suas 
      funções contribuíram para melhor compreensão dos distúrbios do metabolismo de 
      ferro na anemia da DRC. Hepcidina é um peptídeo produzido principalmente pelos 
      hepatócitos, e através de sua ligação com a ferroportina, regula a absorção de 
      ferro no duodeno e sua liberação das células de estoque. Altas concentrações de 
      hepcidina descritas em pacientes com DRC, principalmente em estádios mais 
      avançados, são atribuídas à diminuição da excreção renal e ao aumento de sua 
      produção. Elevação de hepcidina tem sido associada à ocorrência de infecção, 
      inflamação, aterosclerose, resistência à insulina e estresse oxidativo. Algumas 
      estratégias foram testadas para diminuir os efeitos da hepcidina em pacientes com 
      DRC, entretanto, serão necessários mais estudos para avaliar o impacto de sua 
      modulação no manejo da anemia nessa população.

TI  - Iron dosing in kidney disease: inconsistency of evidence and clinical practice.
PG  - 187-96
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfu104 [doi]
AB  - The management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
      difficult. The availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has 
      increased treatment options for previously transfusion-requiring patients, but 
      the recent evidence of ESA side effects has prompted the search for complementary 
      or alternative approaches. Next to ESA, parenteral iron supplementation is the 
      second main form of anemia treatment. However, as of now, no systematic approach 
      has been proposed to balance the concurrent administration of both agents 
      according to individual patient's needs. Furthermore, the potential risks of 
      excessive iron dosing remain a topic of controversy. How, when and whether to 
      monitor CKD patients for potential iron overload remain to be elucidated. This 
      review addresses the question of risk and benefit of iron administration in CKD, 
      highlights the evidence supporting current practice, provides an overview of 
      standard and potential new markers of iron status and outlines a new 
      pharmacometric approach to physiologically compatible individualized dosing of 
      ESA and iron in CKD patients.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a tremendously higher risk of 
      developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and infection than the non-CKD 
      population, which could be caused by intertwining actions of hyperphosphatemia 
      and CKD associated misdistribution of iron. CVD is often associated with vascular 
      calcification, which has been attributed to hyperphosphatemia, and could be 
      initiated in mitochondria, inducing apoptosis, and accelerated by reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS). The production of ROS is principally linked to intracellular 
      ferrous iron. For infection, the virulence and pathogenicity of a pathogen is 
      directly related to its capacity to acquire iron for proliferation and to escape 
      or subvert the host's immune response. Iron administration for renal anemia can 
      sometimes be overdosed, which could decrease host immune mechanisms through its 
      direct effect on neutrophils, macrophages and T cell function. Hyperphosphatemia 
      has been demonstrated to be associated with an increased incidence of infection. 
      We hypothesized two possible mechanisms: 1) fibroblast growth factor-23 levels 
      are increased in parallel with serum phosphate levels and directly impair 
      leukocyte recruitment and host defense mechanisms, and 2) circulating 
      non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) is increased due to decreased iron binding 
      capacity of the carrier protein transferrin in high-phosphate conditions. From 
      these observations, maintaining an adequate serum range of phosphate levels and 
      minimizing intracellular iron accumulation could attenuate the development of CKD 
      complications.

TI  - Oral iron supplementation in patients with chronic kidney disease: Can it be 
      harmful to the gut microbiota?
PG  - 81-93
LID - 10.1002/ncp.10662 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have several pathophysiological 
      alterations, including anemia, one of the first changes in CKD patients. More 
      recently, researchers have observed that the intestinal microbiota alterations 
      are also another complication in these patients. The most common treatment for 
      anemia is oral (mainly ferrous sulfate) or intravenous iron supplementation. 
      Despite being a necessary treatment, recent studies have reported that 
      supplementation with oral iron may increase its availability in the intestine, 
      leading to disturbance in the gut microbiota and also to oxidative stress in the 
      enterocytes, which may change the permeability and the microbiota profile. 
      Although it is a therapy routinely used in patients with CKD, supplementation 
      with oral iron on the gut microbiota has been rarely studied in these patients. 
      Thus, this review will discuss the relationship between iron and the gut 
      microbiota and the possible effects of oral iron supplementation on gut 
      microbiota in patients with CKD.

TI  - Iron Deficiency in CKD Without Concomitant Anemia.
PG  - 2752-2762
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2021.07.032 [doi]
AB  - The physiological role of iron extends well beyond hematopoiesis. Likewise, the 
      pathophysiological effects of iron deficiency (ID) extend beyond anemia. Although 
      inextricably interrelated, ID and anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are 
      distinct clinical entities. For more than 3 decades, however, nephrologists have 
      focused primarily on the correction of anemia. The achievement of target 
      hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations is prioritized over repletion of iron stores, and 
      iron status is generally a secondary consideration only assessed in those 
      patients with anemia. Historically, the correction of ID independent of anemia 
      has not been a primary focus in the management of CKD. In contrast, ID is a key 
      therapeutic target in the setting of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection 
      fraction (HFrEF); correction of ID in this population improves functional status 
      and quality of life and may improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Given the 
      strong interrelationships between HF and CKD, it is reasonable to consider 
      whether iron therapy alone may benefit those with CKD and evidence of ID 
      irrespective of Hgb concentration. In this review, we differentiate anemia from 
      ID by considering both epidemiologic and pathophysiological perspectives and by 
      reviewing the evidence linking correction of ID to outcomes in patients with HF 
      and/or CKD. Furthermore, we discuss existing gaps in evidence and provide 
      proposals for future research and practical considerations for clinicians.

TI  - Iron Parameters in Patients Treated with Roxadustat for Anemia of Chronic Kidney 
      Disease.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12134217 [doi]
LID - 4217
AB  - Roxadustat is a novel agent with a distinct mechanism of action compared to 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and a potentially different combination 
      of effects on iron parameters. This narrative review describes the effects of 
      roxadustat on iron parameters and on hemoglobin levels in the context of iron 
      supplementation in patients with anemia of non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) or 
      dialysis-dependent (DD) chronic kidney disease (CKD). Roxadustat use was 
      associated with a greater reduction in serum ferritin levels than seen with ESAs 
      and an increase in serum iron levels compared to a decrease with ESAs. Decreases 
      in transferrin saturation in patients treated with roxadustat were relatively 
      small and, in the case of patients with NDD CKD, not observed by Week 52. These 
      changes reflect the concomitant increases in both serum iron and total 
      iron-binding capacity. Compared to placebo and an ESA, roxadustat improved iron 
      availability and increased erythropoiesis while requiring less intravenous iron 
      use. Hepcidin levels generally decreased in patients who received roxadustat 
      compared to baseline values in all CKD populations; these decreases appear to be 
      more robust with roxadustat than with an ESA or placebo. The mechanisms behind 
      the effects of roxadustat and ESAs on iron availability and stores and 
      erythropoiesis appear to differ and should be considered holistically when 
      treating anemia of CKD.

TI  - Iron metabolism and management: focus on chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 46-58
LID - 10.1016/j.kisu.2020.12.003 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and results from 
      the dysregulation of iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. Hepcidin is a key 
      regulator of iron availability and leads to iron sequestration during the state 
      of iron repletion. Decreases in the level of hepcidin in the presence of hypoxia 
      and/or iron limitation allow for greater iron availability for erythropoiesis. 
      However, kidney excretion of hepcidin decreases as the severity of CKD increases, 
      whereas production of hepcidin is increased under inflammatory conditions often 
      present in patients with CKD, both of which contribute to anemia. Assessment of 
      iron status is, therefore, essential in the treatment of anemia. However, current 
      laboratory tests for the determination of the adequate supply of iron have many 
      limitations, including diurnal variation in the levels of biomarkers, lack of 
      standardized reference methods across laboratories, and confounding by the 
      presence of inflammation. In addition, the current treatment paradigm for anemia 
      of CKD can further disrupt iron homeostasis; for example, treatment with 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the absence of supplemental iron can induce 
      functional iron deficiency. Moreover, supplemental iron can further increase 
      levels of hepcidin. Several novel therapies, including hypoxia-inducible factor 
      prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors and hepcidin inhibitors/antagonists, have shown 
      promise in attenuating the levels and/or activity of hepcidin in anemia of CKD, 
      thus ensuring the availability of iron for erythropoiesis.

TI  - NOVEL IRON BIOMARKERS IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE.
PG  - 3230-3233
AB  - CKD is one of the fastest growing causes of death in the world and in 2040, it is 
      estimated that it will be in the top five causes of death. In order to slow down 
      this process, it is necessary to improve prevention, inhibit development and 
      treat complications including anemia. Anemia is one of the common complication of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a significant clinical problem. It is most 
      often the result of decreased renal production of erythropoietin and / or iron 
      deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common problems in CKD that 
      increases mortality. In order to successfully treat anemia in CKD with 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agentsand (ESA) and iron substitution, it is necessary 
      to determine iron iron level. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in patients 
      with CKD is complicated due to the relatively low predictive ability of routine 
      serum iron markers (e.g., ferritin and transferrin saturation) and more invasive 
      measurements such as bone marrow iron stores. In the review novel biomarkers of 
      iron metabolism are discussed such as hypoxia-inducible factor, erythroferon, 
      growth differentiation factor 15 etc. with their possible clinical relevance.

TI  - Use of intravenous iron supplementation in chronic kidney disease: an update.
PG  - 9-22
AB  - Iron deficiency is an important clinical concern in chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      giving rise to iron-deficiency anemia and impaired cellular function. Oral 
      supplementation, in particular with ferrous salts, is associated with a high rate 
      of gastrointestinal side effects and is poorly absorbed, a problem that is 
      avoided with intravenous iron. The most stable intravenous iron complexes (eg, 
      iron dextran, ferric carboxymaltose, ferumoxytol, and iron isomaltoside 1000) can 
      be given in higher single doses and more rapidly than less stable preparations 
      (eg, sodium ferric gluconate). Iron complexes that contain dextran or 
      dextran-derived ligands can cause dextran-induced anaphylactic reactions, which 
      cannot occur with dextran-free preparations such as ferric carboxymaltose and 
      iron sucrose. Test doses are advisable for conventional dextran-containing 
      compounds. Iron supplementation is recommended for all CKD patients with anemia 
      who receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, whether or not they require 
      dialysis. Intravenous iron is the preferred route of administration in 
      hemodialysis patients, with randomized trials showing a significantly greater 
      increase in hemoglobin levels for intravenous versus oral iron and a low rate of 
      treatment-related adverse events. In the nondialysis CKD population, the 
      erythropoietic response is also significantly higher using intravenous versus 
      oral iron, and tolerability is at least as good. Moreover, in some nondialysis 
      patients intravenous iron supplementation can avoid, or at least delay, the need 
      for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In conclusion, we now have the ability to 
      achieve iron replenishment rapidly and conveniently in dialysis-dependent and 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD patients without compromising safety.

AB  - Introduction: Iron-deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common 
      and has prognostic, financial, and quality of life implications. Intravenous (IV) 
      iron is a key intervention for optimal management, however, ongoing safety 
      concerns exist. Area covered: The potential side effects associated with IV iron 
      use are addressed as we review the most recent studies. Hypersensitivity 
      reactions and true anaphylaxis are indeed rare with a greater understanding of 
      the nature of labile iron and 'Fishbane' reactions. Hypophosphatemia appears 
      commoner with certain IV iron preparations, however its significance in CKD 
      requires exploration. The long-standing questions regarding oxidative stress and 
      the potential susceptibility to infections and worsening cardiovascular morbidity 
      are discussed. Iron overload secondary to repeat IV iron infusions is plausible, 
      however, a number of guidelines limit and strictly guide prescription. Expert 
      opinion: The past decade has improved our understanding of IV iron administration 
      safety in patients with CKD. Third generation IV iron compounds have minimized 
      hypersensitivity reactions while allowing high doses to be administered safely 
      and rapidly in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients. However, differences in 
      safety profiles such as hypophosphatemia require further study and therapy should 
      be tailored to the individual. Clinicians should feel confident in using IV iron 
      therapy.

TI  - The emerging role of iron in heart failure and vascular calcification in CKD.
PG  - 739-745
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfaa135 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency is a frequent comorbidity of cardiovascular (CV) diseases and 
      nearly 50% of patients with heart failure (HF) with or without anaemia have low 
      levels of available iron. There is a strong association between anaemia and the 
      increase in mortality and hospitalizations in patients with CV disease and HF. 
      Moreover, anaemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD) often coexist in patients with 
      HF, with anaemia increasing the risk of death in these subjects and with a 
      further increased risk in CKD population. The evidence that the treatment of iron 
      deficiency and the increase in haemoglobin are associated with a better prognosis 
      in HF patients has elicited new interest in the utilization of iron in HF and CKD 
      patients. One of the central players in CV disease is vascular calcification 
      (VC), which has been recognized as a major independent risk factor for incident 
      CV disease and overall mortality in chronic disease patients. In this review, we 
      summarize the evidences generated by clinical trials aimed to study the effect of 
      iron deficiency correction, the effect of iron-based phosphate binder in in vivo 
      models of kidney failure and the effect of iron in in vitro models of VC, trying 
      to give an overview of the present knowledge on iron effect and its mechanisms of 
      action.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA) has been shown to be the most common 
      cause of anaemia worldwide. It is accepted that people with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) develop anaemia as their kidney function declines. METHODS: To 
      better understand IDA in CKD, it is necessary to appreciate the normal iron 
      metabolism and utilisation of iron and how these processes can be disordered in 
      patients with CKD. The problems related to infection / inflammation and oxidative 
      stress are examined. Whilst National and international guidelines recommend 
      specific tests for IDA, these and alternative tests are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Whilst iron supplementation is necessary for CKD patients with IDA, iron 
      metabolism and utilisation can be affected by factors such as infection or 
      inflammation. Iron is essential element for all life, it can be toxic to cells 
      through the process of oxidative stress. The recommended tests for IDA may be 
      affected by factors such as infection and inflammation. Alternative tests are 
      available, which may be a more accurate indicator of IDA as they are not affected 
      by external factors.

TI  - Novel iron-containing phosphate binders and anemia treatment in CKD: oral iron 
      intake revisited.
PG  - 1588-94
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv268 [doi]
AB  - Recent reports have shown that novel phosphate binders containing iron are not 
      only efficacious for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia but also may reduce the 
      need for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and intravenous (IV) iron for anemia 
      management in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Possible healthcare 
      cost savings, which have not been demonstrated in a long-term study, may be an 
      additional advantage of using such multi-pronged treatment strategies for the 
      control of both hyperphosphatemia and iron needs. It is currently assumed that 
      oral iron supplementation is less efficient than the IV route in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). The unexpected efficacy of novel iron-containing 
      phosphate binders, such as ferric citrate, in repleting insufficient iron stores 
      and improving the anemia of CKD could change this view. Previous assumptions of 
      self-controlled iron uptake by 'mucosal block' or hepcidin, or else by impaired 
      intestinal iron absorption due to CKD-associated inflammation cannot be 
      reconciled with recent observations of the effects of ferric citrate 
      administration. Citrate in the intestinal lumen may partly contribute to the 
      acceleration of iron absorption. Animal experiments and clinical studies have 
      also shown that oral iron overload can cause excessive iron accumulation despite 
      high hepcidin levels, which are not able to block iron absorption completely. 
      However, like with IV iron agents, no long-term safety data exist with respect to 
      the effects of iron-containing phosphate binders on 'hard' patient outcomes. 
      Future randomized prospective studies in patients with CKD are necessary to 
      establish the safety of oral iron-containing phosphate binders for the control of 
      both hyperphosphatemia and renal anemia.

PG  - 2013-22

AB  - Ferumoxytol is an intravenously administered iron preparation indicated in the EU 
      and the US for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in adult patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). It consists of superparamagnetic iron oxide 
      nanoparticles coated with a semi-synthetic carbohydrate shell in an isotonic, 
      neutral pH solution that can be administered at relatively high dose by rapid 
      intravenous injection. In phase III, randomized, controlled trials, two doses of 
      ferumoxytol (510 mg iron/dose) given 2-8 days apart increased mean haemoglobin 
      levels from baseline to week 5 significantly more than oral iron (200 mg/day for 
      21 days) in adult patients with iron deficiency anaemia and CKD stages 1-5. 
      Ferumoxytol was more effective than oral iron both in patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent CKD and in those with haemodialysis-dependent CKD. 
      Ferumoxytol was generally well tolerated in randomized controlled clinical 
      trials. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity; serious 
      hypersensitivity or hypotensive reactions were uncommon. Local injection-site 
      reactions were the most common system/organ-class adverse events in a pooled 
      analysis of clinical studies and post-marketing experience.

TI  - The problem with transferrin saturation as an indicator of iron 'sufficiency' in 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1377-1383
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfaa048 [doi]
AB  - After a brief review of physiological iron metabolism, we describe diagnostic 
      tests for iron status and iron deficiency anemia in patients without chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) or inflammation. Thereafter we review the dysregulation of 
      iron metabolism in CKD. Specific emphasis is placed on the role of the 
      'inflammatory' state that develops with the progression of CKD. It invokes 
      changes in iron metabolism that are the exact opposite of those occurring during 
      pure iron deficiency. As a result, transferrin saturation (TSAT) becomes a poorer 
      index of iron availability to the bone marrow and serum ferritin no longer 
      represents iron that can be used during erythropoiesis. We argue that serum iron 
      may provide more information to guide iron therapy than TSAT. In other words, the 
      emphasis on TSAT is misplaced. With the development of a number of 
      hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which restore iron 
      metabolism toward the 'physiologic state', the iron indices indicating sufficient 
      iron availability to avoid functional iron deficiency during therapy of 
      CKD-associated anemia are likely to change. We summarize these changes in the 
      section 'A peek into things to come!', citing the available data.

AB  - Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated 
      with increased mortality and reduced health-related quality of life. Anemia is 
      characterized by a decrease in hemoglobin, the iron-rich protein that the body 
      uses for oxygen transport. Iron is required to produce hemoglobin, and 
      disruptions in the iron homeostasis can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. 
      Management of anemia in individuals with CKD is typically performed by a team of 
      physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or registered nurses. 
      Throughout the care continuum, the management can be enhanced by 
      multidisciplinary care, and individuals with CKD can benefit from the involvement 
      of other specialties, with dietitians/nutritionists playing an important role. 
      However, a key area of unmet clinical need is how to assess and address 
      iron-deficiency anemia. This review aims to provide an overview of 
      iron-deficiency anemia in CKD and how this may be diagnosed and managed by the 
      entire kidney care team, such as describing the mechanisms underlying iron 
      homeostasis, the complications of iron-deficiency anemia, and the current 
      challenges associated with its diagnosis and treatment in CKD. Opportunities for 
      each multidisciplinary team member to add value to the care of individuals with 
      CKD and iron-deficiency anemia are also described.

TI  - Iron supplementation in the non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patient: 
      oral or intravenous?
PG  - 473-82
LID - 10.1185/03007990903512461 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of iron-deficiency anaemia in patients with 
      non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) remains controversial, particularly 
      regarding the use of oral versus intravenous iron supplementation. METHODS: A 
      PubMed search from 1970 to February 2009 was conducted to identify relevant 
      research articles. FINDINGS: Iron supplementation is advisable for all 
      iron-deficient CKD patients receiving erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), 
      and intravenous iron may be preferable to oral iron. However, there is also a 
      growing body of data indicating that iron supplementation may avoid or delay the 
      need for ESA therapy in some ND-CKD patients. In each of four randomised trials 
      that included ND-CKD patients without ESA, the haemoglobin response was greater 
      with i.v. versus oral iron. Moreover, some ND-CKD patients who remain anaemic on 
      oral iron may subsequently respond to i.v. iron. Newer preparations (ferric 
      carboxymaltose and ferumoxytol) permit rapid, high-dose administration. In a 
      randomised study, a single 15-minute injection of ferric carboxymaltose, with up 
      to two additional doses as required, resulted in 53.2% of ND-CKD patients 
      achieving > or =1 g/dL increase in haemoglobin by day 56 without ESA, compared to 
      29.9% of patients given oral iron supplements. Two large, randomised, ongoing 
      trials will address the important question of whether i.v. or oral iron 
      supplementation affects the progression of renal dysfunction. While i.v. iron is 
      more costly than oral iron, the cost differential over time may be lower than 
      widely believed, and i.v. therapy avoids the poor absorption, gastrointestinal 
      intolerance and non-compliance associated with oral preparations. In terms of 
      safety, true anaphylaxis does not occur with modern preparations such as iron 
      sucrose and iron gluconate. The novel preparations ferric carboxymaltose and 
      ferumoxytol do not require a test dose and appear to offer a good safety profile, 
      but long-term safety monitoring is mandatory. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron 
      offers an effective, feasible route towards reducing the heavy burden of 
      iron-deficiency anaemia in the non-dialysis CKD patient, even in the absence of 
      ESA therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The optimal iron supplementation route of 
      administration (intravenous vs oral) in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) not on dialysis is a hot topic of debate. An oral preparation (liposomal 
      iron, FeSu) has recently been developed with high bioavailability and low 
      incidence of side effects. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of FeSu in 
      patients with stage 3 CKD and gastrointestinal intolerance to conventional oral 
      iron therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study of patients 
      with stable stage 3 CKD and gastrointestinal intolerance to conventional oral 
      iron therapy. An oral 30mg/day dose of FeSu was administered for 12 months. The 
      primary outcome measure was haemoglobin increase at 6 and 12 months. Treatment 
      adherence and adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: 37 patients aged 
      72.6±14.7 years and with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
      42±10ml/min/1.73m(2) were included. 32 patients had received previous treatment 
      with conventional oral formulations, 73% of which exhibited gastrointestinal 
      intolerance with treatment adherence of 9.4%. After 6 months with FeSu, an 
      increase in haemoglobin was observed versus baseline, which was sustained at 12 
      months (0.49±0.19 and 0.36±0.19g/dl, respectively, P<.05), despite a significant 
      eGFR decrease of 3.16±1.16 and 4.20±1.28ml/min/1.73 m(2) at 6 and 12 months, 
      respectively. None of the patients experienced adverse reactions that required 
      the treatment to be suspended. Adherence was 100% at both 6 and 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: FeSu is effective in a cohort of patients with stage 3 CKD with 
      similar characteristics to the general population of moderate CKD patients, with 
      a low rate of adverse reactions and excellent tolerability.

AB  - Abnormal iron homeostasis plays an important role in the anemia of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Although iron overload was the main complication seen in the 
      pre-erythropoiesis-stimulating agent era, relative iron deficiency is much more 
      common today in patients with CKD. Maintaining certain "desirable" levels of 
      commonly used markers of iron stores (such as transferrin saturation ratio and 
      serum ferritin) have become the goal of iron management in clinical practice, yet 
      it is unclear whether achievement and maintenance of these "desirable" levels 
      translates into improved clinical outcomes. This review examines issues related 
      to iron and long-term clinical outcomes from an epidemiologic perspective, with 
      the goal to determine what an ideal therapeutic approach should be in clinical 
      practice and what future research is required to clarify important practical 
      questions. Particular attention is devoted to patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent CKD because the management of iron homeostasis in this 
      group of patients poses additional intriguing questions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of iron deficiency anaemia in non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: The observational, cross-sectional 
      study was conducted at the Department of Nephrology, The Kidney Centre 
      Post-Graduate Training Institute, Karachi, from April 27 to October 26, 2018, and 
      comprised adult patients of either gender diagnosed with anaemia and estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate <90ml/min. Patient with transferrin saturation <20% 
      were labelled as having iron deficiency anaemia. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. 
      RESULTS: Of the 366 participants, 185(50.5%) were males and 181(49.5%) were 
      females. The overall mean age was 54.47±14.93 years. The most prevalent comorbid 
      was hypertension 263(71.9%), followed by diabetes mellitus 187(51.1%) and 
      cardiovascular disease 54(14.8%). Besides, 192(52.5%) patients had CKD stage 5 
      followed by 115(31.4%) and 54(14.8%) with CKD stages 4 and 3, respectively. The 
      mean haemoglobin was 9.17±1.57g/dL. Iron deficiency was found in 285(77.9%) 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency anaemia was found to be highly prevalent 
      and should be screened routinely and managed appropriately.

TI  - The Effect of Iron Supplementation on FGF23 in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: a 
      Systematic Review and Time-Response Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 4516-4524
LID - 10.1007/s12011-021-02598-1 [doi]
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) gene is found to be responsible for autosomal 
      dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, and is highly expressed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease patients with iron deficiency anemia 
      (IDA). We evaluated the efficacy of different iron treatments on FGF23 levels in 
      dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with IDA. We performed 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      comparing different types of iron treatment versus placebo in CKD patients up to 
      May 2020. We investigated the efficacy of iron treatment on the levels of FGF23 
      and C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) in CKD patients. We estimated weighted mean 
      differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the random-effects 
      model. Nine studies with 11 arms were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, 
      iron treatment showed a significant reduction in FGF23 levels compared to control 
      group (WMD: - 60.56 pg/ml, 95% CI: - 92.17, - 28.95). Compared to placebo, 
      subgroup analysis showed that oral iron therapy (WMD: - 6.98 pg/ml, 95% CI: 
      - 10.66, - 3.31) was more effective than intravenous (IV) iron therapy (WMD: 
      4.90 pg/ml, 95% CI: - 12.03, 21.83) on FGF23 levels. There was no significant 
      change in cFGF23 levels between iron treatment and control group (WMD: - 64.72 
      Ru/ml, 95% CI: - 147.69, 18.25). Subgroup analysis showed that oral iron therapy 
      resulted in a significant reduction in cFGF23 levels compared to control group 
      (WMD: - 150.48 RU/ml, 95% CI: - 151.31, - 149.65). In conclusion, iron treatment 
      was associated with a significant decrease in FGF23 levels in CKD patients.

AB  - Iron is essential for most living organisms but iron excess can be toxic. 
      Cellular and systemic iron balance is therefore tightly controlled. Iron 
      homeostasis is dysregulated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to 
      the anemia that is prevalent in this patient population. Iron supplementation is 
      one cornerstone of anemia management in CKD patients, but has not been rigorously 
      studied in large prospective randomized controlled trials. This review highlights 
      important advances from genetic studies and animal models that have provided key 
      insights into the molecular mechanisms governing iron homeostasis and its 
      disturbance in CKD, and summarizes how these findings may yield advances in the 
      care of this patient population.

AB  - Iron deficiency is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 
      use of oral and intravenous iron in patients with CKD who do not require dialysis 
      might obviate or delay the need for treatment with eythropoiesis-stimulating 
      agents (ESAs). Patients on hemodialysis have lower intestinal iron absorption, 
      greater iron losses, and require greater iron turnover to maintain the ESA-driven 
      red cell mass than do healthy individuals. In these patients, intravenous iron 
      reduces ESA dose requirements and increases the likelihood of maintaining levels 
      of hemoglobin within the desired range. Oral iron is inferior to intravenous iron 
      in patients on hemodialysis, in part because elevated serum levels of hepcidin 
      prevent intestinal absorption of iron. Increased levels of hepcidin also impair 
      the normal recycling of iron through the reticuloendothelial system. Levels of 
      serum ferritin and transferrin saturation below 450 pmol/l and 20%, respectively 
      are indicative of iron deficiency, but values above the normal range lack 
      diagnostic value in patients with CKD on dialysis. The availability of various 
      iron preparations and new developments in delivering iron should enable adequate 
      provision of iron to patients with CKD. This Review examines the efficacy, safety 
      and use of iron supplementation therapy for the treatment of anemia in patients 
      with CKD.

TI  - Safety concerns about intravenous iron therapy in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 260-7
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfv142 [doi]
AB  - Anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is managed primarily with 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron therapy. Following concerns 
      around ESA therapy, intravenous (IV) iron is being administered more and more 
      worldwide. However, it is still unclear whether this approach is safe at very 
      high doses or in the presence of very high ferritin levels. Some observational 
      studies have shown a relationship between either high ferritin level or high iron 
      dose and increased risk of death, cardiovascular events, hospitalization or 
      infection. Others have not been able to confirm these findings. However, they 
      suffer from indication biases. On the other hand, the majority of randomized 
      clinical trials have only a very short follow-up (and thus drug exposure) and are 
      inadequate to assess the mortality risk. None of them have tested the role of 
      different iron doses on hard end points. With the lack of clear evidence coming 
      from well-designed and large-scale studies, several data suggest that excessive 
      iron therapy may be toxic in several aspects, ranging from iron overload to 
      tissue damage from labile iron. A number of experimental and clinical data 
      suggest that either excessive iron therapy or iron overload may be a possible 
      culprit of atherogenesis. The process seems to be mediated by oxidative stress. 
      Iron therapy should also be used cautiously in the presence of active infections, 
      since iron is essential for bacterial growth. Recently, the European Medicines 
      Agency officially raised concerns about rare hypersensitivity reactions following 
      IV iron administration. The balance has been in favour of benefits. In several 
      European countries, this has created a lot of confusion and somewhat slowed the 
      run towards excessive use. Altogether, IV iron remains a mainstay of anaemia 
      treatment in CKD patients. However, in our opinion, its excessive use should be 
      avoided, especially in patients with high ferritin levels and when ESA agents are 
      not contraindicated.

TI  - Heme iron polypeptide for the management of anaemia of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 386-90
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12281 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Anaemia is a common clinical finding among patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with significant morbidity 
      and healthcare costs. Iron deficiency is an important contributing factor, and 
      adequate iron supplementation is essential to optimize the management of anaemia 
      of CKD. Oral iron is convenient and inexpensive but is poorly absorbed and 
      associated with gastrointestinal distress. Intravenous iron overcomes these 
      limitations but is more expensive, requires additional clinical visits for 
      administration and is associated with serious adverse events. Oral heme iron 
      polypeptide (HIP) is a newer dosage form that has been reported to have higher 
      bioavailability and fewer side effects when compared with non-heme iron in 
      healthy subjects, but data in patients with CKD are limited. The purpose of this 
      review is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of HIP for the management of 
      CKD. METHODS: Searches for PubMed (1947-2015) and International Pharmaceutical 
      Abstracts (1970-2015) were conducted using the following terms: heme iron, heme 
      iron polypeptide, oral iron, anaemia and chronic kidney disease. The bibliography 
      of each relevant article was evaluated for additional studies. Articles were 
      selected for review if they were published in the English language and were 
      randomized controlled trials evaluating the bioavailability, tolerability or 
      efficacy of oral HIP in human subjects with CKD. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This 
      search yielded three clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of HIP was 
      evaluated in a total of 161 subjects with anaemia and various stages of CKD. HIP 
      was consistently associated with lower ferritin values when compared with 
      traditional iron supplementation. With few exceptions, the effect of HIP on 
      haemoglobin, haematocrit, transferrin saturation and recombinant human 
      erythropoietin dose, and adverse effects appeared similar to intravenous and oral 
      non-heme iron supplementation. The cost of HIP is substantially more than 
      non-heme iron and comparable to intravenous iron. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: 
      Heme iron polypeptide does not appear to confer benefit over traditional iron 
      supplementation among patients with anaemia of CKD and is more expensive.

TI  - Phosphate binders for the treatment of chronic kidney disease: role of iron 
      oxyhydroxide.
PG  - 11-9
LID - 10.2147/IJNRD.S78040 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder is frequent in patients with renal 
      failure. It is characterized by abnormalities in mineral and bone metabolism with 
      resulting hyperphosphatemia, low serum vitamin D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, 
      altered bone morphology and strength, higher risk of bone fractures, and 
      development of vascular or other soft tissue calcifications. Besides the 
      recommendation to reduce phosphorus dietary intake, many drugs are currently 
      available for the treatment of calcium/phosphate imbalance. Among them, phosphate 
      binders represent a milestone. Calcium-based binders (calcium carbonate, calcium 
      acetate) are effective in lowering serum phosphate, but their use has been 
      associated with an increased risk of hypercalcemia and calcifications. 
      Calcium-free binders (sevelamer hydrochloride, sevelamer carbonate, and lanthanum 
      carbonate) are equally or slightly less effective than calcium-containing 
      compounds. They would not induce an increase in calcium levels but may have 
      relevant side effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms for sevelamer and risk 
      of tissue accumulation for lanthanum. Accordingly, new phosphate binders are 
      under investigation and some of them have already been approved. A promising 
      option is sucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro(®), PA21), an iron-based phosphate 
      binder consisting of a mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose, 
      and starches. The present review is focused on pharmacology, mode of action, and 
      pharmacokinetics of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, with a discussion on comparative 
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability studies of this drug in chronic kidney disease 
      and patient perspectives such as quality of life, satisfaction, and 
      acceptability. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide has proven to be as effective as 
      sevelamer in reducing phosphatemia with a similar safety profile and lower pill 
      burden. Experimental and clinical studies have documented a minimal percentage of 
      iron absorption without inducing toxicity. In conclusion, the overall 
      benefit-risk balance of sucroferric oxyhydroxide is deemed to be positive, and 
      this new drug may therefore represent a good alternative to traditional phosphate 
      binders for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients.

TI  - Iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of iron-induced kidney injury.
PG  - 385-98
LID - 10.1038/nrneph.2013.98 [doi]
AB  - In the past 8 years, there has been renewed interest in the role of iron in both 
      acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with 
      kidney diseases, renal tubules are exposed to a high concentration of iron owing 
      to increased glomerular filtration of iron and iron-containing proteins, 
      including haemoglobin, transferrin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 
      (NGAL). Levels of intracellular catalytic iron may increase when glomerular and 
      renal tubular cells are injured. Reducing the excessive luminal or intracellular 
      levels of iron in the kidney could be a promising approach to treat AKI and CKD. 
      Understanding the role of iron in kidney injury and as a therapeutic target 
      requires insight into the mechanisms of iron metabolism in the kidney, the role 
      of endogenous proteins involved in iron chelation and transport, including 
      hepcidin, NGAL, the NGAL receptor and divalent metal transporter 1, and 
      iron-induced toxic effects. This Review summarizes emerging knowledge, which 
      suggests that complex mechanisms of iron metabolism exist in the kidney, 
      modulated directly or indirectly by cellular iron content, inflammation, 
      ischaemia and oxidative stress. The potential exists for prevention and treatment 
      of iron-induced kidney injury by customized iron removal or relocation, aided by 
      detailed insight into the underlying pathological mechanisms.

AB  - The 'Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes' (KDIGO) Clinical Practice 
      Guideline for Anaemia in Chronic Kidney Disease includes detailed recommendations 
      for the use of iron therapy in a variety of clinical circumstances. However, the 
      evidence base regarding the use of iron therapy in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease was relatively incomplete at the time the guideline was developed. As a 
      result, there has been significant debate as to the appropriate use of iron 
      therapy in this population. In this article, the KDIGO guidelines are discussed 
      in the context of recently published commentary pieces and additional research to 
      provide a richer context in which to interpret and understand the guidelines.

TI  - Iron therapy in anaemic adults without chronic kidney disease.
PG  - CD010640
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010640.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia affects about a quarter of the world's population. An 
      estimated 50% of anaemic people have anaemia due to iron deficiency. OBJECTIVES: 
      To assess the safety and efficacy of iron therapies for the treatment of adults 
      with anaemia who are not pregnant or lactating and do not have chronic kidney 
      disease. SEARCH METHODS: We ran the search on 11 July 2013. We searched the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid 
      SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus 
      (EBSCO Host), the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science (ISI WOS) 
      Scientific Citation Index (SCI)-EXPANDED (1970) and Conference Proceedings 
      Citation Index (CPCI)-Science (1990) and Clinicaltrials.gov; we also screened 
      reference lists. An updated search was run on 24 November 2014 but the results 
      have not yet been incorporated into the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review 
      authors independently selected references for further assessment by going through 
      all titles and abstracts. Further selection was based on review of full-text 
      articles for selected references. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review 
      authors independently extracted study data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) 
      with 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and the mean difference 
      (MD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous 
      outcomes. We performed meta-analysis when possible, when I(2) was less than or 
      equal to 80% using a fixed-effect or random-effects model, using Review Manager 
      software. The range of point estimates for individual studies is presented when 
      I(2) > 80%. MAIN RESULTS: We included in this systematic review 4745 participants 
      who were randomly assigned in 21 trials. Trials were conducted in a wide variety 
      of clinical settings. Most trials included participants with mild to moderate 
      anaemia and excluded participants who were allergic to iron therapy. All trials 
      were at high risk of bias for one or more domains. We compared both oral iron and 
      parenteral iron versus inactive controls and compared different iron 
      preparations.The comparison between oral iron and inactive control revealed no 
      evidence of clinical benefit in terms of mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.61; 
      four studies, N = 659; very low-quality evidence). The point estimate of the mean 
      difference in haemoglobin levels in individual studies ranged from 0.3 to 3.1 
      g/dL higher in the oral iron group than in the inactive control group. The 
      proportion of participants who required blood transfusion was lower with oral 
      iron than with inactive control (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; three studies, N = 
      546; very low-quality evidence). Evidence was inadequate for determination of the 
      effect of parenteral iron on mortality versus oral iron (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.56 to 
      3.94; 10 studies, N = 2141; very low-quality evidence) or inactive control (RR 
      1.04, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.69; six studies, N = 1009; very low-quality evidence). 
      Haemoglobin levels were higher with parenteral iron than with oral iron (MD -0.50 
      g/dL, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.27; six studies, N = 769; very low-quality evidence). 
      The point estimate of the mean difference in haemoglobin levels in individual 
      studies ranged between 0.3 and 3.0 g/dL higher in the parenteral iron group than 
      in the inactive control group. Differences in the proportion of participants 
      requiring blood transfusion between parenteral iron and oral iron groups (RR 
      0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.58; two studies, N = 371; very low-quality evidence) or 
      between parenteral iron groups and inactive controls (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 
      1.06; eight studies, N = 1315; very low-quality evidence) were imprecise. Average 
      blood volume transfused was less in the parenteral iron group than in the oral 
      iron group (MD -0.54 units, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.12; very low-quality evidence) 
      based on one study involving 44 people. Differences between therapies in quality 
      of life or in the proportion of participants with serious adverse events were 
      imprecise (very low-quality evidence). No trials reported severe allergic 
      reactions due to parenteral iron, suggesting that these are rare. Adverse effects 
      related to oral iron treatment included nausea, diarrhoea and constipation; most 
      were mild.Comparisons of one iron preparation over another for mortality, 
      haemoglobin or serious adverse events were imprecise. No information was 
      available on quality of life. Thus, little evidence was found to support the use 
      of one preparation or regimen over another.Subgroup analyses did not reveal 
      consistent results; therefore we were unable to determine whether iron is useful 
      in specific clinical situations, or whether iron therapy might be useful for 
      people who are receiving erythropoietin. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: • Very low-quality 
      evidence suggests that oral iron might decrease the proportion of people who 
      require blood transfusion, and no evidence indicates that it decreases mortality. 
      Oral iron might be useful in adults who can tolerate the adverse events, which 
      are usually mild.• Very low-quality evidence suggests that intravenous iron 
      results in a modest increase in haemoglobin levels compared with oral iron or 
      inactive control without clinical benefit.• No evidence can be found to show any 
      advantage of one iron preparation or regimen over another.• Additional randomised 
      controlled trials with low risk of bias and powered to measure clinically useful 
      outcomes such as mortality, quality of life and blood transfusion requirements 
      are needed.

TI  - Acute-Phase Proteins and Iron Status in Cats with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 457-464
LID - 10.1111/jvim.14661 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of inflammation in the development and progression of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats is not well characterized. Hepcidin is a 
      recently discovered acute-phase protein (APP) that plays an important role in 
      iron metabolism and contributes to the development of anemia in humans with CKD. 
      OBJECTIVES: To compare serum APP concentrations, iron status, and erythropoietin 
      (EPO) concentrations in healthy cats and cats with naturally occurring CKD. 
      ANIMALS: A total of 18 healthy control cats and 38 cats with CKD. METHODS: 
      Prospective study. After complete physical examination and routine blood 
      analysis, the following tests were performed: serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin 
      (HAP), EPO, serum iron and ferritin concentration as well as total iron-binding 
      capacity (TIBC). Serum hepcidin-25 concentration was measured by ELISA kit 
      designed for use in humans. RESULTS: Mean SAA and hepcidin concentrations were 
      significantly higher and mean total iron and TIBC were significantly lower in the 
      CKD group (P < .05). There was a significant positive correlation between serum 
      creatinine concentration (CRT) and 2 of the APPs (SAA and hepcidin; P < .05). 
      Increases in SAA and hepcidin were associated with decreases in TIBC and 
      hematocrit in the CKD group. Fourteen (37%) of the cats with CKD were anemic, and 
      these cats had significantly lower TIBC (P < .05), suggesting a functional iron 
      deficiency. There was no association between survival time and APP, iron status, 
      or EPO concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CKD in cats is 
      associated with systemic inflammation and altered iron metabolism. With further 
      validation in cats, hepcidin assays may help better characterize these 
      relationships.

TI  - Evaluation of iron status in anemic pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 226-230
LID - 10.4103/njcp.njcp_234_19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on iron status are generally less readily available in 
      pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients than in the hemodialysis 
      population. In Nigeria, little is known about iron indices in patients with CKD. 
      AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the iron status among anemic 
      pre-dialysis patients with CKD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a cross-sectional 
      study design, we evaluated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) among 
      63 pre-dialysis CKD patients with anemia attending our outpatient nephrology 
      clinic. CKD was defined as a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min/1.73 
      m(2) for 3 months or more, while anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration 
      (Hb) less than 11 g/dl. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 52.5 
      ± 12.7 years and 33 (52.4%) of the patients were females. The most common causes 
      of CKD were hypertension (44.4%) and diabetic nephropathy (30.6%). The mean Hb, 
      mean serum ferritin, and mean TSAT were 9.2 ± 1.1 g/dl, 106.6 ± 72.7 ng/ml, and 
      24.3% ± 7.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in median 
      ferritin (91[interquartile range: 54-133] ng/ml versus 106 [interquartile range: 
      45-151; P=0.75) and mean TSAT (24.9 ± 7.2 % versus 23.8 ± 7.7 %; P=0.54) between 
      male and female study participants; Half (50.8%) of the study participants had 
      absolute iron deficiency (serum ferritin <100 ng/ml) and 6.3% had functional iron 
      deficiency (ferritin >100 ng/ml and TSAT <20%). CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency is 
      common among anemic adult Nigerian pre-dialysis CKD patients. Results of iron 
      studies should guide therapy when correcting anemia in these patients.

AB  - Anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex disease that requires an 
      integrated approach to incorporate both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
      and to address the different facets of its aetiology and pathophysiology. The 
      advent of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) has revolutionised the therapy 
      of anaemia of CKD, and has resulted in a significant decline in the need for 
      blood transfusions in CKD patients. The routine application of ESA has also led 
      to the need for concomitant iron supplementation. ESA and iron therapy now form 
      the cornerstone of anaemia management in CKD. Intravenous iron administration is 
      effective with acceptable safety, and may improve ESA responsiveness. However, 
      less is known about the long-term safety of iron supplementation in CKD patients. 
      Whereas maintenance (weekly to monthly) intravenous iron has been routinely used 
      in maintenance dialysis patients, iron replacement in patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent CKD is less well studied, in spite of the much larger 
      number of patients affected. This review discusses iron supplementation in CKD 
      with an emphasis toward controversial issues that continue to pose dilemmas in 
      clinical practice. Concerns related to both the optimal amount of iron

AB  - Background: Even though it is well-known that iron deficiency is the result of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), whether iron will affect kidney function and 
      disease in the general population is not clear. We thus conducted a nationwide 
      cross-sectional study using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey 
      (CHNS) to assess the relationship of iron status with estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) and CKD among general adults. Methods: A total of 8,339 
      adults from the China Health and Nutrition Survey in the wave of 2009 were 
      included to assess the association between iron status and eGFR/CKD. Serum 
      ferritin (SF), transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hemoglobin 
      (Hb) were measured. The relationship of iron status and eGFR was evaluated by 
      using multi-variable linear regression model. The effect of iron status on the 
      odds of CKD was calculated by logistic regression model. Results: For the 
      association between iron status and eGFR, every 100 μg/L increase in SF was 
      correlated with 0.26 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI: 0.08-0.44) decrease in eGFR, 
      and every 5 mg/L increase in sTfR was associated with a decrease of 6.00 ml/min 
      per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI: 3.79-8.21) in eGFR. There were no significant associations 
      between Hb or transferrin with eGFR. For the association between iron status and 
      CKD, every 5 g/L increase in sTfR was associated with an odds ratio of 3.72 (95% 
      CI: 2.16-6.13) for CKD. The concentrations of Hb were associated with the odds of 
      CKD in a U-shaped manner, with the lowest risk in the Hb range of 136-141 g/L. 
      There was a positive correlation between SF concentration and CKD prevalence but 
      not in a dose-response manner. The odds of CKD for participants in the highest 
      tertile increased by 28% (98% CI: 1-63%) compared with those in the lowest 
      tertile. Conclusion: The concentration of SF and sTfR was positively correlated 
      with the odds of CKD, and Hb was associated with the odds of CKD in a U-shaped 
      manner. Further large prospective researches are warranted to confirm these 
      findings.

TI  - Serum catalytic iron and progression of chronic kidney disease: findings from the 
      ICKD study.
LID - gfab271 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfab271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The non-transferrin bound catalytic iron moiety catalyses production 
      of toxic reactive oxygen species and is associated with adverse outcomes. We 
      hypothesized that serum catalytic iron (SCI) is associated with progression of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Baseline samples of the Indian Chronic 
      Kidney Disease participants with at least one follow up visit were tested for 
      total iron, iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, SCI, ferritin and 
      hepcidin. SCI was measured using the bleomycin-detectable iron assay that detects 
      biologically active iron. Association with the incidence of major kidney 
      endpoints, (MAKE, a composite of kidney death, kidney failure or > 40% loss of 
      eGFR) was examined using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for sex and age. 
      RESULTS: 2002 subjects (49.9 ± 11.6 years, 68.1% males, baseline eGFR 
      41.01 ml/min/1.73m2) were enrolled. After a median follow up of 12.6 (12.2, 16.7) 
      months, the composite MAKE occurred in 280 (14%). After adjusting for age and 
      sex, increase from 25th to 75th percentile in SCI, transferrin saturation, 
      ferritin and hepcidin were associated with 78% (43-122%), 34% (10-62%), 57% 
      (24-100%) and 74% (35-124%) increase in hazard of MAKE, respectively. SCI was 
      associated with MAKE and kidney failure after adjustment for occupational 
      exposure, hypertension, diabetes, tobacco, alcohol use, history of AKI, baseline 
      eGFR, uACR, and allowing baseline hazard to vary by centre. CONCLUSIONS: SCI is 
      strongly and independently associated with composite MAKE in patients with mild 
      to moderate CKD. Confirmation in other studies will allow consideration of SCI as 
      a risk marker and treatment target.

AB  - In contrast to managing patients on hemodialysis in whom iron strategies are more 
      focused on intravenous iron, nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 
      may receive either oral or intravenous iron. There are advantages and 
      disadvantages for both strategies. Oral iron is simple and cheap to administer 
      and does not require hospital visits, but is poorly absorbed in advanced CKD and 
      is associated with unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects. Intravenous iron, on 
      the other hand, guarantees iron bioavailability and avoids problems of variable 
      absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract, but requires specialist 
      clinic services. Intravenous iron also is associated with hypersensitivity 
      reactions, albeit very rarely. The efficacy of intravenous iron in improving 
      hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation is well established, and 
      superior to oral iron, but the long-term safety of this route of administration 
      has not been established and there are theoretical concerns that patients may be 
      exposed to increased oxidative stress and exacerbation of infections. The final 
      choice of iron management strategy will depend on individual physician 
      preference, as well as the facilities that are available.

TI  - [Parenteral iron therapy in chronic kidney disease or chronic heart failure].
PG  - A8769
AB  - Iron deficiency and anaemia occur frequently in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) or chronic heart failure (CHF) and are associated with lower 
      quality of life and higher mortality. Treating anaemia with erythropoietic growth 
      factors produces no improvement. In recent years, the focus has therefore shifted 
      to correction of iron deficiency. Chronic inflammation in CKD increases the 
      production of hepcidin, which blocks iron absorption from the intestine and leads 
      to less efficient re-use of iron from the macrophages. In absolute iron 
      deficiency the body's iron stores are depleted, whereas in functional iron 
      deficiency the supply of iron is not sufficient to meet demand from the bone 
      marrow. Normal or high ferritin levels do not exclude iron deficiency at tissue 
      level. The iron saturation fraction is a more useful indicator. Parenteral iron 
      therapy ameliorates in CHF the symptoms of iron deficiency, irrespective of the 
      effect on haemoglobin levels. The long-term effects of intravenous iron on 
      mortality and morbidity are still unknown.

TI  - Hepcidin is a potential regulator of iron status in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12001 [doi]
AB  - Hepcidin is a small defensin-like peptide produced primarily by hepatocytes, but 
      also by other cells, including macrophages. In addition to hepcidin's 
      antimicrobial properties, it is the main regulator of iron metabolism and 
      controls both the amount of dietary iron absorbed in the duodenum and the iron 
      release by reticuloendothelial cells. Hepcidin expression is upregulated by a 
      variety of stimuli, including inflammation and iron overload, and downregulated 
      by anemia, hypoxia, and iron deficiency. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
      associated with increased serum hepcidin levels, and the increased levels may 
      contribute to the development and severity of anemia and to resistance to 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Elevated serum hepcidin levels 
      contribute to the dysregulation of iron homeostasis in CKD patients. Although 
      parenteral iron supplementation can bypass some of the iron-blocking effects of 
      hepcidin in CKD patients with anemia, and free iron and iron stores increase as a 
      result, the anemia is only partially corrected, and the ESA dose requirements 
      remain significantly higher than needed for physiological replacement. Treatment 
      with agents that lower serum hepcidin levels or inhibit its actions may be an 
      effective strategy for restoring normal iron homeostasis and improving anemia in 
      CKD patients. The aim of this article was to review the regulation of hepcidin 
      levels and the role of hepcidin in CKD-related anemia, and to discuss hepcidin's 
      potential as a clinical biomarker and several investigational treatments designed 
      to lower serum hepcidin levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the association between hepcidin, iron 
      indices and bone mineral metabolism in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. METHODS: We reviewed the data of 2238 patients from a large-scale 
      multicenter prospective Korean study (2011-16) and excluded 214 patients with 
      missing data on markers and related medications of iron and bone mineral 
      metabolism, hemoglobin, blood pressure and causes of CKD. Multivariate linear 
      regression analysis was used to identify the association between iron and bone 
      mineral metabolism. RESULTS: The proportion of CKD Stages 1-5 were 16.2, 18.7, 
      37.1, 21.6 and 6.4%, respectively. Per each 10% increase in transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT), there was a 0.013 mmol/L decrease in phosphorus [95% 
      confidence interval (CI) -0.021 to -0.004; P = 0.003] and a 0.022 nmol/L increase 
      in logarithmic 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Ln-25OHD) levels (95% CI 0.005-0.040; 
      P = 0.019). A 1 pmol/L increase in Ln-ferritin was associated with a 0.080 ng/L 
      decrease in Ln-intact parathyroid hormone (Ln-iPTH; 95% CI -0.122 to -0.039; 
      P < 0.001). Meanwhile, beta (95% CI) per 1 unit increase in phosphorus, Ln-25OHD 
      and Ln-iPTH for the square root of the serum hepcidin were 0.594 (0.257-0.932; 
      P = 0.001), -0.270 (-0.431 to -0.108; P = 0.001) and 0.115 (0.004-0.226; 
      P = 0.042), respectively. In subgroup analysis, the relationship between 
      phosphorus, 25OHD and hepcidin was strongest in the positive-inflammation group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Markers of bone mineral metabolism and iron status, including 
      hepcidin, were closely correlated to each other. Potential mechanisms of the 
      relationship warrant further studies.

TI  - How to Supplement Iron in Patients with Renal Anemia.
PG  - 138-44
LID - 10.1159/000440773 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency is a major cause of hyporesponsiveness to 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and is often observed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients with anemia. With iron supplementation, ESA doses can be 
      decreased, resulting in lower treatment costs and possibly lower cardiovascular 
      risks that are associated with high-dose ESA therapy. The 2012 Kidney Disease: 
      Improving Global Outcomes Guideline specified ferritin ≤ 500 ng/ml and 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤ 30% as thresholds of iron parameters for CKD 
      patients. However, long-term safety (in terms of mortality, 
      cardiovascular/infection risk and tissue deposition) of high-dose intravenous 
      iron supplementation with such high target levels of ferritin/TSAT has not been 
      confirmed. Recently, there has been increase in the use of intravenous iron and 
      average ferritin levels in dialysis patients in the United States. Clinical 
      trials conducted so far have been underpowered to conclusively establish the 
      long-term safety of intravenous iron supplementation. Results from observational 
      studies are conflicting, and many experimental studies have even shown negative 
      effects of intravenous iron. Clearly, randomized clinical trials are urgently 
      needed, studying various doses of intravenous iron, with sufficient patient 
      numbers and longer observation periods, to investigate mortality, cardiovascular 
      effects and infection risks of this treatment. Until the long-term safety of iron 
      supplementation at high doses is established, a more prudent decision on iron 
      supplementation with lower target levels of ferritin/TSAT seems reasonable, in 
      light of the decades of experience with ESA that has shown that definitive 
      clinical outcomes have been dissociated from surrogate outcomes (especially 
      hemoglobin concentration).

TI  - Association of iron therapy with incidence of chronic kidney disease.
LID - 10.1111/ejh.14091 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of oral iron replacement with the 
      incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a population with normal kidney 
      function to study the effects of iron replacement on the development of new onset 
      CKD. METHODS: In a national cohort of US Veterans with no pre-existing CKD, we 
      identified 33 894 incident new users of oral iron replacement and a comparable 
      group of 112 780 patients who did not receive any iron replacement during 
      2004-2018. We examined the association of oral iron replacement versus no iron 
      replacement with the incidence of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and the incidence of 
      urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥30 mg/g in competing risk regressions and 
      in Cox models. We used propensity score weighing to account for differences in 
      key baseline characteristics associated with the use of oral iron replacement. 
      RESULTS: In the cohort of 146 674 patients, a total of 18 547 (13%) patients 
      experienced incident eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , and 16 117 patients (11%) 
      experienced new onset UACR ≥30 mg/g. Oral iron replacement was associated with 
      significantly higher risk of incident eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (subhazard ratio, 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 [1.22-1.38], p < .001) and incident albuminuria 
      (subhazard ratio, 95% CI: 1.14 [1.07-1.22], p < .001). CONCLUSION: Oral iron 
      replacement is associated with higher risk of new onset CKD. The long-term kidney 
      safety of oral iron replacement should be tested in clinical trials.

LID - 10.1016/j.dsx.2018.05.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Iron deficiency has been studied extensively in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis therapy. However, few studies looked at 
      iron treatment in the non-dialysis chronic kidney disease population. METHODS: 
      Five hundred and eighty patients were studied (247 were diabetic persons). 
      Patients were divided into 4 groups: non-diabetic subjects without CKD, 
      non-diabetic ones with GFR < 60 mL/min, diabetic persons without CKD and diabetic 
      ones with GFR < 60 mL/min). Iron deficiency was diagnosed when serum ferritin 
      level was <100 mg/dl. It was defined as diminished iron availability when 
      ferritin was above 100 mg/dl and serum transferrin saturation (TSAT) was <20%. 
      RESULTS: Anemia was more frequent in the diabetic CKD patients group (52.4%, 
      p < 0.001). Anemia prevalence was also higher in all CKD patients as well as in 
      diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic ones. Iron deficiency was more 
      frequent in diabetic patients. Among CKD diabetic patients the prevalence of iron 
      deficiency was higher than in non-diabetic CKD ones. Diminished iron availability 
      prevalence was higher in non-diabetic patients. Logistic regression analysis 
      showed that only sex and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with 
      iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia was more common in diabetic CKD patients. 
      Diabetes mellitus was independently associated with iron deficiency. 
      Surprisingly, diminished iron availability was not more frequent in diabetic 
      patients. The physio-pathological mechanisms that could explain these findings 
      remain to be elucidated.

AB  - Iron deficiency is common in patients on chronic dialysis, and most require 
      iron-replacement therapy. In addition to absolute iron deficiency, many patients 
      have functional iron deficiency as shown by a suboptimal response to the use of 
      erythropoietin-stimulating agents. Both absolute and functional iron-deficiency 
      anemia have been shown to respond to intravenous (IV) iron replacement. Although 
      parenteral iron is an efficacious method and superior to standard doses of oral 
      iron in patients on hemodialysis, there are ongoing safety concerns about 
      repeated exposure potentially enhancing infection risk and cardiovascular 
      disease. Each IV iron product is composed of an iron core with a carbohydrate 
      shell. The avidity of iron binding and the type of carbohydrate shell play roles 
      in the safe maximal dose and the frequency and severity of acute infusion 
      reactions. All IV iron products are taken up into the reticuloendothelial system 
      where the shell is metabolized and the iron is stored within tissue ferritin or 
      exported to circulating transferrin. IV iron can be given as large intermittent 
      doses (loading therapy) or in smaller doses at frequent intervals (maintenance 
      dosing regimen). Limited trial data and observational data suggest that a 
      maintenance dosing regimen is more efficacious and possibly safer than loading 
      therapy. There is no consensus regarding the preferred method of iron repletion 
      in patients on peritoneal dialysis, although small studies comparing oral and 
      parenteral iron regimens in these patients have shown the latter to be more 
      efficacious. Use of IV iron in virtually all hemodialysis and many peritoneal 
      dialysis patients remains the standard of care.

AB  - Anemia poses a threat to a broad population globally as depleted hemoglobin leads 
      to a plethora of conditions, and the most common cause includes iron deficiency. 
      Iron is an essential element important for erythropoiesis, DNA synthesis, 
      protection of the immune system, energy production, and cognitive function and 
      hence should be maintained at appropriate levels. Various proteins are involved 
      in transporting and absorption of iron, activation of heme synthesis, and RBC 
      production that could be possible targets to improve iron delivery. Oral 
      supplementation of iron either from dietary or synthetic sources has been the 
      frontline therapy for treating iron deficiency in anemia. At the same time, 
      intravenous administration is provided in chronic anemia, such as chronic kidney 
      diseases (CKD). This review focuses on the strategies developed to overcome the 
      disadvantages of available iron therapies and increase iron absorption and uptake 
      in the body to restore iron content. Nanotechnology combined with the food 
      fortification processes gained attention as they help develop new delivery 
      systems to improve iron uptake by enterocytes. Furthermore, naturally obtained 
      products such as polysaccharides, peptides, proteins, and new synthetic molecules 
      have been used in fabrication of iron-carrier systems. The establishment of 
      transdermal iron delivery systems such as microneedle arrays or iontophoresis, or 
      the discovery of new molecules also proved to be an effective way for delivering 
      iron in patients non-compliant to oral therapy.

TI  - Iron Deficiency and Nephrotoxic Heavy Metals: A Dangerous Interplay?
LID - 10.3390/ijms24065315 [doi]
LID - 5315
AB  - Heavy metals are common in our environment, and all individuals are exposed to 
      them to some extent. These toxic metals have several harmful effects on the body, 
      including the kidney, which is a very sensitive organ. Indeed, heavy metal 
      exposure has been linked to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      its progression, which may be explained by the well-established nephrotoxic 
      effects of these metals. In this hypothesis and narrative literature review, we 
      will shed light on the potential role that another highly common problem in 
      patients with CKD, iron deficiency, may play in the damaging effects of heavy 
      metal exposure in this patient group. Iron deficiency has previously been linked 
      with an increased uptake of heavy metals in the intestine due to the upregulation 
      of iron receptors that also take up other metals. Furthermore, recent research 
      suggests a role of iron deficiency in the retention of heavy metals in the 
      kidney. Therefore, we hypothesize that iron deficiency plays a crucial role in 
      the damaging effects of heavy metal exposure in patients with CKD and that iron 
      supplementation might be a strategy to combat these detrimental processes.

TI  - GDF-15, iron, and inflammation in early chronic kidney disease among elderly 
      patients.
PG  - 839-44
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1278-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to assess GDF-15 and iron status in patients in 
      early stages of chronic kidney disease with a particular emphasis on elderly 
      population in association of classic iron status parameters with novel iron 
      homeostasis biomarkers and inflammatory parameters. METHODS: Serum concentrations 
      of GDF-15, iron (Fe), transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor 
      (sTfR), hepcidin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 
      (IL-6), and hemoglobin were measured in 56 patients ≥65 years of age and in 31 
      <65 years of age. RESULTS: In patients ≥65 years, serum concentrations of GDF-15 
      and hsCRP were significantly higher in comparison with younger group. There was 
      no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin, iron, hepcidin, and sTfR 
      concentration between the two studied groups. In both groups GDF-15 was 
      significantly correlated with hemoglobin, eGFR, hsCRP, and IL-6. GDF-15 was 
      significantly higher in patients with anemia in comparison with their non-anemic 
      counterparts. In multivariate analysis, hemoglobin was found to be a predictor of 
      log GDF-15 (beta value = 0.36, P = 0.006, R (2) = 37 %). CONCLUSIONS: An 
      intricate interplay between renal function, anemia, and GDF-15 concentrations 
      awaits further studies, as there are few data regarding pathophysiological role 
      of GDF-15 in diabetes, kidney disease, and other comorbidities. Further 
      understanding regarding the signaling pathways of GDF-15 may help to discover 
      next pieces in the exciting puzzle of GDF-15. Finally, as studies dealing with 
      normal level of GDF-15 in the healthy aged are lacking, it is possible that the 
      higher values of GDF-15 values found in the present study represent values of 
      GDF-15 according to age more than CKD levels.

TI  - Issues related to iron replacement in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 479-87
AB  - Recent epidemiologic studies show that iron deficiency occurs in the vast 
      majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD, 
      increased iron losses and, to a lesser extent, poor oral absorption, can lead to 
      iron-deficiency anemia. Correction of iron-deficiency anemia is preferable by the 
      oral route, however, data on oral iron use are limited in this population. In CKD 
      patients, parenteral iron administered with recombinant human erythropoietin 
      (rHuEpo), is the best potential option for the correction of anemia. Nondextran 
      iron preparations are preferable because of a reduced incidence of serious 
      adverse events. Parenteral iron in CKD patients may not be entirely innocuous 
      and, although commonly used, have not received Food and Drug Administration 
      approval for use in this patient population. Exposure to intravenous (IV) iron 
      may lead to oxidative stress, renal injury, infection, cardiovascular disease, 
      and osteomalacia. Studies are needed to confirm the existence and magnitude of 
      these complications. The current data suggest that the overall risk-benefit ratio 
      favors use of IV iron when compared with untreated or partially treated 
      iron-deficiency anemia.

AB  - Intravenous iron products are essential for the treatment of anemia in end-stage 
      renal disease patients maintained on hemodialysis. Although proper use of these 
      compounds is necessary for the prevention of iron deficiency, their 
      indiscriminate use could potentially cause insidious adverse consequences. Iron 
      overload can intensify the chronic kidney disease-associated oxidative stress, 
      inflammation, and cardiovascular disease; increase the risk of infections; worsen 
      the severity of type 2 diabetes; and exacerbate neurologic and cognitive 
      dysfunction. These and other adverse effects largely are mediated by 
      iron-catalyzed generation of reactive oxygen species. Unlike conventional oral 
      iron products, the newly released iron-containing phosphate binder ferric citrate 
      has been shown to increase iron stores in end-stage renal disease patients. 
      Therefore, iron indices should be monitored in patients receiving this product. 
      Two published studies have shown a high prevalence of hepatic iron loading among 
      hemodialysis patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and 
      intravenous iron compounds. Given the potential risks related to iron treatment 
      in this vulnerable population, studies to better understand safety are needed.

TI  - Iron therapy in heart failure patients without anaemia: possible implications for 
      chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - i25-i31
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfx070 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health problem that manifests as fatigue and 
      poor physical endurance. Anaemia can be caused by dietary iron deficiency, blood 
      loss or a combination of poor iron absorption and ineffective iron mobilization 
      in patients with chronic disease. Nephrologists caring for patients with impaired 
      renal function understand that iron treatment is necessary to provide adequate 
      iron for erythropoiesis during the treatment of overt anaemia. However, a less 
      well-understood health problem is iron deficiency, which creates symptoms that 
      overlap with those of anaemia and often occurs in concert with chronic disease. 
      Recently, several randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted to 
      investigate the effects of treatment with intravenous iron in heart failure 
      patients with iron deficiency who may or may not also have anaemia. Given that 
      heart and kidney disease are often comorbid, these clinical trials may have 
      implications for the way nephrologists view their patients with iron deficiency. 
      In this article, we review several clinical studies of intravenous iron therapy 
      for patients with iron deficiency and heart failure and discuss possible 
      implications for the treatment of patients with kidney disease.

TI  - Hepcidin and HFE protein: Iron metabolism as a target for the anemia of chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 166-76
LID - 10.5527/wjn.v1.i6.166 [doi]
AB  - The anemia of chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis is characterized by chronic 
      inflammation and release of cytokines, resulting in the upregulation of the iron 
      hormone hepcidin, also increased by iron therapy and reduced glomerular 
      filtration, with consequent reduction in iron absorption, recycling, and 
      availability to the erythron. This response proves advantageous in the short-term 
      to restrain iron availability to pathogens, but ultimately leads to severe 
      anemia, and impairs the response to erythropoietin (Epo) and iron. Homozygosity 
      for the common C282Y and H63D HFE polymorphisms influence iron metabolism by 
      hampering hepcidin release by hepatocytes in response to increased iron stores, 
      thereby resulting in inadequate inhibition of the activity of Ferroportin-1, 
      inappropriately high iron absorption and recycling, and iron overload. However, 
      in hemodialysis patients, carriage of HFE mutations may confer an adaptive 
      benefit by decreasing hepcidin release in response to iron infusion and 
      inflammation, thereby improving iron availability to erythropoiesis, anemia 
      control, the response to Epo, and possibly survival. Therefore, anti-hepcidin 
      therapies may improve anemia management in hemodialysis. However, HFE mutations 
      directly favor hemoglobinization independently of hepcidin, and reduce 
      macrophages activation in response to inflammation, whereas hepcidin might also 
      play a beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-microbic action during sepsis, so 
      that direct inhibition of HFE-mediated regulation of iron metabolism may 
      represent a valuable alternative therapeutic target. Genetic studies may offer a 
      valuable tool to test these hypotheses and guide the research of new therapies.

TI  - ESA, Iron Therapy and New Drugs: Are There New Perspectives in the Treatment of 
      Anaemia?
LID - 10.3390/jcm10040839 [doi]
LID - 839
AB  - Anemia is a well-known consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD); it is mainly 
      due to a relative insufficiency of erythropoietin synthesis by the failing 
      kidneys. Over the years, the combination of erythropoiesis stimulating agents 
      (ESA) and iron has become the standard of care of anemia. All ESAs effectively 
      increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels in a substantial percentage of patients. However, 
      in the last decade, their use has been surrounded by safety issues in increased 
      cardiovascular risk, especially when used at high doses in inflamed and 
      hyporesponsive patients. This has led to the definition of a more cautious Hb 
      target. Iron deficiency is very frequent in CKD patients, with a higher frequency 
      in non-dialysis patients. Traditionally, iron supplementation is mostly used as 
      supportive therapy for anemia control. However, the concept is growing that 
      intravenous iron therapy per se could be beneficial in the presence of heart 
      failure. A new class of drugs, prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitors (PHD 
      inhibitors) is becoming available for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients. 
      Theoretically, these agents have a number of advantages, the main ones being that 
      of stimulating the synthesis of endogenous erythropoietin and increasing iron 
      availability. The impact of their future use in clinical practice is still to be 
      defined. Another possible strategy could be targeting serum hepcidin and its 
      related pathways. This possibility is fascinating from the scientific point of 
      view, but at present its development phase is still far from clinical 
      application.

AB  - NGAL, also known as lipocalin 2, is a stress protein located on the cell surface 
      that is known for its involvement in iron transport. This study is aimed to 
      evaluate the correlation between the iron profile and NGAL concentration in serum 
      among chronic kidney disease patients under dialysis in order to find its 
      diagnostic value with regards to iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). 47 patients under 
      chronic haemodialysis in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 15 healthy controls 
      were evaluated to determine the correlation between serum NGAL concentration and 
      IDA characteristics. Our results recorded a significant correlation between IDA 
      (TSAT < 20%) and NGAL serum concentration with a Spearman's coefficient of 0.314. 
      Serum NGAL was also significantly related to serum ferritin, TIBC, uric acid, 
      creatinine and blood sugar whereas, an inverse relationship with albumin, total 
      cholesterol and LDL. Our study reports a positive correlation between IDA and 
      serum NGAL levels in CKD patients.

TI  - Oral or intravenous iron for anemia correction in chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 673-5
LID - 10.1038/ki.2015.189 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be corrected by 
      the oral or intravenous route. The natural intestinal barrier against iron 
      overload is circumvented by intravenous iron. The balance between benefit and 
      risk of high iron doses remains unclear. In a randomized controlled trial in CKD 
      patients, Agarwal et al. find similar effects of oral and intravenous iron on 
      hemoglobin levels and kidney function decline but more serious cardiovascular 
      events and infections with intravenous iron.

TI  - Iron-restricted pair-feeding affects renal damage in rats with chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - e0172157

LID - e0172157
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that dietary iron restriction prevents the 
      development of renal damage in a rat model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      However, iron deficiency is associated with appetite loss. In addition, calorie 
      restriction is reported to prevent the development of end-stage renal pathology 
      in CKD rats. Thus, the beneficial effect of iron restriction on renal damage may 
      depend on calorie restriction. Here, we investigate the effect of pair-feeding 
      iron restriction on renal damage in a rat model of CKD. METHODS: First, to 
      determine the amount of food intake, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly given 
      an ad libitum normal diet or an iron-restricted diet, and the food intake was 
      measured. Second, CKD was induced by a 5/6 nephrectomy in SD rats, and CKD rats 
      were given either a pair-feeding normal or iron-restricted diet. RESULTS: Food 
      intake was reduced in the iron-restricted diet group compared to the normal diet 
      group of SD rats for 16 weeks (mean food intake; normal diet group and 
      iron-restricted diet group: 25 and 20 g/day, respectively). Based on the initial 
      experiments, CKD rats received either a pair-feeding normal or iron-restricted 
      diet (20 g/day) for 16 weeks. Importantly, pair-feeding iron restriction 
      prevented the development of proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and 
      tubulointerstitial damage in CKD rats. Interestingly, pair-feeding iron 
      restriction attenuated renal expression of nuclear mineralocorticoid receptor in 
      CKD rats. CONCLUSIONS: Pair-feeding iron restriction affected renal damage in a 
      rat model of CKD.

TI  - Iron Status and Inflammation in Early Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: One of the most common causes of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) 
      is chronic kidney disease. The main pathomechanism responsible for ACD is 
      subclinical inflammation. The key element involved in iron metabolism is 
      hepcidin, however, studies on new indices of iron status are in progress.The aim 
      of the study was to assess the iron status in patients in early stages of chronic 
      kidney disease, iron correlation with inflammation parameters and novel 
      biomarkers of iron metabolism. METHODS: The study included 69 patients. Standard 
      laboratory measurements were used to measure the iron status, complete blood 
      count, fibrinogen, prothrombin index, C-reactive protein concentration (CRP), 
      creatinine, urea, uric acid. Commercially available kits were used to measure 
      high-sensitivity CRP, interleukin 6 (IL-6), hepcidin-25, hemojuvelin, soluble 
      transferrin receptor (sTfR), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and 
      zonulin. RESULTS: Absolute iron deficiency was present in 17% of the patients, 
      functional iron deficiency was present in 12% of the patients. Functional iron 
      deficiency was associated with significantly higher serum levels of fibrinogen, 
      ferritin, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, hepcidin and older 
      age relative to patients with absolute iron deficiency. In comparison with 
      patients without iron deficiency, patients with functional iron deficiency were 
      older, with lower prothrombin index, higher fibrinogen, CRP, hsCRP, sTfR, GDF-15, 
      urea and lower eGFR. Hepcidin was predicted by markers of inflammation:ferritin, 
      fibrinogen and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Inflammation is correlated with iron status. 
      Novel biomarkers of iron metabolism might be useful to distinguish iron 
      deficiency anemia connected with inflammation and absolute iron deficiency.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hyperphosphatemia, iron deficiency, and anemia are powerful 
      stimuli of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) production and are highly 
      prevalent complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this manuscript, we 
      put in perspective the newest insights on FGF23 regulation by iron and phosphate 
      and their effects on CKD progression and associated outcomes. We especially focus 
      on new studies aiming to reduce FGF23 levels, and we present new data that 
      suggest major benefits of combined corrections of iron, phosphate, and FGF23 in 
      CKD. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies show that simultaneously correcting iron 
      deficiency and hyperphosphatemia in CKD reduces the magnitude of FGF23 increase. 
      Promising therapies using iron-based phosphate binders in CKD might mitigate 
      cardiac and renal injury and improve survival. SUMMARY: New strategies to lower 
      FGF23 have emerged, and we discuss their benefits and risks in the context of 
      CKD. Novel clinical and preclinical studies highlight the effects of phosphate 
      restriction and iron repletion on FGF23 regulation.

AB  - In treating moderate to severe anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), oral iron 
      is effective only in a minority of nondialysis patients. Intravenous iron is more 
      effective and can raise levels of hemoglobin even without the use of 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Unfortunately, the current assays of 
      iron status that are presently widely available are not especially helpful in 
      predicting response. In patients on dialysis, i.v. iron is effective over a wide 
      range of serum ferritin from <100 ng/ml to 800 ng/ml. None of the three available 
      randomized controlled trials comparing oral with i.v. iron showed evidence of 
      nephrotoxicity caused by i.v. iron. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for 
      thrombocytosis and should, wherever possible, be avoided. Optimal 
      coadministration of iron may reduce the risk for ESA-driven cardiovascular 
      events. Increased total body iron stores (imperfectly reflected by serum ferritin 
      levels in CKD) do not appear to be related to such events or hospitalization in 
      CKD; it is unclear what other risk factors and mechanisms need to be considered. 
      In the appreciable proportion of patients with both renal and cardiac 
      dysfunction, management is further complicated by a vicious circle (which can be 
      characterized as cardiorenal anemia syndrome) in which CKD, heart failure, and 
      anemia exacerbate each other. In such patients, correction of anemia appears to 
      improve cardiac function and quality of life without a greater risk for adverse 
      events.

TI  - Iron Therapy Challenges for the Treatment of Nondialysis CKD Patients.
PG  - 1269-1280
LID - 10.2215/CJN.00080116 [doi]
AB  - The clinical consequences of untreated, severe anemia in patients with 
      nondialysis CKD can be significant, but disparities exist in the anemia treatment 
      guidelines and position papers issued from working groups and associations across 
      the world. These differ in hemoglobin target and iron levels and their emphasis 
      on various iron markers and other clinical outcomes. Not surprisingly, 
      disparities are observed in anemia treatment strategies among patients with 
      nondialysis CKD across different areas of the world. Over the past decade, the 
      prescription and dosage of both iron therapies and erythropoiesis-stimulating 
      agents have shifted, with notable regional differences observed. Moreover, there 
      is ongoing debate regarding oral versus intravenous administration of iron. 
      Compared with oral iron therapy, which often leads to gastrointestinal adverse 
      events, low patient adherence, and low efficacy, intravenous iron administration 
      has been associated with potential serious adverse events, such as anaphylaxis. 
      New iron-based compounds and drugs currently under development are reviewed to 
      describe their potential benefits in the treatment of anemia in patients with 
      CKD. New oral compounds, including iron-based phosphate binders, heme iron 
      polypeptide, and liposomal iron, show different rates of absorption with possibly 
      different efficacy and improved tolerability. These new potential therapies offer 
      health care providers additional anemia treatment options for their patients with 
      CKD; however, the management of anemia in the CKD population continues to present 
      challenges that require prospective studies to identify the optimal iron therapy 
      for patients.

AB  - Iron deficiency is very common in chronic kidney disease, even before the 
      dialysis stage. It is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease. During chronic kidney disease, 
      iron deficiency is defined by a transferrin saturation <20% and/or a serum 
      ferritin <100 μg/L. In France, about half of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease 
      patients have absolute iron deficiency (transferrin saturation <20% and serum 
      ferritin <100 μg/L) and/or functional iron deficiency (transferrin saturation 
      <20% and serum ferritin >100 μg/L). Despite this, iron deficiency is usually not 
      investigated. In fact, more than 60% of nephrologists do not assess iron status 
      at least once a year. In addition, iron deficiency is rarely treated: only 12% of 
      patients are prescribed oral or intravenous iron. Early detection and treatment 
      are fundamental and should be systematic. In order to help improve the management 
      of iron deficiency among non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients, we propose 
      an algorithm that takes into account current recommendations and the most recent 
      data from the literature. Initial blood test requires the measurement of 
      hemoglobin concentration, transferrin saturation and serum ferritin. A 
      transferrin saturation <20% establishes the diagnosis of iron deficiency and the 
      serum ferritin level points towards an absolute or functional deficiency. The 
      combination of both values makes it possible to adapt the treatment, particularly 
      in an inflammatory context where oral iron is not effective.

TI  - FGF23 AND ALTERED MINERAL HOMEOSTASIS IN KIDNEY DISEASE AND FOLLOWING INTRAVENOUS 
      IRON.
PG  - 262-273
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an endocrine hormone that stimulates renal 
      phosphate excretion and suppresses circulating concentrations of 
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). These effects of FGF23 are most evident in rare 
      diseases that are characterized by FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemic 
      rickets-osteomalacia. More commonly, elevated FGF23 is a ubiquitous, early 
      consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in which it helps to maintain normal 
      serum phosphate levels but causes secondary hyperparathyroidism by suppressing 
      1,25D, and directly promotes cardiovascular disease and death. Elevated FGF23 is 
      also a common complication of intravenous administration of ferric carboxymaltose 
      (FCM), which is widely used to treat iron deficiency anemia. Among patients with 
      normal kidney function who receive FCM, the resulting increase in FGF23 and 
      subsequent FGF23-mediated reduction of 1,25D and secondary hyperparathyroidism 
      promote hypophosphatemia that can be symptomatic, severe, and associated with 
      musculoskeletal complications. Ongoing research is needed to design novel 
      therapeutic approaches to mitigate FGF23-related illnesses.

TI  - Hepcidin and iron metabolism disorders in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 368-73
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: [corrected] Hepcidin may play a pathogenetic role in iron 
      metobolism disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation 
      between hepcidin concentration and parameters of iron metabolism in patients with 
      different stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: The study involved 104 
      patients with CKD: 64 on hemodialysis (HD) and 40 patients in pre-dialysis 
      stadium (pre-HD) with adequate erythropoetin therapy and iron supplementation. 
      The HD group was divided in four subgroups according to the level of serum 
      ferritin (up to 100; 100-199; 200-499 and over 500 ng/mL). Parameters of anemia, 
      iron status, in flamation and hepcidin level were evaluated. RESULTS: The HD 
      patients had a significantly lower eritrocyte count, erythrocytes indexes, 
      hemoglobin and transferrin saturation and significantly higher iron, ferritin, 
      hepcidin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). The HD subgroups up to 199 ng/mL 
      of serum feritin had lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), iron and 
      higher unbuffered iron binding capacity (UIBC), transferrin saturation and TIBC 
      compared to the HD subgroups over 200 ng/mL. The lowest and the highest ferritin 
      subgroups had the highest hepcidin level and it showed significant correlation 
      with ferritin. CONCLUSION: Hepcidin may serve as a marker for better diagnosing 
      and monitoring anemia and iron metabolism disorders in CKD.

TI  - Iron status and erythropoiesis response to darbepoetin alfa in dogs with chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 601-608
LID - 10.1292/jvms.20-0574 [doi]
AB  - Iron metabolism, hepcidin and some blood profiles were investigated in 13 healthy 
      and 31 chronic kidney disease (CKD) dogs. The study consisted of 2 experiments, 
      experiment I included healthy dogs (CONT) and CKD dogs (stage 2, 3 and 4), while 
      experiment II consisted of anemic CKD dogs subjected to 28-day darbepoetin alfa 
      treatment. The response to darbepoetin alfa could divide anemic CKD dogs into 
      responder (RP) and non-responder (NRP) subgroups. The results from experiment I 
      showed that packed cell volume (PCV) and plasma albumin concentration were 
      significantly lower in CKD dogs of all stages while the total iron binding 
      capacity (TIBC) was lower in only CKD stage 3 and 4 compared with dogs in CONT 
      group. The PCV was related to both TIBC and albumin when considering among all 
      dogs or only in CKD dogs. The hepcidin concentration in CKD dogs with anemia was 
      lower than those without anemia (P<0.05). In experiment II before darbepoetin 
      alfa treatment, RP subgroup had significantly higher iron and TIBC compared with 
      NRP subgroup (P<0.05), the iron concentration was decreased only in RP subgroup 
      after darbepoetin alfa treatment (P<0.05). The percent increase in PCV was 
      correlated with initial TIBC (P<0.01). Plasma hepcidin concentration was not 
      different between CONT and CKD groups and between RP and NRP subgroups both 
      before and after darbepoetin alfa treatment. It is concluded that TIBC and plasma 
      iron concentration play role on anemia and erythropoietic response to darbepoetin 
      alfa treatment in CKD dogs.

TI  - Iron Administration, Infection, and Anemia Management in CKD: Untangling the 
      Effects of Intravenous Iron Therapy on Immunity and Infection Risk.
PG  - 341-353
LID - 10.1016/j.xkme.2020.01.006 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for infection, 
      attributable to immune dysfunction, increased exposure to infectious agents, loss 
      of cutaneous barriers, comorbid conditions, and treatment-related factors (eg, 
      hemodialysis and immunosuppressant therapy). Because iron plays a vital role in 
      pathogen reproduction and host immunity, it is biologically plausible that 
      intravenous iron therapy and/or iron deficiency influence infection risk in CKD. 
      Available data from preclinical experiments, observational studies, and 
      randomized controlled trials are summarized to explore the interplay between 
      intravenous iron and infection risk among patients with CKD, particularly those 
      receiving maintenance hemodialysis. The current evidence base, including data 
      from a recent randomized controlled trial, suggests that proactive judicious use 
      of intravenous iron (in a manner that minimizes the accumulation of 
      non-transferrin-bound iron) beneficially replaces iron stores while avoiding a 
      clinically relevant effect on infection risk. In the absence of an urgent 
      clinical need, intravenous iron therapy should be avoided in patients with active 
      infection. Although serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation can 
      help guide clinical decision making about intravenous iron therapy, definition of 
      an optimal iron status and its precise determination in individual patients 
      remain clinically challenging in CKD and warrant additional study.

TI  - Intravenous iron versus erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: friends or foes in 
      treating chronic kidney disease anemia?
PG  - 143-51
LID - 10.1053/j.ackd.2008.12.008 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those requiring 
      maintenance hemodialysis treatments, may lose up to 3 g of iron each year because 
      of frequent blood losses. Higher doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents 
      (ESAs) may worsen iron depletion and lead to an increased platelet count 
      (thrombocytosis), ESA hyporesponsiveness, and hemoglobin variability. Hence, ESA 
      therapy requires concurrent iron supplementation. Traditional iron markers such 
      as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation ratio (TSAT) (ie, serum iron divided 
      by total iron-binding capacity [TIBC]), may be confounded by non-iron-related 
      conditions. Whereas serum ferritin <200 ng/mL suggests iron deficiency in CKD 
      patients, ferritin levels between 200 and 1,200 ng/mL may be related to 
      inflammation, latent infections, malignancies, or liver disease. Protein-energy 
      wasting may lower TIBC, leading to a TSAT within the normal range, even when iron 
      deficiency is present. Iron and anemia indices have different mortality 
      predictabilities, in that high serum ferritin but low iron, TIBC, and TSAT levels 
      are associated with increased mortality, whereas hemoglobin exhibits a U-shaped 
      risk for death. The increased mortality associated with targeting hemoglobin 
      above 13 g/dL may result from iron depletion-associated thrombocytosis. 
      Intravenous (IV) iron administration may not only decrease hemoglobin variability 
      and ESA hyporesponsiveness, it may also reduce the greater mortality associated 
      with the much higher ESA doses that have been used in some patients when 
      targeting higher hemoglobin levels.

BTI - Biomarkers for Assessing and Managing Iron Deficiency Anemia in Late-Stage 
      Chronic Kidney Disease
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that 
      develops early in the course of CKD, and becomes increasingly severe as the 
      disease progresses. The management of anemia in CKD patients requires an 
      appropriate balance between stimulating the generation of erythroblasts 
      (erythropoiesis) and maintaining sufficient iron levels for optimum hemoglobin 
      (Hb) production. Thus, assessing iron status is integral to both iron and anemia 
      management in CKD patients, as iron is essential for Hb formation (as is 
      erythropoietin). However, classical laboratory biomarkers of iron deficiency 
      exhibit a wide biological variability in CKD. In response, newer, less-variable 
      markers have been proposed. PURPOSE: To summarize the literature on the use of 
      newer versus classical laboratory biomarkers of iron status as part of the 
      management strategies for iron deficiency in stages 3–5 CKD patients (nondialysis 
      and dialysis). DATA SOURCES: All published articles identified though MEDLINE(®), 
      and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to May 
      2012. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently selected studies on the basis 
      of predetermined eligibility criteria. We considered studies of pediatric and 
      adult nondialysis patients with stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD, patients with CKD 
      undergoing dialysis (hemo- or peritoneal dialysis), and patients with a kidney 
      transplant. Studies that compared newer laboratory biomarkers of interest such as 
      hemoglobin content in reticulocytes (CHr), percentage of hypochromic red blood 
      cells (%HYPO), erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), soluble transferrin 
      receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, and superconducting quantum interference devices 
      (SQUID), with classical laboratory biomarkers, such as bone marrow iron stores, 
      serum iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT), iron-binding capacity, and serum 
      ferritin were included. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted article 
      information into predesigned extraction forms; a second reviewer checked 
      information for accuracy. A standardized protocol was used to extract details on 
      designs, diagnoses, interventions, outcomes, and methodological issues. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: A total of 30 articles were accepted, including one Polish- and one 
      Japanese-language publication. We did not identify any study that provided data 
      directly addressing our overarching question (Key Question 1) regarding the 
      impact of using newer laboratory biomarkers on patient-centered outcomes 
      (mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and adverse effects). We identified 27 
      studies to answer Key Question 2, which addresses the performance of newer 
      markers of iron status as a replacement for or in addition to classical markers. 
      The synthesis of data for Key Question 2 was complicated by the lack of generally 
      accepted reference standard tests for determining iron deficiency in the context 
      of CKD. Of the 27 included studies, 15 used classical markers of iron status to 
      define “iron deficiency” as the reference standard in calculating the test 
      accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of newer markers of iron status. For the 
      purpose of our review, this approach was analogous to assessing the concordance 
      between classical and newer biomarkers of iron status; thus, these studies were 
      only included for subquestion 2a (What reference standards are used for the 
      diagnosis of iron deficiency in studies evaluating test performance?). The 
      remaining 12 studies investigated the test performance of newer or classical 
      markers of iron status, using a response to IV iron treatment as the reference 
      standard for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. We therefore synthesized these 12 
      studies for Key Question 2. Of these 12 studies, most studies enrolled only adult 
      CKD patients on hemodialysis (HD CKD patients), though a few examined adult 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) and nondialysis (ND) CKD patients. Only one study 
      enrolled pediatric CKD patients. Although the reviewed studies evaluated many 
      newer markers, such as CHr, %HYPO, RetHe, sTfR, hepcidin, and ZPP, the majority 
      assessed CHr or %HYPO among adult HD CKD patients. Based on our analysis, we 
      concluded that there is a low level of evidence that both CHr and %HYPO have a 
      similar or better overall test accuracy compared with classical markers (TSAT or 
      ferritin) to predict a response to IV iron treatment (as the reference standard 
      for iron deficiency). In addition, data from a few studies suggest that CHr (with 
      cutoff values of <27 or <28 pg) and %HYPO (with cutoff values of >6% or >10%) 
      have better sensitivities and specificities to predict iron deficiency than 
      classical markers (TSAT <20 or ferritin <100 ng/mL). There is also a low level of 
      evidence that sTfR has a similar test performance compared with classical markers 
      (TSAT or ferritin) to predict a response to IV iron treatment, but the strength 
      of evidence was insufficient to come to a conclusion regarding the test 
      performance of newer markers of iron status as an add-on to older markers, and 
      that of ZPP and hepcidin. It should be noted that, across studies, there exists a 
      high degree of heterogeneity in the test comparisons, definitions for the 
      reference standard (a response to IV iron treatment), iron status of the study 
      populations (assessed by TSAT or ferritin), and background treatment. This 
      heterogeneity may limit the comparability of findings across studies. For Key 
      Question 3 (impact on intermediate outcomes of newer markers compared with older 
      markers), we identified only two short-term RCTs (4 and 6 months), enrolling a 
      total of 354 adult HD CKD patients. We concluded that there is a low level of 
      evidence for a reduction in the number of iron status tests and resulting 
      intravenous iron treatments (a post hoc intermediate outcome) administered to 
      patients whose iron management was guided by CHr compared with those guided by 
      TSAT or ferritin. Both RCTs reported that Hct remained in the targeted ranges (an 
      indication for the adequacy of anemia management) throughout the study period in 
      all randomized arms, though the Hct target was higher in the U.S. trial than the 
      Japanese trial. For Key Question 4 (factors affecting the test performance and 
      clinical utility of newer markers), we included 3 studies (1 RCT and 2 
      prospective cohorts) as well as relevant data from all 27 studies included in Key 
      Questions 2; however, we found insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions, as 
      only single studies or indirect comparisons across studies provided relevant 
      data. LIMITATIONS: The available data are very limited due to a high degree of 
      heterogeneity. There exist many definitions of a response to IV iron treatment as 
      the reference standard for iron deficiency. Moreover, there is a lack of a 
      uniform regimen of intravenous iron treatment in terms of dosage, iron 
      formulation, treatment frequency, and followup duration for the iron challenge 
      test (to define a response) across studies. Many studies included in our review 
      were also rated as being at a high risk of bias, limiting their utility in 
      informing clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Combining the evidence addressing Key 
      Questions 2, 3, and 4, we can conclude that all currently available laboratory 
      biomarkers of iron status (either newer or classical markers) do not have an 
      ideal predictive ability when used singly to determine iron deficiency as defined 
      by a response to iron challenge test. Furthermore, we can conclude that there is 
      insufficient evidence to determine the test performance of the combinations of 
      newer biomarkers, or combinations of newer and classical biomarkers, for 
      diagnosing iron deficiency. However, it may be that CHr and %HYPO have better 
      predictive ability for a response to IV iron treatment than classical markers 
      (TSAT <20 or ferritin <100 ng/mL) in HD CKD patients. In addition, results from 
      two RCTs showed a reduction in the number of iron status tests and resulting IV 
      iron treatments administered to patients whose iron management was guided by CHr, 
      compared with those guided by TSAT or ferritin. These results suggest that CHr 
      may reduce potential harms from IV iron treatment by lowering the frequency of 
      iron testing, although the evidence for the potential harms associated with 
      testing or test-associated treatment is insufficient. Nevertheless, the strength 
      of evidence supporting these conclusions is low, and there remains considerable 
      clinical uncertainty regarding the use of newer markers in the assessment of iron 
      status and management of iron deficiency in stages 3–5 CKD patients (both 
      nondialysis and dialysis). In addition, factors that may affect the test 
      performance and clinical utility of newer laboratory markers of iron status 
      remain largely unexamined.

AB  - In non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients, looking for iron deficiency is 
      highly variable in practice and there is a great variability regarding the 
      cutoffs used to treat iron deficiency. The aim of this study is to investigate 
      the degree of iron deficiency in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients on 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. We included all non-dialysis chronic kidney 
      disease patients that applied to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health for 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents' coverage during a 5-month period. Iron 
      requirement was assessed based on two guidelines' target-to-treat cutoffs: 
      1-ferritin <100 ng/ml and/or TSAT < 20% (KDOQI 2006), 2- ferritin ≤500 ng/ml and 
      TSAT ≤30% (KDIGO 2012). A total of 238 CKD patients were included over 5 months. 
      All patients had a ferritin level in their record and 64% had an available TSAT. 
      Median age was 71.0 (59.8-79.3) years and 61.8% were female. All had an eGFR<60 
      ml/min. The proportion of patients found to require iron therapy ranged between 
      48 and 78% with a trend towards higher values when using KDIGO-based criteria. 
      Using ANCOVA test, inverse normal transformations of ferritin and TSAT showed a 
      reverse pattern between men and women with women being more iron deficient in the 
      early stage. Iron deficiency is highly prevalent in non-dialysis chronic kidney 
      disease patients on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents' therapy. These findings 
      reflect a lack in effective iron supplementation when managing anemia in 
      pre-dialysis patients, especially in men at advanced stages. Renal societies 
      should spread awareness about iron deficiency screening in those patients.

TI  - Limitations of Serum Ferritin in Diagnosing Iron Deficiency in Inflammatory 
      Conditions.
PG  - 9394060
LID - 10.1155/2018/9394060 [doi]
LID - 9394060
AB  - Patients with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
      chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high rates of 
      iron deficiency with adverse clinical consequences. Under normal circumstances, 
      serum ferritin levels are a sensitive marker for iron status but ferritin is an 
      acute-phase reactant that becomes elevated in response to inflammation, 
      complicating the diagnosis. Proinflammatory cytokines also trigger an increase in 
      hepcidin, which restricts uptake of dietary iron and promotes sequestration of 
      iron by ferritin within storage sites. Patients with inflammatory conditions may 
      thus have restricted availability of iron for erythropoiesis and other cell 
      functions due to increased hepcidin expression, despite normal or high levels of 
      serum ferritin. The standard threshold for iron deficiency (<30 μg/L) therefore 
      does not apply and transferrin saturation (TSAT), a marker of iron availability, 
      should also be assessed. A serum ferritin threshold of <100 μg/L or TSAT < 20% 
      can be considered diagnostic for iron deficiency in CHF, CKD, and IBD. If serum 
      ferritin is 100-300 μg/L, TSAT < 20% is required to confirm iron deficiency. 
      Routine surveillance of serum ferritin and TSAT in these at-risk groups is 
      advisable so that iron deficiency can be detected and managed.

TI  - Iron Replacement Therapy with Oral Ferric Maltol: Review of the Evidence and 
      Expert Opinion.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10194448 [doi]
LID - 4448
AB  - Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia globally and is frequently 
      reported in patients with underlying inflammatory conditions, such as 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Ferric maltol 
      is a new oral iron replacement therapy designed to optimize iron absorption while 
      reducing the gastrointestinal adverse events associated with unabsorbed free 
      iron. Ferric maltol has been studied in clinical trials involving almost 750 
      adults and adolescents with iron-deficiency anemia associated with IBD, CKD, and 
      other underlying conditions, and it has been widely used in clinical practice. It 
      is approved for the treatment of adults with iron deficiency with or without 
      anemia, independent of the underlying condition, and is commercially available in 
      Europe and the United States. We review the published evidence for ferric maltol, 
      which demonstrates consistent and clinically meaningful improvements in 
      hemoglobin and measures of iron availability (ferritin and transferrin 
      saturation) and shows that it is well-tolerated over long-term treatment for up 
      to 64 weeks-an important consideration in patients with chronic underlying 
      conditions such as IBD and CKD. We believe that ferric maltol is an effective, 
      convenient, and well-tolerated treatment option for iron deficiency and 
      iron-deficiency anemia, especially when long-term management of chronic iron 
      deficiency is required. Writing support was provided by Shield Therapeutics 
      (Gateshead, UK).

TI  - Clinical practice guidelines on iron therapy: A critical evaluation.
PG  - S125-S131
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12562 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it is 
      managed primarily with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and iron therapy. 
      Following concerns around ESA therapy and economic constraints, IV iron is more 
      and more administered worldwide. Several guidelines or position papers, which 
      give indications on iron therapy in CKD patients, have been issued in Nephrology. 
      Unfortunately, the field is characterized by a lack of evidence. As a result, the 
      recommendations/suggestions are not uniform. There is general consensus to 
      prescribe iron therapy to patients who are clearly iron deficient. In addition, 
      iron therapy may increase Hb values, delay the start of ESA therapy in ESA-naïve 
      patients and reduce ESA dose in ESA-treated patients. However, there is debate on 
      the safety and efficacy of IV iron therapy when given in the presence of already 
      high serum ferritin levels. In addition, not all the guidelines/position papers 
      differentiate between non-dialysis/dialysis patients and between the 
      presence/absence of ESA therapy. Many international Bodies or Societies suggest 
      caution when administering IV iron during infections. A trial of oral iron should 
      be considered as a first step, especially in the ND-CKD population. Finally, 
      recommendations on the prevention of anaphylactic reactions following IV iron 
      therapy are given by several bodies. There is consensus that IV iron is to be 
      administered in the presence of resuscitative facilities (including medications) 
      and personnel trained for emergencies.

TI  - Iron isotopic composition of blood serum in anemia of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 517-524
LID - 10.1039/c7mt00021a [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a general term for disorders that affect the 
      structure and function of the kidneys. Iron deficiency (ID) and anemia occur in 
      the vast majority of CKD patients, most of whom are elderly. However, 
      establishing the cause of anemia in CKD, and therefore making an informed 
      decision concerning the corresponding therapeutic treatment, is still a 
      challenge. High-precision Fe isotopic analysis of blood serum samples of CKD 
      patients with and without ID/anemia was performed via multi-collector inductively 
      coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) for such a purpose. Patients with 
      CKD and/or iron disorders showed a heavier serum Fe isotopic composition than 
      controls. Many clinical parameters used for the diagnosis and follow-up of anemia 
      correlated significantly with the serum Fe isotopic composition. In contrast, no 
      relation was observed between the serum Fe isotopic composition and the estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate as a measure of kidney function. Among the CKD 
      patients, the serum Fe isotopic composition was substantially heavier in the 
      occurrence of ID anemia, while erythropoietin-related anemia did not exert this 
      effect. The Fe isotopic composition can thus be useful for distinguishing these 
      different types of anemias in CKD patients, i.e. ID anemia vs. 
      erythropoietin-related anemia.

BTI - Evidence reviews for managing anaemia with IV iron in people with GFR category G5 
      who are on dialysis: Chronic kidney disease: Evidence review K
AB  - Many people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or established renal failure also 
      develop associated anaemia. The prevalence of anaemia associated with CKD 
      increases progressively with GFR category (anaemia of CKD can occur across all 
      stages of CKD, starting from category G2), especially when the patient reaches 
      category G4 or G5. Anaemia of CKD contributes significantly to the burden of CKD. 
      However, it is potentially reversible and manageable with appropriate 
      identification and treatment. The NICE guideline on chronic kidney disease: 
      managing anaemia (NICE guideline NG8) was reviewed in 2017 as part of NICE’s 
      surveillance programme. As part of the scoping process, NICE identified new areas 
      not included in the surveillance report for which the evidence needed to be 
      reviewed. One of these areas was IV iron for the treatment of anaemia associated 
      with CKD. The aim of this review is to determine what amount of IV iron is most 
      clinically and cost effective in managing anaemia and its associated outcomes for 
      people with GFR category G5who are on dialysis. This review identified randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) that fulfilled the conditions specified in Table 1. For 
      full details of the review protocol, see Appendix A.

TI  - Iron Status of Cats with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 1488-93
LID - 10.1111/jvim.13630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is a proposed mechanism for the anemia that occurs in 
      cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Minimal research investigating the iron 
      status of these cats has been performed. OBJECTIVE: To compare indicators of iron 
      status in cats with CKD versus healthy cats and cats with nonrenal illness (NRI). 
      To compare indicators of iron status in anemic versus nonanemic cats with CKD. 
      ANIMALS: Thiry-nine client or employee owned healthy cats, 40 cats with CKD and 
      34 cats with NRI included. METHODS: Exclusion criteria included prior iron or 
      erythropoiesis stimulating agent administration, blood transfusion, or concurrent 
      CKD and NRI. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, serum iron concentrations, 
      total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin concentrations were measured and 
      percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) calculated on all cats. Data were analyzed 
      using nonparametric statistical testing. RESULTS: No statistically significant 
      differences were detected among groups for iron concentration (P = .50), ferritin 
      concentration (P = .47), or TSAT (P = .19). TIBC was significantly lower in CKD 
      (median 262 μg/dL; IQR 233-302; range 165-488) versus healthy cats (median 316 
      μg/dL; IQR 272-345, range 196-464); (P = .0030). When comparing anemic 
      (hemoglobin <9.5 g/dL) versus nonanemic cats with CKD, TSAT was significantly 
      lower (P = .033) in anemic (median 20.2%; IQR 17.8-34.5; range 17.6-35.9) 
      compared to nonanemic (median 29.0%; IQR 25.5-44.1; range 11.5-94.4). No 
      statistically significant differences found for ferritin concentration (P = .94), 
      iron concentration (P = .21) or TIBC (P = .97). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL 
      IMPORTANCE: These results indicate that an iron deficient state exists in anemic 
      cats with CKD and is more likely functional rather than absolute.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of iron therapy in anaemic adults without 
      chronic kidney disease: updated and abridged Cochrane review.
PG  - 774-85
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.514 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Anaemia is increasingly recognized as having an independent impact upon 
      patient outcomes in cardiac disease. The role of novel iron therapies to treat 
      anaemia is increasing. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the 
      efficacy and safety of iron therapies for the treatment of adults with anaemia. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases and search engines were searched as per 
      Cochrane methodology. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of iron vs. inactive 
      control or placebo, as well as alternative formulations, doses, and routes in 
      anaemic adults without chronic kidney disease or in the peri-partum period were 
      eligible. The primary outcome of interest was mortality at 1 year. Secondary 
      outcomes were blood transfusion, haemoglobin levels, quality of life, serious 
      adverse events, and length of hospital stay. A total of 64 RCTs (including five 
      studies of heart failure patients) comprising 9004 participants were included. 
      None of the studies was at a low risk of bias. There were no statistically 
      significant differences in mortality between iron and inactive control. Both oral 
      and parenteral iron significantly reduced the proportion of patients requiring 
      blood transfusion compared with inactive control [risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.90; and RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.97, respectively]. 
      Haemoglobin was increased more by both oral and parenteral iron compared with 
      inactive control [mean difference (MD) 0.91 g/dL, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35; and MD 
      1.04, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57, respectively], and parenteral iron demonstrated a 
      greater increase when compared with oral iron (MD 0.53 g/dL, 95% CI 0.31-0.75). 
      In all comparisons, there were no differences in the results comparing patients 
      with and without heart failure. CONCLUSION: Both oral and parenteral iron are 
      shown to decrease the proportion of people who require blood transfusion and 
      increase haemoglobin levels, without any benefit on mortality. Further trials at 
      a low risk of bias, powered to measure clinically significant endpoints, are 
      still required.

LID - 10.11406/rinketsu.61.764 [doi]
AB  - Anemia remains an important complication of patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). Relative erythropoietin deficiency was assumed to be the main cause of 
      anemia in CKD. In contrast, it is possible that iron dysregulation for 
      erythropoiesis in CKD patients also affects not only anemia but also 
      cardiovascular event or survival of these patients. A prospective observational 
      study was conducted for 3 years on 1,000 maintenance hemodialysis patients. In 
      time-dependent cox hazard analysis, we found the higher risks of cardiovascular 
      disease (HR: 4.45, p<0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR: 5.8, p< 0.001) in 
      patients with low transferrin saturation (TSAT) (<20%) and high ferritin levels 
      (≥100 ng/ml) who are suspected to have iron dysregulation for erythropoiesis 
      compared with patients with high TSAT and low ferritin level. From these results, 
      we hypothesized that iron dysregulation in CKD patients is closely associated 
      with various complications and survival. Moreover, iron administration should be 
      approached with caution in patients who present with iron dysregulation for 
      erythropoiesis.

TI  - Oral iron supplementation: Potential implications for the gut microbiome and 
      metabolome in patients with CKD.
PG  - S28-S36
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12553 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and loss of kidney function are at 
      increased risk for morbidity and mortality. The risks of CKD are attributed to 
      "uremia," an increased concentration of uremic retention solutes (toxins) in the 
      plasma. Recently, a colo-renal axis became clearly apparent and uremia has been 
      associated with an altered gut microbiome composition and metabolism. There is a 
      high prevalence of anemia in patients with CKD, for which patients are often 
      treated with oral or intravenous iron. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have 
      reported adverse effects of oral iron supplementation on the gut microbiota 
      composition, gut metabolome, and intestinal health, which in turn may result in 
      an increased production of uremic toxins. It may also affect circulating levels 
      of other microbe-derived molecules, that can act as mediators of immune 
      regulation. Changes in body iron levels have also been reported to exert subtle 
      effects on host immune function by modulating immune cell proliferation and 
      differentiation, and by directly regulating cytokine formation and antimicrobial 
      immune effector mechanisms. Based on the foregoing it is conceivable that oral 
      iron supplementation in iron deficient predialysis CKD patients adversely changes 
      gut microbiota composition, the gut and systemic metabolome, and host immunity 
      and infection. Future studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses and to 
      assess whether, compared to IV iron supplementation, oral iron supplementation 
      negatively impacts on morbidity of CKD, and whether these adverse effects depend 
      on the iron bioavailability of the iron formulation to the microbiota.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The effect of roxadustat on iron homeostasis in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the 
      efficacy of roxadustat for the treatment of iron metabolism disorders in 
      dialysis-dependent (DD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD patients. METHODS: 
      We searched the PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Internet and Web of 
      Science databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes 
      were changes in serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT), ferritin, transferrin, and hepcidin. The secondary outcomes 
      included the changes in hemoglobin (Hb) and the incidences of adverse events 
      (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs). RESULTS: Twelve RCTs comprising 4976 
      participants were included. Compared to the control group, increases in the serum 
      iron (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.27, P < 0.00001), TIBC (SMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 
      0.82 to 1.22, P < 0.00001) and transferrin levels (WMD = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.41 to 
      0.69, P < 0.00001) were found in the roxadustat group. Compared to the control 
      group, decreases in the ferritin levels (WMD = -37.82, 95% CI: -59.89 to -15.74, 
      P = 0.0008) and hepcidin levels (WMD = -24.04, 95% CI: -36.28 to -11.79, 
      P = 0.0001) were observed in the roxadustat group. The meta-analysis showed that 
      roxadustat significantly increases Hb levels (WMD = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.12, 
      P < 0.0001). The incidences of AEs and SAEs in the roxadustat group was 
      significantly higher than that in the control group (RR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00 to 
      1.07, P = 0.04; RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.15, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings suggest that roxadustat could effectively improve iron metabolism in 
      patients with CKD.

      kidney disease patients: Perspective of the Spanish Nephrology Society Anaemia 
      Group.

AB  - This work presents an update on the management of iron deficiency in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD), either with or without anaemia. A review is 
      made of the recommendations of the guidelines for the treatment of iron 
      deficiency in CKD. It also presents new studies on iron deficiency in patients 
      with CKD, as well as new findings about iron therapy and its impact on clinical 
      outcomes. Anaemia is a common complication of CRF, and is associated with a 
      decrease in the quality of life of the patients, as well as an increase in 
      morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency (absolute or functional) is common in 
      non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients, and may cause anaemia or a low 
      response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. For this reason, the clinical 
      guidelines for the treatment of the anaemia in Nephrology indicate the correction 
      of the deficiency in the presence of anaemia. Iron replacement therapy is 
      indicated in patients with CKD and anaemia (Hb < 12 g/dl) in accordance with the 
      guidelines. There is no unanimity in the indication of iron replacement therapy 
      in patients with Hb > 12 g/dl, regardless of whether they have an absolute or 
      functional iron deficiency. Intravenous iron replacement therapy is safe, more 
      efficient and rapid than oral therapy for achieving an increase haemoglobin lels 
      and reducing the dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. For the 
      administration of intravenous iron in non-dialysis chronic renal failure patients 
      a strategy of high doses and low frequency would be preferred on being more 
      convenient for the patient, preserves better the venous capital, and is safe and 
      cost-effective. Iron plays an essential role in energy metabolism and other body 
      functions beyond the synthesis of haemoglobin, for which the iron deficiency, 
      even in the absence of anaemia, could have harmful effects in patients with CKD. 
      The correction of the iron deficiency, in the absence of anaemia is associated 
      with functional improvement in patients with heart failure, and in muscle 
      function or fatigue in patients without CKD. Despite the evidence of benefits in 
      the correction of iron deficiency in patients with CKD, more studies are required 
      to evaluate the impact of the correction of the iron deficiency in the absence of 
      anaemia on morbidity and mortality, quality of life and physical capacity, as 
      well as the long-term effect of oral and intravenous iron replacement therapy in 
      this population.

TI  - The Labile Side of Iron Supplementation in CKD.
PG  - 2612-9
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2015010052 [doi]
AB  - The practice of intravenous iron supplementation has grown as nephrologists have 
      gradually moved away from the liberal use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents as 
      the main treatment for the anemia of CKD. This approach, together with the 
      introduction of large-dose iron preparations, raises the future specter of 
      inadvertent iatrogenic iron toxicity. Concerns have been raised in original 
      studies and reviews about cardiac complications and severe infections that result 
      from long-term intravenous iron supplementation. Regarding the iron preparations 
      specifically, even though all the currently available preparations appear to be 
      relatively safe in the short term, little is known regarding their long-term 
      safety. In this review we summarize current knowledge of iron metabolism with an 
      emphasis on the sources and potentially harmful effects of labile iron, highlight 
      the approaches to identifying labile iron in pharmaceutical preparations and body 
      fluids and its potential toxic role as a pathogenic factor in the complications 
      of CKD, and propose methods for its early detection in at-risk patients.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Iron deficiency is a major factor in the prevalence and 
      severity of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We review the 
      pathophysiology impairing normal intestinal iron absorption in CKD and compare 
      the characteristics of newer intravenous (i.v.) iron agents to the longstanding 
      i.v. iron products in the market. RECENT FINDINGS: The newer iron products, 
      ferumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose, and iron isomaltoside, more avidly bind iron, 
      minimizing the release of labile iron during infusions, thus permitting large 
      dose infusions. These irons also have more complex carbohydrate shells than their 
      predecessors, which may also diminish reactions. Newer agents can be routinely 
      administered at higher single doses, in as little as 15 min, with an acceptable 
      safety profile. SUMMARY: Newer i.v. iron products permit the rapid, and sometimes 
      complete, repletion of iron-deficient patients with a single dose. However, 
      further studies examining the long-term risks and benefits of i.v. iron repletion 
      are needed.

AB  - Iron deficiency, both functional and absolute, is common in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), especially those requiring dialysis. Guidelines advocate 
      treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in patients with CKD and those on peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD). Oral iron is often insufficient and slow to improve hemoglobin 
      concentrations because of high hepcidin levels causing impaired absorption and 
      mobilization, while intravenous (IV) supplementation replenishes and maintains 
      iron stores more effectively and is now standard practice (Kidney Disease 
      Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] 2012 guidelines). However, there still remain 
      concerns about the effects of labile iron and possible increased risk of 
      infections for this group of patients.To date, the majority of published studies 
      have focused on hemodialysis (HD) patients; very limited data are available 
      regarding patients on PD. This review summarizes the rationale for iron therapy, 
      methods of treatment, potential adverse effects, and long-term concerns in PD 
      patients. In addition we highlight some interesting potential future therapies 
      under study.

TI  - Coupling fibroblast growth factor 23 production and cleavage: iron deficiency, 
      rickets, and kidney disease.
PG  - 411-9
LID - 10.1097/01.mnh.0000447020.74593.6f [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: High levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) cause the 
      rare disorders of hypophosphatemic rickets and are a risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease and death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      Despite major advances in understanding FGF23 biology, fundamental aspects of 
      FGF23 regulation in health and in CKD remain mostly unknown. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) is caused by gain-of-function 
      mutations in FGF23 that prevent its proteolytic cleavage, but affected 
      individuals experience a waxing and waning course of phosphate wasting. This led 
      to the discovery that iron deficiency is an environmental trigger that stimulates 
      FGF23 expression and hypophosphatemia in ADHR. Unlike osteocytes in ADHR, normal 
      osteocytes couple increased FGF23 production with commensurately increased FGF23 
      cleavage to ensure that normal phosphate homeostasis is maintained in the event 
      of iron deficiency. Simultaneous measurement of FGF23 by intact and C-terminal 
      assays supported these breakthroughs by providing minimally invasive insight into 
      FGF23 production and cleavage in bone. These findings also suggest a novel 
      mechanism of FGF23 elevation in patients with CKD, who are often iron deficient 
      and demonstrate increased FGF23 production and decreased FGF23 cleavage, 
      consistent with an acquired state that mimics the molecular pathophysiology of 
      ADHR. SUMMARY: Iron deficiency stimulates FGF23 production, but normal osteocytes 
      couple increased FGF23 production with increased cleavage to maintain normal 
      circulating levels of biologically active hormone. These findings uncover a 
      second level of FGF23 regulation within osteocytes, failure of which culminates 
      in elevated levels of biologically active FGF23 in ADHR and perhaps CKD.

TI  - Ferumoxytol for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 2563-8
LID - 10.1517/14656560903224998 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common problem in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Use of intravenous (i.v.) iron effectively treats 
      the resultant anemia, but available iron products have side effects or dosing 
      regimens that limit safety and convenience. OBJECTIVE: Ferumoxytol (Feraheme) is 
      a new i.v. iron product recently approved for use in treatment of IDA in CKD 
      patients. This article reviews the structure, pharmacokinetics, and clinical 
      trial results on ferumoxytol. The author also offers his opinions on the role of 
      this product in clinical practice. METHODS: This review encompasses important 
      information contained in clinical and preclinical studies of ferumoxytol and is 
      supplemented with information from the US Food and Drug Administration. 
      RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Ferumoxytol offers substantial safety and superior efficacy 
      compared with oral iron therapy. As ferumoxytol can be administered as 510 mg in 
      < 1 min, it is substantially more convenient than other iron products in 
      nondialysis patients. Although further experience with this product is needed in 
      patients at higher risk of drug reactions, ferumoxytol is likely to be highly 
      useful in the hospital and outpatient settings for treatment of IDA.

TI  - Iron Profile and Status of Anemia with the Associated Factors in Chronic Kidney 
      Disease Patients.
PG  - 129-135
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main complications of chronic kidney disease is anemia. 
      Disorders of iron homeostasis seen in such patients make the management of anemia 
      more challenging and risky. To obtain the desired result, erythropoietin and iron 
      dose must be carefully regulated. The aim of the study is to find out the 
      prevalence of anemia and level iron indices in patients of chronic kidney disease 
      at a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was 
      conducted on chronic kidney disease patients at a tertiary care center. 
      Demographic data like age, sex, height and weight were collected with the help of 
      using Performa. The hematological and biochemical study variables were assayed by 
      blood sample of the patients in the clinical laboratory services. Data were 
      analyzed by statistical package for the social sciences Version 20.0 Results: Out 
      of 171 patients with chronic kidney disease, 162 (94.7%) were anemic, with the 
      highest percentage 54 (31.5%) having hypertension. The median value with 
      inter-quartile range of hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, TIBC and 
      transferring saturation were 8.9 gm/dl (6.7-10.0), 115.0 (µg/dl) (60.0-140.0), 
      599.0 ng/ml (142.6-973.0), 279.0 µg/dl (250.0-342.0) and 41.0 % (22.0-53.0) 
      respectively. Serum creatinine and eGFR were significantly correlated with 
      hemoglobin and iron indices. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that anemia 
      was more prevalent in patients of chronic kidney disease in our setting as 
      compared to similar studies. Hypertension was the most common disease among them. 
      The median value of parameters of iron profile except ferritin among them was 
      within the reference limit.

TI  - Iron therapy for renal anemia: how much needed, how much harmful?
PG  - 480-9
AB  - Iron deficiency is the most common cause of hyporesponsiveness to 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients. Iron deficiency can easily be corrected by intravenous iron 
      administration, which is more effective than oral iron supplementation, at least 
      in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron status can be monitored 
      by different parameters such as ferritin, transferrin saturation, percentage of 
      hypochromic red blood cells, and/or the reticulocyte hemoglobin content, but an 
      increased erythropoietic response to iron supplementation is the most widely 
      accepted reference standard of iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Parenteral iron 
      therapy is not without acute and chronic adverse events. While provocative animal 
      and in vitro studies suggest induction of inflammation, oxidative stress, and 
      kidney damage by available parenteral iron preparations, several recent clinical 
      studies showed the opposite effects as long as intravenous iron was adequately 
      dosed. Thus, within the recommended international guidelines, parenteral iron 
      administration is safe. Intravenous iron therapy should be withheld during acute 
      infection but not during inflammation. The integration of ESA and intravenous 
      iron therapy into anemia management allowed attainment of target hemoglobin 
      values in the majority of pediatric and adult CKD and ESRD patients.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of sevelamer and lanthanum versus calcium-containing and 
      iron-based binders in treating hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 111-125
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains unclear which phosphate binders should be preferred for 
      hyperphosphatemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: We 
      performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing 
      sevelamer or lanthanum with other phosphate binders in CKD. RESULTS: Fifty-one 
      trials (8829 patients) were reviewed. Compared with calcium-based binders, 
      all-cause mortality was nonsignificantly lower with sevelamer {risk ratio [RR] 
      0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-1.08]} and lanthanum [RR 0.73 (95% CI 
      0.18-3.00)], but risk of bias was concerning. Compared with calcium-based 
      binders, sevelamer reduced the risk of hypercalcemia [RR 0.27 (95% CI 
      0.17-0.42)], as did lanthanum [RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.05-0.32)]. Sevelamer reduced 
      hospitalizations [RR 0.50 (95% CI 0.31-0.81)], but not lanthanum [RR 0.80 (95% CI 
      0.34-1.93)]. The presence/absence of other clinically relevant outcomes was 
      infrequently reported. Compared with calcium-based binders, sevelamer reduced 
      serum calcium, low-density lipoprotein and coronary artery calcification, but 
      increased intact parathyroid hormone. The clinical relevance of these changes is 
      unknown since corresponding clinical outcomes were not reported. Lanthanum had 
      less favorable impact on biochemical parameters. Sevelamer hydrochloride and 
      sevelamer carbonate were similar in three studies. Sevelamer was similar to 
      lanthanum (three studies) and iron-based binders (three studies). CONCLUSION: 
      Sevelamer was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality and 
      significantly lower hospitalization rates and hypercalcemia compared with 
      calcium-based binders. However, differences in important outcomes, such as 
      cardiac events, fractures, calciphylaxis, hyperchloremic acidosis and 
      health-related quality of life remain understudied. Lanthanum and iron-based 
      binders did not show superiority for any clinically relevant outcomes. Future 
      studies that fail to measure clinically important outcomes (the reason why 
      phosphate binders are prescribed in the first place) will be wasteful.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional iron deficiency has been found to be a common cause of 
      poor response to erythropoiesis stimulating agents in anaemic patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVES: Assess the functional iron status of 
      patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: This was a hospital based cross 
      sectional study. The study subjects were chronic kidney disease patients with age 
      and sex matched healthy controls. Full blood count, serum ferritin, soluble 
      transferring receptor, C-reactive protein, serum iron and total iron binding 
      capacity were measured in the patients and healthy controls.Data was analyzed 
      with statistical package for the social sciences software version 22.0. And the 
      level of statistical significance was set at p. value < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean ± 
      SD of the age of patient with CKD was 55.0 + 15.4 years, while that of controls 
      was 52.7 + 13.6 years. The mean serum ferritin, serum iron, TIBC and CRP were 
      significantly higher in patients compared with controls (p<0.001, 0.023, <0.001 
      and 0.001) respectively. Functional iron deficiency was seen in 19.5% of patients 
      with CKD. CONCLUSION: The predominant form of iron deficiency in our study was 
      functional iron deficiency.

TI  - Serum ferritin in chronic kidney disease: reconsidering the upper limit for iron 
      treatment.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Intravenous iron treatment in hemodialysis patients improves the response to 
      recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and facilitates achievement of targets 
      for hemoglobin and hematocrit. Excessive treatment, however, could expose 
      patients to risks related to iron overload and oxidative stress. Therefore 
      international treatment guidelines generally recommend that intravenous iron be 
      discontinued when serum ferritin is greater than 500-1000 ng/ml. In this article 
      we explore the relevant issues that inform the decisions as to what levels of 
      serum ferritin are used as the upper limit for treatment. We conclude that the 
      current published literature is inadequate for developing evidence-based 
      guidelines. Clinical judgment is critical to properly weigh the risks and 
      benefits of intravenous iron treatment in the context of the individual patient.

TI  - Controversies in iron management.
PG  - S64-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron therapy is required in hemodialysis patients receiving 
      erythropoietic stimulators in order to achieve the target hemoglobin in the most 
      efficient way. While oral iron has been disappointing in this regard, parenteral 
      iron has been widely used, despite a significant incidence of severe side effects 
      when iron dextran is used. The recent availability of a more effective form of 
      oral iron (heme-iron), and safer forms of parenteral iron (iron sucrose and iron 
      gluconate) has made iron management in this population simpler. Many questions 
      remain, however, about the use, efficacy, and safety of these compounds in 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Current literature was reviewed and combined with 
      the authors' clinical experience to address a number of current questions 
      regarding the use of iron in hemodialysis patients. RESULTS: Although oral 
      non-heme iron is infrequently sufficient to maintain iron stores in hemodialysis 
      patients, recent studies suggest that heme-iron may be more useful in this 
      regard. Heme-iron is absorbed to a greater extent than non-heme iron, and is 
      better tolerated. Small studies have shown that when heme-iron is administered, 
      less parenteral iron and lower doses of erythropoietin (EPO) are needed to 
      maintain target hemoglobin. Current evidence suggests that both iron sucrose and 
      iron gluconate are safer than iron dextran, and the latter should only be used in 
      extraordinary circumstances. While in vitro studies have demonstrated some 
      differences in the effects of iron sucrose and iron gluconate on cellular 
      toxicity, the clinical importance of these has not been determined. Both 
      compounds can be used safely for repletion and maintenance therapy, and doses of 
      up to 300 mg of either are generally well tolerated when such higher doses are 
      needed, as in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients or chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients not on dialysis. CONCLUSION: A number of questions remain regarding the 
      appropriate use, efficacy, and potential toxicity of iron therapy in dialysis 
      patients. Further prospective research should address the myriad questions raised 
      in this review.

TI  - Toxic effects of IV iron preparations in CKD patients.
PG  - 4-5
AB  - Loss of blood associated with hemodialysis procedures and laboratory testing, 
      together with impaired iron absorption due to elevation of hepcidin, invariably 
      cause iron deficiency in end-stage renal disease patients. For this reason, 
      nearly all ESRD patients require intravenous iron to replete iron stores. 
      Unfortunately, intravenously administered iron is often used routinely with 
      inadequate attention to the body iron stores or severity of systemic 
      inflammation. This has led to an epidemic of iron overload in the ESRD 
      population. Only a minute amount (3-4 mg) of the total body iron (3-4 g in an 
      adult man) resides in the plasma bound to transferrin, which serves as a safe 
      vehicle for iron transport in the circulation. IV iron products are generally 
      administered as bolus injections of 100 to 1000 mg, which far exceeds the 
      available pool of free transferrin and represents a huge quantity compared to the 
      intestinal iron absorption of 1 to 2 mg/day in the course of 3 to 4 meals. 
      Administration of these products results in an increased plasma level of 
      catalytically active non-transferrin bound iron and the rise in the biomarkers of 
      oxidative stress and inflammation. IV iron bypasses the biological safeguards for 
      the transport and handling of iron and helps to intensify chronic kidney 
      disease-associated oxidative stress and inflammation. As briefly described in 
      this review, indiscriminate use of IV iron can accelerate cardiovascular disease, 
      promote microbial infections, aggravate viral hepatitis, and worsen diabetes and 
      diabetic complications in such patients. For these reasons IV iron should be used 
      judiciously in this vulnerable population.

TI  - Novel iron-based phosphate binders in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 330-5
LID - 10.1097/MNH.0000000000000128 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Management of hyperphosphatemia remains an integral component 
      in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. In addition to 
      dietary restriction and dialysis, oral phosphate binders remain a key strategy in 
      the control of serum phosphorus levels in this population. We review two new oral 
      phosphate binders that are currently marketed in the United States. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) in November 2013. A recent international, multicenter study 
      found the drug to be efficacious and noninferior to sevelamer carbonate in 
      magnitude of serum phosphate control. This was achieved with a significantly 
      reduced daily pill burden for sucroferric oxyhydroxide. A second novel agent, 
      ferric citrate was approved by the FDA in September, 2014. The drug was found to 
      have similar phosphate control efficacy to active comparators and was superior to 
      placebo. In addition, the drug delivers a significant amount of iron, resulting 
      in improved erythropoietic parameters. Both drugs had diarrhea as a fairly 
      frequent side-effect. SUMMARY: These new phosphate binders offer alternatives to 
      currently available agents. Both have interesting properties that may make them 
      particularly useful in clinical practice.

TI  - Zonulin, inflammation and iron status in patients with early stages of chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 121-125
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1741-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Zonulin is the only known regulator of intestinal permeability. 
      It is also considered as a potential inflammatory marker in several conditions 
      such as diabetes and inflammatory bowel syndrome. The aim of the study was to 
      investigate zonulin levels in patients with early stages of CKD and its possible 
      correlation with inflammation, anemia and iron status parameters. METHODS: 
      Eighty-eight patients with early stages of CKD and 23 healthy volunteers were 
      enrolled in the study. Zonulin, hepcidin-25, soluble transferrin receptor, 
      interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured using 
      commercially available assays. RESULTS: Zonulin was significantly lower among 
      patients with CKD in comparison with healthy volunteers. There were no 
      statistically significant differences in zonulin concentration between patients 
      with and without inflammation. Zonulin was significantly correlated with hepcidin 
      only in patients with inflammation. Zonulin was neither related to iron nor 
      related to ferritin. CONCLUSIONS: Zonulin cannot be considered as an inflammatory 
      marker in CKD. It does not play a role in the disturbances of iron metabolism in 
      CKD. Its physiological role remains to be elucidated.

BTI - Biomarkers for Assessing and Managing Iron Deficiency Anemia in Late-Stage 
      Chronic Kidney Disease: Future Research Needs: Identification of Future Research 
      Needs From Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 83
AB  - Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which develops 
      early in the course of CKD and becomes increasingly severe as kidney function 
      deteriorates. Iron deficiency anemia is a continuous process evolving in three 
      stages. The first phase is the depletion of storage iron (stage I), where total 
      body iron is decreased but hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis and red cell indices remain 
      unaffected. Both these indices change when the supply of iron to bone marrow 
      becomes problematic (iron deficient erythropoiesis, or stage II). In stage III 
      the iron supply is insufficient to maintain a normal Hb concentration, and 
      eventually iron deficiency anemia develops. The management of anemia in CKD 
      patients must strike an appropriate balance between stimulating generation of 
      erythroblasts (erythropoiesis) and maintaining sufficient iron levels for optimum 
      Hb production. It is important to assess iron stores and the availability of iron 
      for erythropoiesis, as adequate iron status is integral to both iron and anemia 
      management in CKD patients. The major cause of iron deficiency is blood loss, 
      particularly for dialysis patients. Dialysis patients are in a state of 
      continuous iron loss from gastrointestinal bleeding (very common), blood drawing, 
      and/or, most importantly, with hemodialysis, the dialysis treatment itself. A CKD 
      patient who receives treatment with erythropoietic-stimulating agents (ESAs) for 
      the anemia often develops iron deficiency, because the iron requirements for 
      achieving a response to ESA treatment usually cannot be met by mobilization of 
      the patient’s iron stores alone. Therefore, supplemental iron therapy, either 
      given orally or intravenously, is often needed among dialysis patients who 
      receive recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) or darbepoetin alfa treatment. 
      Thus, iron management (iron status assessment and iron treatment) is an essential 
      part of the treatment of anemia associated with CKD, as there are concerns 
      regarding the adverse effects associated with both elevated doses of ESAs and 
      supplemental (intravenous or oral) iron. Classical iron status tests, of which 
      ferritin and transferring saturation (TSAT) are the most widely used, reflect 
      either the level of iron in tissue stores or the adequacy of iron for 
      erythropoiesis. Though widely used, classical laboratory biomarkers of iron 
      status are not without drawbacks when used in CKD patients: CKD is a 
      pro-inflammatory state, and the biological variability of serum iron, transferrin 
      saturation, and ferritin is known to be large in the context of underlying 
      inflammation. Furthermore, results from a meta-analysis of 55 studies (published 
      before 1990) showed that ferritin radioimmunoassay was the most powerful test (a 
      mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95; 95% CI 0.94, 
      0.96), compared with mean cell volume determination, TSAT, and red cell volume 
      distribution, for diagnosing adult patients with iron deficiency, but test 
      performances varied between patients with and those without inflammatory (e.g., 
      CKD patients) or liver disease. The accurate assessment of iron status is 
      dependent on the validity and reliability of laboratory test results, and 
      differences in test performance pose a dilemma regarding the most appropriate 
      test to guide treatment decisions.

TI  - Serum iron level and kidney function: a Mendelian randomization study.
PG  - 273-278
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron depletion is a known consequence of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), but there is contradicting epidemiological evidence on whether iron itself 
      affects kidney function and whether its effect is protective or detrimental in 
      the general population. While epidemiological studies tend to be affected by 
      confounding and reverse causation, Mendelian randomization (MR) can provide 
      unconfounded estimates of causal effects by using genes as instruments. METHODS: 
      We performed an MR study of the effect of serum iron levels on estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using genetic variants known to be associated 
      with iron. MR estimates of the effect of iron on eGFR were derived based on the 
      association of each variant with iron and eGFR from two large genome-wide 
      meta-analyses on 48 978 and 74 354 individuals. We performed a similar MR 
      analysis for ferritin, which measures iron stored in the body, using variants 
      associated with ferritin. RESULTS: A combined MR estimate across all variants 
      showed a 1.3% increase in eGFR per standard deviation increase in iron (95% 
      confidence interval 0.4–2.1%; P = 0.004). The results for ferritin were 
      consistent with those for iron. Secondary MR analyses of the effects of iron and 
      ferritin on CKD did not show significant associations but had very low 
      statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a protective effect of iron on 
      kidney function in the general population. Further research is required to 
      confirm this causal association, investigate it in study populations at higher 
      risk of CKD and explore its underlying mechanism of action.

TI  - Intravenous versus oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency in 
      non-hemodialysis-dependent patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1206-11
LID - 10.2146/ajhp110231 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The evidence evaluating the efficacy of i.v. versus oral iron for the 
      treatment of iron deficiency in non-hemodialysis-dependent patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) is reviewed. SUMMARY: Although erythropoiesis-stimulating 
      agents (ESAs) are the mainstay of anemia treatment, concomitant iron 
      supplementation is often required. Patients with CKD are at risk for developing 
      iron deficiency due to frequent blood testing, decreased dietary intake, 
      inflammation, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, the use of phosphate 
      binders, hemodialysis, and treatment with ESAs. Seven randomized, controlled 
      trials compared i.v. and oral iron in this population, six in patients treated 
      with ESAs and one in patients not receiving ESAs. Two studies found no difference 
      between i.v. and oral iron. An additional study found the two formulations to be 
      equivalent when evaluating ESA dosage requirements. All studies found i.v. iron 
      to be superior in increasing ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. 
      Five of the studies compared baseline laboratory values for patients treated with 
      i.v. and oral iron; all of these found oral iron to significantly increase 
      hemoglobin, ferritin, or TSAT levels. Only one trial found a significant decrease 
      from baseline in ferritin and TSAT for oral iron. Interpretation of the results 
      of these studies is limited by several factors, the most significant of which is 
      a short study duration, ranging from 21 days to six months. CONCLUSION: Published 
      evidence does not support the use of i.v. iron over oral iron to treat 
      deficiencies in non-hemodialysis-dependent patients with CKD. While studies found 
      that i.v. iron significantly increased serum levels of ferritin and TSAT, 
      hemoglobin levels were not consistently raised.

TI  - Increased NGAL level associated with iron store in chronic kidney disease with 
      anemia.
PG  - 563-568
LID - 10.1007/s10238-018-0507-4 [doi]
AB  - An iron scarcity often occurs in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Neutrophil 
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a biomarker of acute kidney injury, is 
      associated with iron metabolism. The present study determined the association 
      between serum NGAL and iron status in chronic kidney disease with anemia. A total 
      of 154 adult CKD patients were divided into anemia and without anemia groups. The 
      anemia groups were further subdivided into two groups based on the presence or 
      absence of iron deficiency, defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. The 
      NGAL was measured for all the 154 patients, and the possible relationships with 
      iron status were analyzed. 27.7% patients with TSAT < 20% presented lower 
      hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, and higher NGAL values than those without 
      iron deficiency. NGAL was inversely correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, 
      MCH, serum iron, and TSAT. NGAL adequately diagnosed the status of iron 
      deficiency among CKD patients by ROC analysis. The optimal NGAL cutoff value able 
      to identify iron deficiency was found to be > 244.8 ng/mL, with 73.01% 
      sensitivity and 68.29% specificity. CKD patients with anemia presented altered 
      NGAL values as this protein is involved in the maintenance of iron balance. Thus, 
      NGAL might be proposed as a new tool for assessing the iron deficiency and in the 
      management of iron therapy for CKD patients.

TI  - Pumping iron: revisiting risks, benefits and strategies in treatment of iron 
      deficiency in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 188-94
AB  - Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia in patients with end stage renal 
      disease (ESRD). Intravenous iron administration, especially in those requiring 
      treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) is an essential component 
      of the management of anemia in ESRD patients. Iron improves hemoglobin, reduces 
      ESA dose requirement and also has nonerythropoietic effects including improvement 
      in physical performance, cognition and amelioration of restless leg syndrome. 
      However, iron can promote oxidative stress, cause endothelial dysfunction, 
      inflammation and tissue injury, and has a potential to cause progression of both 
      CKD and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we discuss the benefits and risks 
      associated with i.v. iron and the practical aspects of iron administration that 
      can minimize the complications related to iron therapy in ESRD.

AB  - Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with poor overall outcome if 
      not promptly managed with erythropoietin when indicated. This study assessed iron 
      status and associated factors in predialysis CKD patients in Southern Nigeria. 
      This was a cross-sectional study that assessed and compared iron status in 100 
      predialysis CKD patients and 90 healthy controls. Mean age of the CKD patients 
      was 49.39 ± 14.84 years. Iron deficiency was present in 14% of CKD patients 
      compared to 3% of the controls (P = 0.021). Among CKD patients with ID, 11 
      (85.7%) had functional iron deficiency while three (14.3%) had absolute iron 
      deficiency. Serum ferritin was significantly higher in the predialysis CKD 
      patients (P = 0.001). There was no significant gender difference in iron indices 
      among the CKD patients. Functional iron deficiency was present in 11 (11%) of the 
      CKD patients compared to none among the control group (P = 0.003). There was no 
      significant association between iron deficiency and age, gender, etiology, and 
      stage of CKD. Functional iron deficiency was the predominant form of iron 
      deficiency in our predialysis CKD patients, and there was no significant 
      association with age, gender, stage, or etiology of CKD.

TI  - Iron-based phosphorus chelator: Risk of iron deposition and action on bone 
      metabolism in uremic rats.
PG  - 446-452
LID - 10.1177/15353702211057280 [doi]
AB  - Phosphate chelators are frequently used in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). New iron-based chelators remain understudied and offer a promising 
      therapeutic option for the control of bone and mineral disorders of chronic 
      kidney disease (BMD-CKD). We assessed the effect of the phosphorus chelator, 
      chitosan-iron III (CH-FeCl), compared to calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) in BMD-CKD 
      and the potential iron overload in uremic rats. Thirty-two animals were divided 
      into four groups, namely the control, CKD, CKD/CH-FeCl, and CKD/CaCO(3) groups. 
      CKD was induced by adding 0.75% (4 weeks) and 0.1% (3 weeks) adenine to the diet. 
      The chelators were administered from week 3 through week 7. The renal function, 
      BMD-CKD markers, and histomorphometry of the femur were assessed at week 7. The 
      CKD group showed a significant increase in creatinine (83.9 ± 18.6 vs. 
      41.5 ± 22.1 µmol/L; P = 0.001), phosphate (3.5 ± 0.8 vs. 2.2 ± 0.2 mmol/L; 
      P = 0.001), fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEP) (0.71 ± 0.2 vs. 0.2 ± 0.17; 
      P = 0.0001), and FGF23 (81.36 ± 37.16 pg/mL vs. 7.42 ± 1.96; P = 0.011) compared 
      to the control group. There was no accumulation of serum or bone iron after the 
      use of CH-FeCl. The use of chelators reduced the FEP (control: 0.71 ± 0.20; 
      CKD/CH-FeCl: 0.40 ± 0.16; CKD/CaCO(3) 0.34 ± 0.15; P = 0.001), without changes in 
      the serum FGF23 and parathyroid hormone levels. Histomorphometry revealed the 
      presence of bone disease with high remodeling in the uremic animals without 
      changes with the use of chelators. The CH-FeCl chelator was efficient in reducing 
      the FEP without iron accumulation, thereby paving the way for the use of this 
      class of chelators in clinical settings in the future.

      Kidney Disease.
PG  - 572-581
LID - 10.1159/000516012 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ferric citrate (FC) is indicated as an oral iron replacement for 
      iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on 
      dialysis. The recommended starting dose is one 1-g tablet three times daily 
      (TID). This study investigated long-term efficacy and safety of different FC 
      dosing regimens for treating anemia in nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD). 
      METHODS: In this phase 4, randomized, open-label, multicenter study, patients 
      with anemia with NDD-CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate, ≥20 mL/min and 
      <60 mL/min) were randomized 1:1 to one FC tablet (1-g equivalent to 210 mg ferric 
      iron) TID (3 g/day) or 2 tablets twice daily (BID; 4 g/day). At week 12, dosage 
      was increased to 2 tablets TID (6 g/day) or 3 tablets BID (6 g/day) in patients 
      whose hemoglobin (Hb) levels increased <0.5 g/dL or were <10 g/dL. Primary 
      endpoint was mean change in Hb from baseline to week 24. RESULTS: Of 484 patients 
      screened, 206 were randomized and 205 received FC. Mean (standard deviation) 
      changes from baseline in Hb at week 24 were 0.77 (0.84) g/dL with FC TID 3 g/day 
      and 0.70 (0.98) g/dL with FC BID 4 g/day. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: FC administered 
      BID and TID for 48 weeks was safe and effective for treating anemia in this 
      population, supporting potentially increased dosing flexibility.

TI  - Intravenous iron supplementation in the anaemia of renal and cardiac failure--a 
      double-edged sword?
PG  - vii16-23
AB  - The anaemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is efficiently corrected with a 
      combination of recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) and intravenous iron 
      supplementation. Recently, patients with severe cardiac failure and anaemia have 
      also been shown to benefit from this treatment. However, iron excess may lead to 
      the production of free radicals and has been incriminated in the pathogenesis of 
      atherosclerosis and increased risk of infection, the two major causes of death in 
      end-stage renal disease. The exact risk of excess iron supplementation has not 
      been defined and, in the absence of sensitive and specific indicators of iron 
      overload, the risk remains difficult to quantify. There is increasing 
      epidemiological evidence incriminating iron overload as a risk factor in CKD, but 
      direct evidence is still hard to obtain. The precise role of iron is complicated 
      further by the complex inter-relationships between iron metabolism and the 
      inflammatory process characteristic of CKD. The recent discovery of the 
      antimicrobial peptide, hepcidin, may shed light on these inter-relationships. New 
      methods for quantifying non-transferrin-bound (or labile plasma) iron may help in 
      the future to identify patients at risk for toxicity from excess iron 
      supplementation.

TI  - Narrative Review of Hyperferritinemia, Iron Deficiency, and the Challenges of 
      Managing Anemia in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians With CKD.
PG  - 501-512

AB  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians (Indigenous Australians) suffer 
      some of the highest rates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the world. Among 
      Indigenous Australians in remote areas of the Northern Territory, prevalence 
      rates for renal replacement therapy (RRT) are up to 30 times higher than national 
      prevalence. Anemia among patients with CKD is a common complication. Iron 
      deficiency is one of the major causes. Iron deficiency is also one of the key 
      causes of poor response to the mainstay of anemia therapy with 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Therefore, the effective management of 
      anemia in people with CKD is largely dependent on effective identification and 
      correction of iron deficiency. The current identification of iron deficiency in 
      routine clinical practice is dependent on 2 surrogate markers of iron status: 
      serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation (TSAT). However, 
      questions exist regarding the use of serum ferritin concentration in people with 
      CKD because it is an acute-phase reactant that can be raised in the context of 
      acute and chronic inflammation. Serum ferritin concentration among Indigenous 
      Australians receiving RRT is often markedly elevated and falls outside reference 
      ranges within most national and international guidelines for iron therapy for 
      people with CKD. This review explores published data on the challenges of 
      managing anemia in Indigenous people with CKD and the need for future research on 
      the efficacy and safety of treatment of anemia of CKD in patients with high 
      ferritin and evidence iron deficiency.

      chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Anemia is a very common clinical problem in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. 
      Erythropoietin is a hormone synthesized that is deficient in the majority of 
      patients with advanced kidney disease, thereby predisposing these patients to 
      anemia. The other cause of anemia is deficiency of iron. Iron deficiency anemia 
      is common in people with CKD and its importance in supporting erythropoiesis is 
      unquestioned, especially in those patients treated with erythropoietin. 
      Intravenous iron is frequently used to treat anemia in CKD patients and is very 
      efficacious in increasing hemoglobin but at the same time there are some safety 
      issues associated with it. The objective of this review is to assess the 
      frequency of adverse drug events associated with four different iron 
      formulations: two iron dextran products known as high and low molecular weight 
      iron dextran, iron sucrose, and sodium ferric gluconate complex. Several 
      electronic databases were searched. In general, with the exception of high 
      molecular weight iron dextran, serious or life-threatening adverse events 
      appeared rare. Iron sucrose has the least reported adverse events and high 
      molecular weight iron dextran has the highest number of reported adverse events. 
      Low molecular weight iron dextran and ferric gluconate fall in between these two 
      for number of adverse drug events.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: For investigating the efficacy and mechanism of Roxadustat + oral iron 
      in the treatment of elderly chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicated with anemia. 
      METHODS: A total of 100 elderly patients with CKD and anemia admitted to our 
      hospital between April 2020 and December 2021 were enrolled as research subjects, 
      and the patients were assigned to control group (Con group, n = 50) or 
      experimental group (Exp group, n = 50). The patients in the Con group were given 
      oral iron, and those in the Exp group were given Roxadustat capsule based on the 
      Con group. Both groups were given subcutaneous injection of recombinant human 
      erythropoietin. The clinical efficacy, anemia indexes, iron metabolism indexes, 
      inflammatory indexes, and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: The Exp group showed a notably higher treatment effective rate than the 
      Con group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the anemia indexes, iron metabolism 
      indexes, and inflammatory indexes in the Exp group were notably better than those 
      in the Con group (P < 0.05). The Exp group showed a notably lower incidence of 
      adverse reactions during treatment than the Con group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      Roxadustat plus oral iron yields a pronounced clinical efficacy in the therapy of 
      elderly patients with CKD and anemia.

TI  - Iron status and chronic kidney disease predict restless legs syndrome in an older 
      hospital population.
PG  - 295-301
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2010.08.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is important in the pathogenesis of restless legs 
      syndrome (RLS), and serum ferritin measurement, using a cutoff of 45-50ng/ml, is 
      widely recommended as the optimal screening test for iron deficiency in RLS. 
      Serum ferritin often increases with inflammation, and a higher cutoff may be 
      better in those with acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, including those 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: The relationships between RLS and 
      potential secondary causes were examined in hospital patients aged 50years or 
      more. Diagnosis of RLS was based on a clinician interview. RESULTS: Of 301 
      patients, 55 (18.3%) had RLS. Ferritin levels less than 40ng/ml and between 40 
      and 69ng/ml and Stage 4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] between 
      15 and 29ml/min and not on dialysis) were associated with significantly higher 
      odds for RLS in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency 
      and chronic kidney disease are the strongest predictors of RLS in older hospital 
      patients. Ferritin less than 70ng/ml is the best cutoff for identifying possible 
      iron deficiency in RLS patients with inflammatory conditions. Independent of iron 
      status, RLS is strongly associated with chronic kidney disease that is not severe 
      enough to require dialysis, and the results of this study suggest that eGFR 
      values and stages of CKD should be reported in future studies of RLS.

AB  - Iron is suggested to play a detrimental role in the progression of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). The kidney recycles iron back into the circulation. However, the 
      localization of proteins relevant for physiological tubular iron handling and 
      their potential role in CKD remain unclear. We examined associations between iron 
      deposition, expression of iron handling proteins and tubular injury in kidney 
      biopsies from CKD patients and healthy controls using immunohistochemistry. Iron 
      was deposited in proximal (PT) and distal tubules (DT) in 33% of CKD biopsies, 
      predominantly in pathologies with glomerular dysfunction, but absent in controls. 
      In healthy kidney, PT contained proteins required for iron recycling including 
      putative iron importers ZIP8, ZIP14, DMT1, iron storage proteins L- and 
      H-ferritin and iron exporter ferroportin, while DT only contained ZIP8, ZIP14, 
      and DMT1. In CKD, iron deposition associated with increased intensity of iron 
      importers (ZIP14, ZIP8), storage proteins (L-, H-ferritin), and/or decreased 
      ferroportin abundance. This demonstrates that tubular iron accumulation may 
      result from increased iron uptake and/or inadequate iron export. Iron deposition 
      associated with oxidative injury as indicated by heme oxygenase-1 abundance. In 
      conclusion, iron deposition is relatively common in CKD, and may result from 
      altered molecular iron handling and may contribute to renal injury.

TI  - A randomized trial of intravenous and oral iron in chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Although iron is commonly used to correct iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), its effect on kidney function is unclear. To assess this, 
      we randomly assigned patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD and IDA to either open-label 
      oral ferrous sulfate (69 patients to 325 mg three times daily for 8 weeks) or 
      intravenous iron sucrose (67 patients to 200 mg every 2 weeks, total 1 g). The 
      primary outcome was the between-group difference in slope of measured glomerular 
      filtration rate (mGFR) change over two years. The trial was terminated early on 
      the recommendation of an independent data and safety monitoring board based on 
      little chance of finding differences in mGFR slopes, but a higher risk of serious 
      adverse events in the intravenous iron treatment group. mGFR declined similarly 
      over two years in both treatment groups (oral -3.6 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), 
      intravenous -4.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), between-group difference -0.35 ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2); 95% confidence interval -2.9 to 2.3). There were 36 serious 
      cardiovascular events among 19 participants assigned to the oral iron treatment 
      group and 55 events among 17 participants of the intravenous iron group (adjusted 
      incidence rate ratio 2.51 (1.56-4.04)). Infections resulting in hospitalizations 
      had a significant adjusted incidence rate ratio of 2.12 (1.24-3.64). Thus, among 
      non-dialyzed patients with CKD and IDA, intravenous iron therapy is associated 
      with an increased risk of serious adverse events, including those from 
      cardiovascular causes and infectious diseases.

TI  - Nonhematological benefits of iron.
PG  - 565-71
AB  - Iron deficiency anemia is common in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      its importance in supporting erythropoiesis is unquestioned especially in those 
      patients treated with erythropoietin. Clinical symptomatology such as 
      fatigability, cold intolerance, failure to concentrate and poor effort 
      intolerance is often attributed to anemia or uremia. That iron deficiency, per 
      se, can cause these symptoms is poorly recognized. Clinical and animal studies 
      that support the benefits of iron supplementation, independent of increasing 
      hemoglobin, such as those on immune function, physical performance, 
      thermoregulation, cognition, and restless leg syndrome and aluminum absorption is 
      the subject of this narrative review.

LID - 10.1038/sj.ki.5002779 [doi]
AB  - Serious adverse events that occur with the administration of iron dextran are due 
      to the high molecular weight preparations. Conclusions that iron sucrose and 
      ferric gluconate are safer than iron dextran may be premature. Published 
      literature comparing safety profiles of available parenteral iron products is 
      reviewed. Administration of iron salts to pre-dialysis patients with chronic 
      kidney disease may not be optimal. We recommend the total dose infusion of low 
      molecular weight iron dextran as an option for iron replacement.

TI  - Considerations for optimal iron use for anemia due to chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1637-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Availability of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has 
      improved the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron 
      deficiency is the most common cause of resistance to rHuEPO therapy, contributing 
      to ineffective erythropoiesis and hematocrit/hemoglobin values below the 
      recommended target range (33%-36%/11-12 g/dL). I.v. iron supplementation is 
      necessary to meet increased iron demands from stimulation of erythropoiesis and 
      chronic blood loss; however, questions remain as to the optimal supplementation 
      strategy to maintain appropriate yet safe iron status. Treatment guidelines for 
      anemia management have been developed through the National Kidney Foundation 
      Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI). OBJECTIVE: This review 
      presents the basis of need for the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines and includes detailed 
      information concerning iron physiology, metabolism, iron preparations, and 
      evaluation of iron status. METHODS: This review was based on a MEDLINE search and 
      complemented by references from the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines (whose review extended 
      beyond MEDLINE). References focusing on normal iron physiology and metabolism, 
      alterations in iron physiology in patients with CKD, laboratory evaluation 
      methods, and strategies for iron supplementation were obtained from MEDLINE and 
      reviewed for content. RESULTS: Controversy over appropriate use of iron 
      supplementation has led to disparity in accepted practice procedures. Oral iron 
      (ferrous salts and polysaccharide iron complex) and i.v. iron preparations (iron 
      dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, and iron sucrose) are available. Problems with 
      oral iron supplementation include limited absorption and patient noncompliance. 
      Although most available data on i.v. iron use in the United States are specific 
      to iron dextran preparations, published information based on clinical use of 
      sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose products has been promising. The use of 
      chronic i.v. iron administration to sustain iron stores has been more widely 
      accepted to prevent development of absolute and functional iron deficiency. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although iron therapy is commonly warranted in patients with CKD, 
      questions remain as to the most favorable supplementation strategy to optimize 
      therapy through improvements in hematocrits, efficient use of rHuEPO, and 
      maintenance of appropriate and safe iron levels. Clinicians will need to devise 
      strategies based on the compilation of information from clinical experience and 
      the available literature. Clinical practice guidelines devised by the NKF-K/DOQI 
      have provided a useful tool for the medical community using both these resources.

TI  - Iron Indices in Patients with Functional Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 129-36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite high ferritin level, HDCKD patients may have functional iron 
      deficiency even after intravenous iron (iv) therapy. The aim of this study was to 
      test the hypothesis that lowered serum transferrin level may contribute to 
      functional anemia and erythropoietin hypo responsiveness by the failure to 
      transport accumulated tissue iron to the relevant target tissue. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The study subjects were divided into four groups. Group-A: HDCKD 
      Patients receiving iv iron (n=290). Group-B: Patients not initiated on to 
      hemodialysis (NDCKD), and received oral iron (n=38). Group-C: HDCKD patients with 
      erythropoietin hypo responsiveness (n=9). Group-D: Healthy controls (n=36). The 
      group-A, patients were sub-divided into five groups (A-1 to A-5) based on their 
      serum ferritin levels. RESULTS: Serum ferritin and tissue iron levels in group-A 
      and C patients were significantly greater than the group-D(p<0.0001) and group-B 
      patients(p<0.001). Transferrin level of group-A and C showed lowered values and 
      consequently a higher %TSAT when compared to group-D. The percent of patients 
      with iron overload was 2.6%, 31%, and 44% in group-B, group-A and group-C 
      respectively. Serum transferrin level significantly correlated with TIBC in 
      group-A and B patients (p<0.0001;p<0.05 respectively). Transferrin level 
      significantly correlated with TIBC in all subgroups of HDCKD(p<0.05) with the 
      exception in subgroup-A2 and with hemoglobin in subgroups A3 (p<0.05) and 
      A5(p<0.01) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lowered transferrin level prevents the 
      proper transport of the iron to the hematopoietic sites, which may be a reason 
      for the low hemoglobin synthesis and also for the development of erythropoietin 
      hypo responsiveness in some of the dialysis patients.

TI  - Iron indices in chronic kidney disease in the National Health and Nutritional 
      Examination Survey 1988-2004.
PG  - 57-61

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Anemia is a common and early complication of 
      nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). One contributing factor is iron 
      deficiency, which may be particularly problematic during erythropoietin 
      replacement therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of iron 
      deficiency in nondialysis CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The 
      National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) data for NHANES III 
      (1988 to 1994) and subsequent NHANES 2-yr datasets, 1999 to 2000, 2001 to 2002, 
      and 2003 to 2004 were analyzed for individuals >18 yr old. RESULTS: It was found 
      that low levels of iron tests [either serum ferritin < 100 ng/ml or transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT) < 20%] were present in most patients with reduced creatinine 
      clearance (CrCl). The percentage of low iron tests was higher among women than 
      men, present in 57.8 to 58.8% of men and 69.9 to 72.8% of women (P < 0.001). With 
      declining levels of CrCl, in women, TSAT levels decreased, whereas, surprisingly, 
      serum ferritin tended to progressively increase. The percentage of anemic 
      subjects increased progressively with declining quartiles of TSAT but was 
      unrelated to serum ferritin quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that low levels 
      of iron tests, following National Kidney Foundation/Kidney Disease Outcomes 
      Quality Initiative guidelines (either serum ferritin < 100 ng/ml or TSAT < 20%) 
      were present in most patients with reduced CrCl.

AB  - Disordered iron and mineral homeostasis are interrelated complications of chronic 
      kidney disease that may influence cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. In a 
      prospective analysis of 3747 participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency 
      Cohort Study, we investigated risks of mortality, heart failure, end-stage kidney 
      disease (ESKD), and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease according to iron 
      status, and tested for mediation by C-terminal fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF23), hemoglobin and parathyroid hormone. Study participants were agnostically 
      categorized based on quartiles of transferrin saturation and ferritin as "Iron 
      Replete" (27.1% of participants; referent group for all outcomes analyses), "Iron 
      Deficiency" (11.1%), "Functional Iron Deficiency" (7.6%), "Mixed Iron Deficiency" 
      (iron indices between the Iron Deficiency and Functional Iron Deficiency groups; 
      6.3%), "High Iron" (9.2%), or "Non-Classified" (the remaining 38.8% of 
      participants). In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, Iron Deficiency 
      independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence 
      interval 1.04-1.58) and heart failure (1.34, 1.05- 1.72). Mixed Iron Deficiency 
      associated with mortality (1.61, 1.27-2.04) and ESKD (1.33, 1.02-1.73). High Iron 
      associated with mortality (1.54, 1.24-1.91), heart failure (1.58, 1.21-2.05), and 
      ESKD (1.41, 1.13-1.77). Functional Iron Deficiency did not significantly 
      associate with any outcome, and no iron group significantly associated with 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Among the candidate mediators, FGF23 most 
      significantly mediated the risks of mortality and heart failure conferred by Iron 
      Deficiency. Thus, alterations in iron homeostasis associated with adverse 
      cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.

LID - 10.5301/jn.5000025 [doi]
AB  - Ferumoxytol is a new product approved for intravenous use by the US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults with 
      chronic kidney disease. This approval was based on data from 3 open-label, 
      randomized, controlled clinical trials. In all of these trials, ferumoxytol was 
      well tolerated, and hemoglobin levels were significantly increased compared with 
      those achieved by orally administered iron. Ferumoxytol, a superparamagnetic iron 
      oxide coated with a carbohydrate shell, is also used as a magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) agent due to its magnetic properties. In addition, it has 
      demonstrated a greater T1 relaxation time than MRI gadolinium-contrast agents. 
      Currently, the Ferumoxytol Compared to Iron Sucrose Trial (FIRST) has started. 
      This is a multicenter randomized trial of ferumoxytol compared with iron sucrose 
      for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult subjects with chronic kidney 
      disease, where intravenous ferumoxytol is being compared with other intravenous 
      agents to evaluate the safety of ferumoxytol and assess changes in hemoglobin 
      level.

TI  - Iron-based phosphate binders: a paradigm shift in the treatment of 
      hyperphosphatemic anemic CKD patients?
PG  - 755-765
LID - 10.1007/s40620-017-0421-y [doi]
AB  - The partial correction of anemia and the normalization of phosphate and blood 
      pressure are the mainstay of treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). Available anti-hypertensive drugs, erythropoiesis stimulating agents 
      (ESAs) and iron supplements have resolved quite satisfactorily the goal of 
      controlling hypertension and partially correcting anemia. Unfortunately, the 
      treatment of hyperphosphatemia is still far from resolved. Phosphate binders have 
      poor tolerability and/or limited efficacy, leading to the prescription of many 
      tablets that achieve only a mild-to-moderate effect. Moreover, increased 
      consumption of tablets is associated with increased low tolerability, thus 
      jeopardizing patient compliance and, in turn, the efficacy of phosphate binding. 
      Compared to calcium-free binders, the cheaper calcium salts increase the risk of 
      hypercalcemia, calciphylaxis and vascular calcification and possibly all-cause 
      mortality. Calcium-free phosphate binders decrease serum phosphate levels without 
      increasing the serum calcium concentration. The higher phosphate-binding efficacy 
      of lanthanum carbonate compared to sevelamer should be balanced against its lack 
      of pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism and inflammation and the accumulation 
      in bones. New iron-based phosphate binders are available. In addition to their 
      phosphate binding capacity, they could also be useful to treat anemia. Iron 
      citrate is seeking for such an indication because its iron absorption is 
      significant. This could be of clinical importance, particularly in CKD patients 
      not on dialysis, obviating the need for extra oral iron administration and 
      possibly favoring compliance. In conclusion, the use of iron-based phosphate 
      binders with significant iron absorption properties could represent a novel 
      paradigm for correcting anemia and hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients.

TI  - Prevalence, correlates and outcomes of absolute and functional iron deficiency 
      anemia in nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 129-136
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfz192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in those with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). We examined the association of absolute and functional iron 
      deficiency anemia (IDA) with adverse outcomes (cardiovascular hospitalization, 
      dialysis and mortality) in those with nondialysis-dependent CKD. METHODS: 
      Nondialysis-dependent CKD patients followed in the US Veterans Administration 
      with hemoglobin level measured within 90 days of the date of the second estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included. Logistic regression, 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models adjusted for 
      demographics and comorbidities were used to assess the prevalence and correlates 
      of absolute [transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤20%, ferritin <100 ng/mL] and 
      functional (TSA T≤20%, ferritin >100-500 ng/mL) IDA and the associations of 
      absolute and functional IDA with mortality, dialysis and cardiovascular 
      hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 933 463 patients with CKD, 20.6% had anemia. Among 
      those with anemia, 23.6% of patients had both TSAT and ferritin level measured, 
      of whom 30% had absolute IDA and 19% had functional IDA. Absolute IDA in CKD was 
      not associated with an increased risk of mortality or dialysis but was associated 
      with a higher risk of 1-year {risk ratio [RR] 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.12-1.28]} and 2-year cardiovascular hospitalization [RR 1.11 (95% CI 
      1.05-1.17)]. CKD patients with functional IDA had a higher risk of mortality 
      [hazard ratio (HR) 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.14)] along with a higher risk of 1-year 
      [RR 1.21 (95% CI 1.1-1.30)] and 2-year cardiovascular hospitalization [RR 1.13 
      (95% CI 1.07-1.21)]. Ferritin >500 ng/mL (treated as a separate category) was 
      only associated with an increased risk of mortality [HR 1.38 (95% CI 1.26-1.51)]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a large population of CKD patients with anemia, absolute and 
      functional IDA were associated with various clinical covariates. Functional IDA 
      was associated with an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular 
      hospitalization, but absolute IDA was associated only with a higher risk of 
      hospitalization.

TI  - Iron management in nondialysis-dependent CKD.
PG  - 736-43
AB  - Iron deficiency has been studied extensively in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease on hemodialysis therapy. However, few studies looked at iron treatment in 
      the nondialysis chronic kidney disease population. Limited data suggest that iron 
      deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney disease with anemia; this 
      lack of iron can hinder the effectiveness of erythropoiesis. The diagnosis of 
      iron deficiency should involve clinical judgment, with an emphasis on clinical 
      characteristics of the patient because of the limited amount of literature 
      examining the interpretation of iron testing results. When iron deficiency is 
      diagnosed in nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, a search must be 
      initiated for any sources of blood loss. After addressing any blood loss, the 
      preferred route of iron treatment must be determined. To date, no clear advantage 
      was shown with intravenous versus oral administration in nondialysis patients, as 
      shown in the hemodialysis setting. Thus, oral iron therapy may be a more 
      reasonable option unless oral therapy previously failed. Additional research is 
      needed to support evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of iron deficiency 
      in the nondialysis chronic kidney disease population because this population 
      differs from hemodialysis patients in the decreased extent of blood loss.

TI  - Association between serum iron markers, iron supplementation, and cardiovascular 
      morbidity in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease.
LID - gfad096 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfad096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal range of serum iron markers and usefulness of iron 
      supplementation are uncertain in patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). We investigated the association between serum iron indices and 
      risk of cardiovascular disease events and the effectiveness of iron 
      supplementation using CKD-Japan Cohort data. METHODS: We included 1 416 patients 
      aged 20-75 years with pre-dialysis CKD. The tested exposures were serum 
      transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels, and the outcome measures were 
      any cardiovascular event. Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models were used to 
      examine the association between serum iron indices and time to events. The 
      multivariable fractional polynomial interaction approach was used to evaluate 
      whether serum iron indices were effect modifiers of the association between iron 
      supplementation and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of 
      cardiovascular disease events for a median of 4.12 years was 26.7 events/1 000 
      person-years. Patients with serum transferrin saturation < 20% demonstrated an 
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease (sub-distribution hazard ratio: 2.13) 
      and congestive heart failure (sub-distribution hazard ratio: 2.42). The magnitude 
      of reduction in cardiovascular disease risk with iron supplementation was greater 
      in patients with lower transferrin saturations (p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Maintaining transferrin saturation > 20% and adequate iron supplementation may 
      effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events in patients with 
      pre-dialysis CKD.

TI  - Ferric Maltol: A New Oral Iron Formulation for the Treatment of Iron Deficiency 
      in Adults.
PG  - 222-229
LID - 10.1177/1060028020941014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ferric maltol 
      (FM), an oral iron formulation, for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). DATA SOURCES: A 
      MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE (January 1, 1985, to June 19, 2020) literature search 
      was performed using the terms ferric maltol, accrufer, feraccru, iron maltol, 
      ferric trimaltol, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, inflammatory bowel 
      disease, and chronic kidney disease. Additional data sources included prescribing 
      information, abstracts, and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials 
      Registry. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: English language literature evaluating 
      FM pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in the treatment of IDA 
      were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: FM is a ferric, non-salt-based oral iron 
      formulation demonstrating improved tolerance in patients with previous 
      intolerance to other iron formulations. Phase 3 trials demonstrated significant 
      improvements in anemia and serum iron parameters in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Common adverse effects were 
      gastrointestinal intolerance. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: FM 
      is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to oral iron salts for patients 
      with IBD or CKD and IDA. Emerging data suggest that FM is noninferior to 
      intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose in patients with IBD and IDA. Prior to 
      selecting FM over IV iron products, consideration should be given to time to 
      normalization of Hb, ease of administration, cost, and tolerability. CONCLUSION: 
      FM is a relatively safe, effective oral iron therapy that may be better tolerated 
      than other oral iron formulations. FM may be an effective alternative to IV iron 
      in patients with IBD.

LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfad190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral iron is the predominant route of iron replacement (IRT) but its 
      benefits and safety are unclear in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      METHODS: We examined the association of oral IRT vs no IRT with end-stage kidney 
      disease (ESKD) and mortality in a national cohort of US Veterans. We identified 
      17 413 incident new users of oral IRT with estimated glomerular filtration rates 
      <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 32 530 controls who did not receive any IRT during 
      2004-18. We used propensity score-overlap weighting to account for differences in 
      key baseline characteristics associated with the use of oral IRT. We examined 
      associations using competing risk regression and Cox models. RESULTS: In the 
      cohort of 49 943 patients, 1616 (3.2%) patients experienced ESKD and 28 711 (57%) 
      patients died during a median follow-up of 1.9 years. Oral IRT was not associated 
      with ESKD [subhazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval, CI) 1.00 (0.84-1.19), 
      P = .9] and was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR (95% CI) 
      1.06 (1.01-1.11), P = .01]. There was significant heterogeneity of treatment 
      effect for mortality, with oral IRT associated with higher mortality in the 
      subgroups of patients without congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia or iron 
      deficiency. In patient with blood hemoglobin <10 g/dL oral IRT was associated 
      with significantly lower mortality. CONCLUSION: Oral IRT was associated with 
      lower mortality only in patients with anemia. In patients without anemia, iron 
      deficiency or CHF, the risk-benefit ratio of oral IRT should be further examined.

TI  - Evaluation of Iron Status by Reticulocyte Haemoglobin Content (Chr) in Chronic

AB  - Diagnosing iron deficiency with currently available tests is difficult in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the inflammatory state 
      associated with uraemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of 
      reticulocyte haemoglobin (CHr) as a diagnostic tool of iron deficiency and a 
      predictor to intravenous iron therapy in a cohort of CKD patients on 
      haemodialysis in Sri Lanka. This was a descriptive cross sectional study 
      involving hundred (100) patients with CKD on regular haemodialysis and 
      erythropoietin. Patients were categorised into groups depending on serum 
      ferritin, transferrin saturation and reticulocyte haemoglobin (CHr). All patients 
      with CHr < 29 pg were treated with a single dose of intravenous(IV) iron 500 mg. 
      The CHr was measured 72 h after the IV iron treatment to assess the response. 
      Within the population mean haemoglobin was 9.27 g/dL, mean serum ferritin was 
      243.5 ng/mL, mean transferrin saturation was 18.6% and mean CHr was 29.2 pg. 
      Thirty three of the 100 patients (33%) were subjected to IV iron therapy and 
      there was a significant increase of CHr 72 h after IV iron treatment (p < 0.001). 
      As a diagnostic tool in iron deficiency in CKD patients on haemodialysis, CHr 
      showed a sensitivity of 56%, specificity of 73% and positive predictive value of 
      84%. Reticulocyte haemoglobin (CHr) can be used as an early predictor of response 
      to IV iron therapy. However, further evaluation is necessary to consider CHr as a 
      diagnostic tool to detect iron deficiency in CKD patients on haemodialysis.

TI  - Proteinuria induced by parenteral iron in chronic kidney disease--a comparative 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 114-21
LID - 10.2215/CJN.06020710 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      differences in proteinuria are seen between intravenous iron preparations after a 
      single dose exposure. This study examined differences in proteinuria between two 
      intravenous iron preparations after multiple doses. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients with iron-deficiency anemia and CKD, 
      stratified by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin 
      receptor-blocker (ARB) use, were randomized to iron sucrose or ferric gluconate. 
      Each patient at 12 centers received 100 mg of study drug weekly for 5 weeks. 
      Urine protein/urine creatinine ratio was measured before each dose and frequently 
      thereafter for 3 hours. RESULTS: Postbaseline data were available from 33 
      patients receiving iron sucrose and 29 patients receiving ferric gluconate. 
      Although neither preparation of intravenous iron increased the predose level of 
      proteinuria, the proteinuric response to intravenous iron was dependent on the 
      type of iron and ACEI/ARB use. Without ACEIs/ARBs, ferric gluconate tended to 
      cause less proteinuria with repeated iron administration; iron sucrose did not 
      mitigate or aggravate proteinuria. Among patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs, in 
      contrast to ferric gluconate, which produced only mild transient proteinuria, 
      iron sucrose produced a consistent and persistent proteinuric response that was 
      on average 78% greater. CONCLUSIONS: Although multiple doses of either 
      intravenous iron did not increase basal levels of proteinuria, postdose 
      proteinuria was greater with iron sucrose than with ferric gluconate. These data 
      suggest that nephrotoxicity of iron may depend on type of intravenous iron and on 
      ACEI/ARB use. The long-term effects on kidney function need to be further 
      evaluated.

TI  - [Iron deficiency in ND-CKD: from diagnosis to treatment].
PG  - 50-61
AB  - In non-dialysis-chronic kidney disease (CKD), iron deficiency is a frequent 
      nutritional disorder due to either the greater tendency to occult 
      gastrointestinal bleeding or to the chronic inflammatory state resulting in a 
      reduced intestinal iron reabsorption through an increased synthesis of hepcidin. 
      These phenomenon are responsible for a negative iron balance that compromises 
      erythropoiesis and contributes to the pathogenesis of anemia in CKD. Several 
      laboratory tests are now available to allow an adequate diagnosis of iron 
      deficiency. Among the new parameters, the percentage of hypochromic red cells (% 
      HYPO) and the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) are now considered as the 
      most specific markers for diagnosing iron-deficiency erythropoiesis. 
      Unfortunately, their implementation in clinical practice is limited by the scarce 
      availability. In non-dialyzed CKD , subjects intolerant or non-responsive to oral 
      iron therapy, can be effectively treated with novel intravenous iron 
      preparations, such as iron carboxymaltose, that allow a complete and rapid 
      correction of iron deficient anemia. Furthermore, this iron compound is 
      associated with lower rate of adverse effects since the carbohydrate shell 
      (carboxymaltose) is more stable than gluconate and saccarate thus reducing the 
      release of free iron in the bloodstream. Of note, the possibility of 
      administering this drug at high doses and reduced frequency decreases the risk of 
      infusion reactions. Finally, a substantial economic saving mainly dependent on a 
      reduction in indirect costs represents a further advantage in the use of iron 
      carboxymaltose in this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is common in patients with end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD). Platelet count changes may reflect iron status, but the relationship 
      between platelet count and iron indices is unclear in patients with ESRD. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 1,167 patients with ESRD from 2012 
      to 2017 in West China Hospital. Baseline data were used to analyze the 
      relationship between the platelet count and iron indices. Patients were followed 
      up for 3 years. RESULTS: Patients with iron deficiency (both absolute and 
      functional) had a higher platelet count than those without iron deficiency 
      (174 ± 61 × 10(9)/L vs. 153 ± 58 × 10(9)/L, P < .001). Receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis showed a weak predictive power of platelet count on 
      absolute iron deficiency (area under curve 0.620; cutoff value > 137 × 10(9)/L, 
      sensitivity 76%, specificity 43%) and functional iron deficiency (area under 
      curve 0.540; cutoff value > 124 × 10(9)/L, sensitivity 77%, specificity 32%). 
      Platelet count was negatively correlated with ferritin (Spearman's rho [ρ] 
      -0.1547, P < .001), transferrin saturation (ρ = -0.1895, P < .001), and serum 
      iron (ρ = -0.1466, P < .001). The abovementioned correlations remained 
      significant in multivariate regression (β -0.7285, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      -1.0757 to -0.3814; β -.00347, 95% CI -0.0520 to -0.0174; β -0.0097, 95% CI 
      -0.0159 to -0.0035, respectively). In unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression 
      models, neither baseline platelet count nor relative thrombocytosis was 
      associated with 3-year mortality. CONCLUSION: There was a weak but significant 
      platelet count elevation in patients with ESRD and with iron deficiency.

TI  - Iron homeostasis in chronic inflammation.
PG  - 95-106
AB  - Inflammation induced anemia and resistance to erythropoietin are common features 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Elevated levels of cytokines and 
      enhanced oxidative stress, conditions associated with inflammatory states, are 
      implicated in the development of anemia. Accumulating evidence suggests that 
      activation of cytokine cascade and the associated acute-phase response, as it 
      often occurs in patients with CKD, divert iron from erythropoiesis to storage 
      sites within the reticuloendothelial system leading to functional iron deficiency 
      and subsequently to anemia or resistance to erythropoietin. Other processes have 
      also been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of anemia provoked by the 
      activated immune system including an inhibition of erythroid progenitor 
      proliferation and differentiation, a suppression of erythropoietin production and 
      a blunted response to erythropoietin. The present review concerns the underlying 
      alterations in iron metabolism induced by chronic inflammation that result in 
      anemia.

TI  - Associations Between Intravenous Iron, Inflammation and FGF23 in Non-Dialysis 
      Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3-5.
PG  - 143-151
LID - 10.1159/000487368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Both iron deficiency and chronic inflammation are highly 
      prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effect of 
      intravenous iron infusion on mineral metabolism in CKD may be modified by 
      inflammation. Intravenous iron theraphy may reduce peripheral degradation, 
      secretion, clearence of iFGF23 and lead to hypophosphatemia. The aim of the study 
      was to evaluate the effect of intravenous iron on mineral metabolism in CKD 
      patients. METHODS: 35 non-dialysis patients with CKD stages 3-5. received 100 
      mg/24h of ferric oxide saccharated solution for 5 days. Serum calcium (Ca), 
      phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH), intact-FGF23 (iFGF23), C-terminal-FGF23 
      (cFGF23), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and high-sensitive CRP were assessed on 
      day 1 and 3 at baseline and 2 hours after each dose administration and once on 
      day 6. Plasma iFGF23 and cFGF23, as well as serum BAP were measured with ELISA 
      and other parameters with standard automated laboratory methods. RESULTS: Serum 
      iFGF23 increased after iv iron on day 1 and 6 (from 268.9±446.5 to 326.3±529.9 on 
      day 1; p=0.05 and to 451.4±601 pg/mL on day 6; p=0.03). cFGF23 was reduced only 
      on day 1 (from 654.3±441.3 to 473.6±414 RU/mL; p=0.016). P concentration 
      decreased significantly two hours after the first iron infusion (from 1.69±0.5 to 
      1.54±0.35 mmol/l; p=0.003). In following days the changes of cFGF23, P and of 
      other calcium-phosphate metabolism were not significant. Serum CRP correlated 
      neither with iFGF-23 nor cFGF-23. CONCLUSION: Intravenous iron supplementation 
      may only transiently affect the production and degradation of FGF23 resulting in 
      hypophosphatemia at the commencement of iron therapy. Chronic low-grade 
      inflammation does not seem to play a role in that mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 
      not on dialysis (ND). Restoring depleted iron stores through intravenous (IV) 
      route is faster and associated with less side effects. There is conflicting data 
      regarding intravenous iron use and its impact on clinical outcomes in this 
      population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at evaluating any negative clinical impact 
      associated with IV iron use in CKD patients at stages (3-5) before dialysis. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING AND POPULATION: Chart analysis of ND 
      CKD 3-5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) 
      patients who received IV iron between January 2013 and January 2018 in 3 major 
      hospitals in Kuwait. METHODS: Outcomes analyzed were rates of all-cause 
      hospitalizations, infection-related hospitalizations, mortality rates, and eGFR 
      decline over 12 months after IV iron infusion in this population divided into 3 
      groups according to CKD stage. RESULTS: A total of 738 patients were included in 
      our analysis. Mean initial hemoglobin concentration was 111.5 ± 15.0 g/L in group 
      1 (CKD 3: eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 103.6 ± 17.7 g/L in group 2 (CKD 4: eGFR 
      15-29 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and 99.4 ± 14.5 g/L in group 3 (CKD 5: eGFR < 15 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2) but not on dialysis). All-cause hospitalization and 
      infection-related hospitalization were more common among group 3 subjects 
      (adjusted odds ratio =2.12 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.32-3.41] and 2.02 [95% 
      CI: 1.15-3.55]), respectively. No deaths occurred during 12 months of follow-up. 
      LIMITATIONS: Lack of control group, retrospective study. CONCLUSION: Intravenous 
      iron use in CKD 3-5 ND is generally safe. Higher hospitalization rates in 
      patients with eGFR <30 mL/min are possibly associated with lower baseline 
      hemoglobin, lower baseline eGFR, and higher comorbidity burden, and not related 
      to iron infusion.

AB  - There are two major forms of kidney disease: acute renal failure [also referred 
      to as acute kidney injury (AKI)] and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute renal 
      failure is an abrupt loss of kidney function within 48 h, whereas CKD is a loss 
      of kidney function greater than 3 months. There is a large amount of experimental 
      evidence for an increase of labile iron in a wide variety of models of kidney 
      disease. Additionally, iron chelators provide protection, indicating an important 
      role of labile iron in these diseases. These observations suggest that iron 
      chelators may provide a new modality of prevention and treatment of kidney 
      disease.

TI  - Next-generation phosphate binders: focus on iron-based binders.
PG  - 863-77
LID - 10.1007/s40265-014-0224-6 [doi]
AB  - Phosphate excess is associated with increased mortality in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and has recently been linked to accelerated aging. Oral 
      phosphate binders are prescribed to patients with CKD to prevent absorption of 
      dietary phosphate. Currently available binders have been associated with impaired 
      outcomes (calcium-based binders) or are expensive (non-calcium-based binders). 
      Iron-based phosphate binders represent a new class of phosphate binders. Four 
      iron-based phosphate binders have undergone testing in clinical trials. The 
      development of fermagate and SBR759 is currently on hold due to suboptimal and 
      adverse effect profiles in at least some clinical trials. Ferric citrate and 
      sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21) are at different stages of application for 
      regulatory approval after being found safe and efficacious in decreasing serum 
      phosphate. Iron from ferric citrate is more readily absorbed than that from 
      sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was launched in the USA in 
      2014 for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in adult dialysis patients. Ferric 
      citrate may be more suited for chronic treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD 
      patients requiring iron supplements but its use may have to be limited in time 
      because of potential for iron overload in patients not needing iron or not 
      receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In contrast, sucroferric 
      oxyhydroxide may be more suited for hyperphosphatemic CKD patients not requiring 
      iron supplements.

AB  - Iron deficiency is an important clinical concern in chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      giving rise to iron-deficiency anaemia, and various impaired cellular functions. 
      Oral supplementation, in particular with ferrous salts, is associated with a high 
      rate of gastro-intestinal side effects and is poorly absorbed, a problem that is 
      avoided with intravenous (IV) irons. Recently, with the approval of the European 
      Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the French 
      Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) took 
      adequate measures to minimize the risk of allergic reactions, by correction on 
      the summary of intravenous iron products characteristics. All IV iron products 
      should be prescribed, administered and injected, inside public or private 
      hospitals exclusively, and a clinical follow-up after the infusion for at least 
      30 minutes is mandatory. The most stable intravenous iron complexes (low 
      molecular weight iron dextran, ferric carboxymaltose, and iron isomaltoside 1000 
      [under agreement]) can be given in higher single doses and more rapidly than less 
      recent preparations such as iron sucrose (originator or similars). Test doses are 
      advisable for conventional low molecular weight iron dextrans, but are no more 
      mandatory. Iron supplementation is recommended for all CKD patients with 
      iron-deficiency anaemia and those who receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, 
      whether or not they require dialysis. Intravenous iron is the preferred route of 
      administration in haemodialysis patients, with randomized trials showing a 
      significantly greater increase in haemoglobin levels for intravenous versus oral 
      iron and a low rate of treatment-related adverse events during these trials. 
      According ANSM, physicians should apply the product's label recommendations 
      especially the posology. In the non-dialysis CKD population, the erythropoietic 
      response is also significantly higher using intravenous versus oral iron, and 
      tolerability is at least as good. Moreover in some non-dialysis patients, 
      intravenous iron supplementation might avoid or at least delay the need for 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Following the new ANSM's recommendations, we 
      now have the ability to achieve iron stores replenishment correctly and 
      conveniently in dialysis dependent and non-dialysis dependent CKD patients 
      without compromising safety using the various pharmaceutical forms of iron 
      products especially intravenous compounds.

AB  - Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that develops 
      early and its severity increases as renal function declines. It is mainly due to 
      a reduced production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the kidneys; however, there are 
      evidences that iron metabolism disturbances increase as CKD progresses. Our aim 
      was to study the mechanisms underlying the development of anemia of CKD, as well 
      as renal damage, in the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 
      nephrectomy. This model of CKD presented a sustained degree of renal dysfunction, 
      with mild and advanced glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions. Anemia 
      developed 3 weeks after nephrectomy and persisted throughout the protocol. The 
      remnant kidney was still able to produce EPO and the liver showed an increased 
      EPO gene expression. In spite of the increased EPO blood levels, anemia persisted 
      and was linked to low serum iron and transferrin levels, while serum interleukin 
      (IL)-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels showed the absence 
      of systemic inflammation. The increased expression of duodenal ferroportin 
      favours iron absorption; however, serum iron is reduced which might be due to 
      iron leakage through advanced kidney lesions, as showed by tubular iron 
      accumulation. Our data suggest that the persistence of anemia may result from 
      disturbances in iron metabolism and by an altered activity/function of EPO as a 
      result of kidney cell damage and a local inflammatory milieu, as showed by the 
      increased gene expression of different inflammatory proteins in the remnant 
      kidney. In addition, this anemia and the associated kidney hypoxia favour the 
      development of fibrosis, angiogenesis and inflammation that may underlie a 
      resistance to EPO stimuli and reduced iron availability. These findings might 
      contribute to open new windows to identify putative therapeutic targets for this 
      condition, as well as for recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) resistance, which occurs 
      in a considerable percentage of CKD patients.

TI  - Changes in Iron Availability with Roxadustat in Nondialysis- and

PG  - 1511-1528
LID - 10.34067/KID.0001442022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, 
      increases hemoglobin by stimulating erythropoietin synthesis and improving iron 
      availability through facilitation of iron uptake and/or release from stores. In 
      this exploratory analysis, we assessed the effect of roxadustat treatment on 
      laboratory parameters related to iron metabolism in patients with anemia of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Data were pooled from pivotal, randomized, 
      phase 3 roxadustat trials: three placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in 
      nondialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD and three open-label, active-comparator (epoetin 
      alfa) trials in dialysis-dependent (DD) CKD. In this exploratory analysis, mean 
      changes from baseline in hemoglobin, iron parameters, and hepcidin, and 
      intravenous (iv) iron use were evaluated. Pooled results in NDD CKD and DD CKD 
      patients are reported. RESULTS: Overall, 4277 patients with NDD CKD and 3890 
      patients with DD CKD were evaluated. Hemoglobin increases with roxadustat 
      treatment were accompanied by increases in serum iron and total iron-binding 
      capacity (TIBC) and decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin from baseline 
      through week 52. With epoetin alfa, the hemoglobin increase was accompanied by 
      decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin, but serum iron decreased, and there was 
      no change in TIBC. With placebo, there were no changes in hemoglobin, iron 
      parameters, or hepcidin. During treatment, iv iron use was reduced with 
      roxadustat versus placebo and epoetin alfa. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NDD CKD 
      and DD CKD, roxadustat treatment is associated with increases in serum iron and 
      TIBC, accompanied by reduced hepcidin and indicative of improved iron kinetics. 
      Patients treated with roxadustat achieved target hemoglobin levels with less iv 
      iron use versus comparators. Practitioners treating patients with anemia of CKD 
      with roxadustat should consider its unique effects when interpreting iron 
      parameters.

TI  - [Safety aspects of parenteral iron supplementation therapies in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease].
PG  - 1312-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1343219 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency often occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease and can be 
      effectively treated with parenteral supplementation of iron. In these patients, 
      prompt application of iron therapy can help to reduce the dependence of 
      erythropoietin-stimulating agents and effectively treat anemia. Correct 
      evaluation of iron metabolism in CKD patients can be difficult. Duration of and 
      response to therapy should always be considered while planning parenteral 
      supplementation of iron. The main safety aspects of parenteral iron preparations 
      relate to their possible anaphylactic potential and the potential induction of 
      oxidative stress due to the release of free iron. However, parenteral iron 
      supplementation is usually safe and without major side effects. Regarding current 
      data, none of the iron preparations is showing definitive superiority. Although 
      uncommon, iron preparations containing dextran can lead to severe side effects, 
      therefore these preparations appear to have an inferior safety profile. Due to 
      limited data, a comparison of third-generation iron preparations with previous 
      preparations is not possible. Recently, for the first time, the third generation 
      iron preparation ferumoxytol has been directly compared to iron sucrose. From 
      this data and others, it remains unclear whether third generation iron 
      preparations show safety-relevant superiority.

LID - 10.1111/j.1432-2277.2008.00814.x [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency contributes to anemia after transplantation. The magnitude of 
      iron loss from blood loss in the peri-transplantation period has not been 
      quantified. We prospectively estimated phlebotomy and surgical losses over the 
      first 12-weeks following transplantation in 39 consecutive renal transplant 
      recipients on hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), or chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). At transplant, ferritin levels were <200 ng/ml in 51% of the 
      patients, and iron saturation was </=20% in 44%. CKD patients more commonly had 
      ferritin levels <200 ng/ml than either HD or PD patients (100% vs. 21% vs. 67%, P 
      < 0.0002, respectively). Blood loss was similar among HD, PD and CKD patients 
      (833 +/- 194 vs. 861 +/- 324 vs. 755 +/- 79 ml respectively, P = NS), and no 
      difference between deceased and living donor transplant recipients (881 +/- 291 
      vs. 788 +/- 162 ml, P = 0.33). Based on baseline hemoglobin (Hgb) of 11.8 g/dl, 
      we estimated that an additional 330 mg of iron was needed to normalize hemoglobin 
      to 13 g/dl, and 605 mg to increase hemoglobin to 14 g/dl. Blood and iron losses 
      over the first 12 weeks post-transplant are substantial and may warrant early 
      administration of intravenous iron.

PG  - 363-367
LID - 10.1080/00365513.2019.1622149 [doi]
AB  - We studied the performance of mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (MCHr), 
      measured on Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire analyzer for the detection of functional 
      iron deficiency. Patients with anemia and with renal disease were prospectively 
      selected from the outpatient population of our hospital, 512 subjects were 
      studied. Diagnoses and other medical data were retrieved from the hospital 
      information system. MCHr was measured using a CELL-DYN Sapphire hematology 
      analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics). Standard laboratory and statistical tests were 
      used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to establish the 
      diagnostic performance of MCHr for detecting iron-restricted erythropoiesis, with 
      transferrin saturation <20% as the gold standard. Patients in the iron deficiency 
      anemia group all had a state of iron depletion and iron-restricted erythropoiesis 
      (median MCHr 25.4 pg). Patients with anemia of chronic disease showed also low 
      MCHr, median 27.6 pg, but not statistically different from the iron deficient 
      group (p = .0585). Renal patients with iron restriction (n = 66) had 
      significantly lower MCHr (p < .0001) than those receiving adequate iron supply 
      (n = 100): median MCHr were 27.9 and 32.5 pg, respectively. ROC analysis gave 
      sensitivity 84.4% and specificity 80.1% with area under curve 0.863 (95% CI 
      0.823-0.902) at an MCHr cut-off 30.0 pg. MCHr on CELL-DYN Sapphire has equivalent 
      clinical performance for detecting absolute or functional iron deficiency in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease as previously published for another type of 
      analyzer.

TI  - Bone marrow iron distribution, hepcidin, and ferroportin expression in renal 
      anemia.
PG  - 543-52
LID - 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The hepcidin-ferroportin system is involved in both conditions 
      associated with iron-restricted erythropoiesis in renal anemia: iron deficiency 
      and anemia of chronic disorders. As serum hepcidin could aid diagnosis, we 
      investigated its relationships with bone marrow iron distribution, 
      hepcidin-ferroportin expression in bone marrow cells, and peripheral iron indices 
      in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. METHODS: Fifty-four 
      epoetin and iron naive CKD patients entered this prospective, observational 
      study. According to bone marrow iron distribution (iliac crest biopsy, Perls' 
      stain), 26 had iron deficiency anemia, 21 anemia of chronic disorders and 7 had 
      normal iron stores. Medullar hepcidin and ferroportin expression 
      (immunofluorescence (IF), semiquantitative scales) and serum hepcidin (Hep25 - 
      ELISA) were the main studied parameters. RESULTS: Low hepcidin and high 
      ferroportin expression by erythroblast and macrophage were seen in iron 
      deficiency anemia, while the opposites were true in anemia of chronic disorders. 
      In regression analysis, higher Hep25 and ferritin predicted hepcidin expression 
      (R(2)=0.48; P < 0.0001), while lower ferritin and Hep25 - predicted ferroportin 
      expression (R(2) = 0.29; P = 0.003) by erythroblast; inflammation had no 
      contribution. In ROC analysis, serum hepcidin and ferritin had similar moderate 
      utility in differentiating iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic 
      disorders (AUC 0.63 95% CI 0.47-0.79 and 0.76 95% CI 0.61-0.90, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in anemic epoetin naive non-dialysis CKD patients, hepcidin 
      and ferroportin expression by erythroblast and macrophage are closely related to 
      bone marrow iron distribution. Although the hepcidin-ferroportin system seems 
      regulated by ferritin-driven Hep25, serum hepcidin and peripheral iron indices 
      are of little help in describing bone marrow iron status.

AB  - Iron deficiency commonly affects patients with chronic kidney disease and has an 
      important burden in disease trajectory and quality of life; nonetheless current 
      guidelines do not advocate treatment of iron-deficiency without anemia in this 
      patient group. Concerns exist regarding the potential effects of intravenous iron 
      on oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial function. As part of a 
      multicenter double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial, we examined the 
      effects of a single dose of intravenous iron vs. placebo on biomarkers of 
      oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial function in non-anemic iron 
      deficient patients (serum ferritin < 100 μg/L and/or transferrin 
      saturation < 20%) with chronic kidney disease (stage 3b-5). Fifty-four 
      individuals were randomized to receive ferric derisomaltose (n = 26) or placebo 
      (n = 28). Ferric derisomaltose was associated with a non-significant decrease in 
      mean F2-isoprostane and no effect on thiobarbituric acid reactive substances when 
      compared to placebo throughout follow up. No effect on inflammatory markers was 
      observed. A modest but statistically significant rise in E-selectin was noted in 
      the intravenous iron group at 1 month and 3 month follow-up (p = 0.030 and 
      p = 0.002 respectively). These results suggest ferric derisomaltose 
      administration in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients who are 
      iron deficient does not induce prolonged oxidative stress or inflammation. Larger 
      trials are required to quantify the benefit of intravenous iron administration in 
      this patient group.

AB  - Before the introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in 1989, 
      repeated transfusions given to patients with end-stage renal disease caused iron 
      overload, and the need for supplemental iron was rare. However, with the 
      widespread introduction of ESAs, it was recognized that supplemental iron was 
      necessary to optimize hemoglobin response and allow reduction of the ESA dose for 
      economic reasons and recent concerns about ESA safety. Iron supplementation was 
      also found to be more efficacious via intravenous compared to oral 
      administration, and the use of intravenous iron has escalated in recent years. 
      The safety of various iron compounds has been of theoretical concern due to their 
      potential to induce iron overload, oxidative stress, hypersensitivity reactions, 
      and a permissive environment for infectious processes. Therefore, an expert group 
      was convened to assess the benefits and risks of parenteral iron, and to provide 
      strategies for its optimal use while mitigating the risk for acute reactions and 
      other adverse effects.

TI  - Ferumoxytol: a new intravenous iron preparation for the treatment of iron 
      deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 70-9
LID - 10.1592/phco.30.1.70 [doi]
AB  - Ferumoxytol is an intravenous iron preparation for treatment of the anemia of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is a carbohydrate-coated, superparamagnetic iron 
      oxide nanoparticle. Because little free iron is present in the preparation, doses 
      of 510 mg have been administered safely in as little as 17 seconds. Two 
      prospective, randomized studies compared two doses of ferumoxytol 510 mg given in 
      5 +/- 3 days with 3 weeks of oral iron 200 mg/day (as ferrous fumarate) in anemic 
      patients with CKD. One study enrolled 304 patients with stages 1-5 CKD 
      (predialysis), and the other study enrolled 230 patients with stage 5D CKD 
      (undergoing hemodialysis). In both studies, a greater increase in hemoglobin 
      level from baseline to end of study (day 35) was noted in patients who received 
      ferumoxytol compared with those who received oral iron (mean +/- SD 0.82 +/- 1.24 
      vs 0.16 +/- 1.02 g/dl in patients with stages 1-5 CKD and 1.02 +/- 1.13 vs 0.46 
      +/- 1.06 g/dl in patients with stage 5D CKD, p<0.001). A greater proportion of 
      both predialysis and hemodialysis patients who received ferumoxytol had 
      hemoglobin level increases from baseline of 1 g/dl or more compared with those 
      who received oral iron (p<0.001). In a prospective, double-blind, crossover study 
      of more than 700 patients with CKD stages 1-5D that compared the safety of 
      ferumoxytol with normal saline injection, the rates of treatment-related adverse 
      events were 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively. Serious treatment-related adverse events 
      were seen in one patient in each treatment group. The most common adverse events 
      with ferumoxytol occurred at the injection site (bruising, pain, swelling, 
      erythema). Dizziness, nausea, pruritus, headache, and fatigue occurred in less 
      than 2% of patients receiving ferumoxytol, with a similar frequency noted after 
      administration of normal saline. In short-term studies, intravenous ferumoxytol 
      was safely and rapidly administered, and was more effective than oral iron 
      therapy in increasing hemoglobin levels in anemic patients with CKD. Long-term 
      clinical trials with clinical outcomes and studies comparing ferumoxytol with 
      other parenteral iron agents will help define the role of ferumoxytol in treating 
      the anemia of CKD.

TI  - [Iron supplementation in chronic kidney disease].
PG  - 1215-1218
AB  - Treatment with iron preparations remains one of the main directions in the 
      treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Intravenous agents, 
      although effective, may have serious adverse effects, while oral iron 
      supplementation may be ineffective due to malabsorption and gastrointestinal side 
      effects. The solution may be modern drugs such as ferric pyrophosphate added to 
      dialysis fluid or liposomal iron without gastrointestinal adverse effects.

TI  - The Influence of Iron-Deficiency Anaemia (IDA) Therapy on Clinical Outcomes and 
      Healthcare Resource Consumptions in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Affected by 
      IDA: A Real-Word Evidence Study among the Italian Population.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11195820 [doi]
LID - 5820
AB  - Anaemia is a uraemia-related complication frequently found in 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients, with 
      iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the main underlying mechanism. Given the 
      suboptimal anaemia management in ND-CKD patients with a co-diagnosis of IDA, this 
      study evaluated the role of IDA therapy on clinical outcomes and healthcare 
      resource consumptions in an Italian clinical setting. A retrospective 
      observational real-world analysis was performed on administrative databases of 
      healthcare entities, covering around 6.9 million health-assisted individuals. 
      From January 2010 to March 2019, ND-CKD patients were included and diagnosed with 
      IDA in the presence of two low-haemoglobin (Hb) measurements. Patients were 
      divided into IDA-treated and untreated, based on the prescription of iron 
      [Anatomical-Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code B03A] or anti-anaemia preparations 
      (ATC code B03X), and evaluated during a 6-month follow-up from the index date 
      [first low haemoglobin (Hb) detection]. IDA treatment resulted in significantly 
      decreased incidence of all cause-related, cardiovascular-related, and IDA-related 
      hospitalizations (treated vs. untreated: 44.5% vs. 81.8%, 12.3% vs. 25.3%, and 
      16.2% vs. 26.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). A healthcare direct cost estimation 
      showed that overall mean expenditure per patient reduced by 47% with IDA 
      treatment (5245€ vs. 9918€, p < 0.001), mainly attributable to hospitalizations 
      (3767€ vs. 8486€, p < 0.001). This real-life analysis on Italian ND-CKD-IDA 
      patients indicates that IDA therapy administration provides significant benefits 
      in terms of patients’ clinical outcomes and healthcare cost savings.

TI  - Association of different iron deficiency cutoffs with adverse outcomes in chronic 
      kidney disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. In clinical practice, iron deficiency is defined based on a combination 
      of two commonly used markers, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 
      However, no consensus has been reached which cutoffs of these parameters should 
      be applied to define iron deficiency. Hence, we aimed to assess prospectively 
      which cutoffs of ferritin and TSAT performed optimally for outcomes in CKD 
      patients. METHODS: We meticulously analyzed 975 CKD community dwelling patients 
      of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease prospective study based 
      on an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73m(2), albuminuria 
      > 30 mg/24 h, or albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g. Cox proportional hazard 
      regression analyses using different sets and combinations of cutoffs of ferritin 
      and TSAT were performed to assess prospective associations with all-cause 
      mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and development of anemia. RESULTS: Of the 
      included 975 CKD patients (62 ± 12 years, 64% male with an estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate of 77 ± 23 ml/min/1.73m(2)), 173 CKD patients died during a 
      median follow-up of 8.0 (interquartile range 7.5-8.7) years of which 70 from a 
      cardiovascular cause. Furthermore, 164 CKD patients developed anemia. The highest 
      risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.53-5.24), cardiovascular mortality (4.15; 1.78-9.66), and developing anemia 
      (3.07; 1.69-5.57) was uniformly observed for a TSAT< 10%, independent of serum 
      ferritin level. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have shown that of the 
      traditionally used markers of iron status, reduced TSAT, especially TSAT< 10%, is 
      most strongly associated with the risk of adverse outcomes in CKD patients 
      irrespective of serum ferritin level, suggesting that clinicians should focus 
      more on TSAT rather than ferritin in this patient setting. Specific attention to 
      iron levels below this cutoff seems warranted in CKD patients.

TI  - Erythropoietic response to oral iron in patients with nondialysis-dependent 
      chronic kidney disease in the FIND-CKD trial .
PG  - 301-310
LID - 10.5414/CN109198 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate erythropoietic response rates to oral iron over time in 
      iron-deficient anemic patients with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease 
      (ND-CKD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: FIND-CKD was a 1-year, randomized, multicenter 
      trial of iron therapy in patients with ND-CKD, anemia, and iron deficiency, 
      without erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. Patients with active 
      infection or C-reactive protein > 20 mg/L were excluded. In this post-hoc 
      analysis, response was defined as ≥ 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin (Hb) from 
      baseline, before initiation of alternative anemia therapy (i.e., ESA, 
      transfusion, or intravenous iron). RESULTS: 308 patients received oral iron (200 
      mg elemental iron/day). Mean (SD) Hb at baseline was 10.4 (0.7) g/dL. At week 4, 
      Hb data were available from 292 patients without alternative anemia therapy: 
      63/292 (21.6%) showed a response. Among the 229 nonresponders at week 4, 48.8% 
      showed a cumulative response on ≥ 1 occasion by week 52 (11.1%, 19.9%, 25.9%, and 
      28.7% had a response at weeks 8, 12, 24, and 52, respectively), and 27.9% had 
      received alternative iron therapy by week 52. Baseline levels of Hb, ferritin, 
      and transferrin saturation were lower in responders than in nonresponders. 
      Neither concomitant medication nor adherence (as assessed by medication count) 
      was substantially different between early responders and nonresponders. 
      CONCLUSION: Four weeks after starting oral iron therapy, only 21.6% of anemic 
      patients with ND-CKD and iron deficiency showed an Hb increase of at least 1 
      g/dL. Among early nonresponders, < 30% responded at any subsequent time point. 
      Earlier consideration of alternative therapy could improve anemia management in 
      this population. .

TI  - Oxidants and iron in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - S50-5
AB  - Oxidants derived either from leukocytes in proliferative glomerular nephritis or 
      from resident glomerular cells in nonproliferative glomerulonephritis have been 
      shown to have several biologic effects relevant to chronic kidney disease. These 
      include: the ability of oxidants to damage glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and 
      to directly induce proteinuria; effects that would lead to a fall in the 
      glomerular filtration rate; and effects that would account for the morphologic 
      changes observed in chronic kidney disease. In experimental models the role of 
      oxidants has been demonstrated in both proliferative glomerulonephritis (e.g., 
      anti-GBM antibody disease) as well as experimental models of minimal change 
      disease and membranous nephropathy. Oxidants have also been shown to be an 
      important mediator of the various pathways that have been implicated in diabetic 
      nephropathy. Antioxidants and iron chelators have also been shown to retard 
      functional and morphologic changes observed in progressive kidney disease. Taken 
      together, these experimental studies suggest an important role of oxidants in 
      chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Impact of Intravenous Iron on Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Function in 
      Experimental Chronic Kidney Disease.
LID - 10.3390/antiox8100498 [doi]
LID - 498
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is observed in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), a common complication in CKD, is associated 
      with poor clinical outcomes affecting mitochondrial function and exacerbating 
      oxidative stress. Intravenous (iv) iron, that is used to treat anaemia, may lead 
      to acute systemic oxidative stress. This study evaluated the impact of iv iron on 
      mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. METHODS: Uraemia was induced 
      surgically in male Sprague-Dawley rats and studies were carried out 12 weeks 
      later in two groups sham operated and uraemic (5/6 nephrectomy) rats not exposed 
      to i.v. iron versus sham operated and uraemic rats with iv iron. RESULTS: 
      Induction of uraemia resulted in reduced iron availability (serum iron: 31.1 ± 
      1.8 versus 46.4 ± 1.4 µM), low total iron binding capacity (26.4 ± 0.7 versus 
      29.5 ± 0.8 µM), anaemia (haematocrit: 42.5 ± 3.0 versus 55.0 ± 3.0%), cardiac 
      hypertrophy, reduced systemic glutathione peroxidase activity (1.12 ± 0.11 versus 
      1.48 ± 0.12 U/mL), tissue oxidative stress (oxidised glutathione: 0.50 ± 0.03 
      versus 0.36 ± 0.04 nmol/mg of tissue), renal mitochondrial dysfunction 
      (proton/electron leak: 61.8 ± 8.0 versus 22.7 ± 5.77) and complex I respiration 
      (134.6 ± 31.4 versus 267.6 ± 26.4 pmol/min/µg). Iron therapy had no effect on 
      renal function and cardiac hypertrophy but improved anaemia and systemic 
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. There was increased renal iron content and 
      complex II and complex IV dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Iron therapy improved iron 
      deficiency anaemia in CKD without significant impact on renal function or oxidant 
      status.

TI  - Glycochenodeoxycholate Affects Iron Homeostasis via Up-Regulating Hepcidin 
      Expression.
LID - 10.3390/nu14153176 [doi]
LID - 3176
AB  - Increasing hepcidin expression is a vital factor in iron homeostasis imbalance 
      among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have elucidated 
      that abnormal serum steroid levels might cause the elevation of hepcidin. 
      Glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDCA), a steroid, is significantly elevated in patients 
      with CKD. However, the correlation between GCDCA and hepcidin has not been 
      elucidated. Decreased serum iron levels and increased hepcidin levels were both 
      detected in patients with CKD in this study. Additionally, the concentrations of 
      GCDCA in nephropathy patients were found to be higher than those in healthy 
      subjects. HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of GCDCA on hepcidin in 
      vitro. The results showed that hepcidin expression increased by nearly two-fold 
      against control under 200 μM GCDCA treatment. The phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 
      increased remarkably, while STAT3 and CREBH remained unchanged. GCDCA triggered 
      the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), followed with the transcription and 
      expression of both BMP6 and ALK3 (upward regulators of SMAD1/5/8). Thus, GCDCA is 
      a potential regulator for hepcidin, which possibly acts by triggering FXR and the 
      BMP6/ALK3-SMAD signaling pathway. Furthermore, 40 C57/BL6 mice were treated with 
      100 mg/kg/d, 200 mg/kg/d, and 300 mg/kg/d GCDCA to investigate its effect on 
      hepcidin in vivo. The serum level of hepcidin increased in mice treated with 200 
      mg/kg/d and 300 mg/kg/d GCDCA, while hemoglobin and serum iron levels decreased. 
      Similarly, the FXR-mediated SMAD signaling pathway was also responsible for 
      activating hepcidin in liver. Overall, it was concluded that GCDCA could induce 
      the expression of hepcidin and reduce serum iron level, in which FXR 
      activation-related SMAD signaling was the main target for GCDCA. Thus, abnormal 
      GCDCA level indicates a potential risk of iron homeostasis imbalance.

TI  - Optimizing iron delivery in the management of anemia: patient considerations and 
      the role of ferric carboxymaltose.
PG  - 2475-91
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S55499 [doi]
AB  - With the challenge of optimizing iron delivery, new intravenous (iv) 
      iron-carbohydrate complexes have been developed in the last few years. A good 
      example of these new compounds is ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), which has recently 
      been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of iron 
      deficiency anemia in adult patients who are intolerant to oral iron or present an 
      unsatisfactory response to oral iron, and in adult patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). FCM is a robust and 
      stable complex similar to ferritin, which minimizes the release of labile iron 
      during administration, allowing higher doses to be administered in a single 
      application and with a favorable cost-effective rate. Cumulative information from 
      randomized, controlled, multicenter trials on a diverse range of indications, 
      including patients with chronic heart failure, postpartum anemia/abnormal uterine 
      bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, NDD-CKD, and those undergoing hemodialysis, 
      supports the efficacy of FCM for iron replacement in patients with iron 
      deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Furthermore, as FCM is a dextran-free 
      iron-carbohydrate complex (which has a very low risk for hypersensitivity 
      reactions) with a small proportion of the reported adverse effects in a large 
      number of subjects who received FCM, it may be considered a safe drug. Therefore, 
      FCM appears as an interesting option to apply high doses of iron as a single 
      infusion in a few minutes in order to obtain the quick replacement of iron 
      stores. The present review on FCM summarizes diverse aspects such as pharmacology 
      characteristics and analyzes trials on the efficacy/safety of FCM versus oral 
      iron and different iv iron compounds in multiple clinical scenarios. 
      Additionally, the information on cost effectiveness and data on change in quality 
      of life are also discussed.

TI  - Iron Supplementation Improves Skeletal Muscle Contractile Properties in Mice with 
      CKD.
PG  - 843-858
LID - 10.34067/KID.0004412021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently have 
      compromised physical performance, which increases their mortality; however, their 
      skeletal muscle dysfunction has not been characterized at the single-fiber and 
      molecular levels. Notably, interventions to mitigate CKD myopathy are scarce. 
      METHODS: The effect of CKD in the absence and presence of iron supplementation on 
      the contractile function of individual skeletal muscle fibers from the soleus and 
      extensor digitorum longus muscles was evaluated in 16-week-old mice. CKD was 
      induced by the adenine diet, and iron supplementation was by weekly iron dextran 
      injections. RESULTS: Maximally activated and fatigued fiber force production was 
      decreased 24%-52% in untreated CKD, independent of size, by reducing strongly 
      bound myosin/actin cross-bridges and/or decreasing myofilament stiffness in 
      myosin heavy chain (MHC) I, IIA, and IIB fibers. Additionally, myosin/actin 
      interactions in untreated CKD were slower for MHC I and IIA fibers and unchanged 
      or faster in MHC IIB fibers. Iron supplementation improved anemia and did not 
      change overall muscle mass in CKD mice. Iron supplementation ameliorated 
      CKD-induced myopathy by increasing strongly bound cross-bridges, leading to 
      improved specific tension, and/or returning the rate of myosin/actin interactions 
      toward or equivalent to control values in MHC IIA and IIB fibers. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Skeletal muscle force production was significantly reduced in untreated CKD, 
      independent of fiber size, indicating that compromised physical function in 
      patients is not solely due to muscle mass loss. Iron supplementation improved 
      multiple aspects of CKD-induced myopathy, suggesting that timely correction of 
      iron imbalance may aid in ameliorating contractile deficits in CKD patients.

TI  - Serum hepcidin-25 and response to intravenous iron in patients with non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 81-8
LID - 10.1007/s40620-014-0083-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepcidin-25 is an iron regulator which reduces iron absorption and 
      promotes sequestration in the reticulo-endothelial system. We investigated 
      hepcidin and traditional iron storage marker utility in predicting haemoglobin 
      increment following bolus intravenous iron. METHODS: The cohort included 129 
      consecutive non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients that attended for 
      intravenous iron over a 6-month period. Serum hepcidin-25 levels (determined by 
      mass spectrometry) pre iron infusion and 6 weeks post were compared with ferritin 
      and transferrin saturation in multivariate models. RESULTS: Log10 ferritin 
      [coefficient 0.559 (0.435-0.684) p < 0.001] and log10 high-sensitive C-reactive 
      protein [coefficient 0.092 (0.000-0.184) p = 0.049] were significantly associated 
      with baseline log10 hepcidin-25 levels. Log10 estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate was the only independent determinant of pre-infusion haemoglobin 
      [coefficient 1.37 (0.16-2.59) p = 0.027]. Log10 hepcidin-25 was an independent 
      predictor of haemoglobin increment 6 weeks following iron infusion [coefficient 
      -0.84 (-1.38 to -0.31) p = 0.002]. Ferritin, transferrin saturation and hepcidin 
      had similar predictive utility for a 1 g/dl haemoglobin increase (c-statistics: 
      0.68, 0.70, 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Hepcidin is an iron sensor marker which predicts 
      the magnitude of haemoglobin increment following protocolised intravenous iron 
      infusion. Although displaying similar predictive performance to ferritin and 
      transferrin saturation, hepcidin may also play a mechanistic role.

TI  - The benefits of IV iron therapy in treating anemia in patients with renal disease 
      and comorbid cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 199-206; quiz 207-8
AB  - It is important for nephrology nurses to understand the relationship that exists 
      between renal disease, cardiac disease, and anemia. Even mild cases of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) have been associated with an increase in adverse 
      cardiovascular outcomes. And anemia, which can result from both CKD and 
      congestive heart failure, has been shown to exacerbate the adverse consequences 
      of these conditions. An early, aggressive correction of anemia in patients with 
      CKD can be implemented to break this cycle and stop disease progression. Studies 
      have shown that anemia correction improves both cardiac and renal function and 
      can result in increased hemoglobin levels, decreased number of hospital days, and 
      improved quality of life. An effective strategy for managing anemia in patients 
      with renal disease and comorbid cardiovascular disease includes the 
      administration of both recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron. In 
      addition, the nephrology nurse plays an integral role in managing anemia and 
      improving outcomes in these patients. Therefore, the nephrology nurse should have 
      an increased awareness of the link between anemia and renal/cardiac disease as 
      well as available treatment options.

AB  - Hanudel et al. investigated the effects of hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl 
      hydroxylase domain inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) on iron metabolism in a chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) mouse model and showed that vadadustat, an HIF-PHI, exerted 
      beneficial effects on anemia and iron disorders independently of erythroferrone. 
      Vadadustat also inhibited the progression of CKD and the CKD-associated increase 
      of plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 in CKD mice. This study provides new 
      insights into the action of HIF-PIHs in CKD.

TI  - Parenteral iron compounds: potent oxidants but mainstays of anemia management in 
      chronic renal disease.
PG  - S24-31
AB  - Ferric iron (Fe)-carbohydrate complexes are widely used for treating Fe 
      deficiency in patients who are unable to meet their Fe requirements with oral 
      supplements. Intravenous Fe generally is well tolerated and effective in 
      correcting Fe-deficient states. However, the complexing of Fe to carbohydrate 
      polymers does not block its potent pro-oxidant effects; systemic free radical 
      generation and, possibly, tissue damage may result. The purpose of this review is 
      to (1) underscore the capacity of currently used parenteral Fe formulations to 
      induce oxidative stress, (2) compare the severity of these oxidant reactions with 
      those that result from unshielded Fe salts and with each other, and (3) speculate 
      as to the potential of these agents to induce acute renal cell injury and augment 
      systemic inflammatory responses. The experimental data that are reviewed should 
      not be extrapolated to the clinical setting or be used for clinical decision 
      making. Rather, it is hoped that the information provided herein may have utility 
      for clinical hypothesis generation and, hence, future clinical studies. By so 
      doing, a better understanding of Fe's potential protean effects on patients with 
      renal disease may result.

TI  - Markers of Oxidative Stress, Inflammation and Endothelial Function following 
      High-Dose Intravenous Iron in Patients with Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney 
      Disease-A Pooled Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms232416016 [doi]
LID - 16016
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a state of oxidative stress imbalance, 
      which is potentially amplified by iron deficiency. Intravenous iron is considered 
      safe and efficacious in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, however, 
      concerns remain regarding its potential pro-oxidant effect, leading to 
      inflammatory and endothelial consequences. This pooled analysis of two pilot 
      randomized controlled trials aimed to group and analyze the potential effect of 
      high-dose intravenous iron (ferric derisomaltose, 1000 mg) on markers of 
      oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance), inflammation 
      (C-reactive protein, interleukins 6 and 10) and endothelial response (E-selectin, 
      P-selectin) in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and iron deficiency 
      with/without anemia. Pulse wave velocity as a surrogate measure of arterial 
      stiffness was measured. Thirty-six patients were included. No statistically 
      significant trend was identified for any of the aforementioned markers. 
      Stratification and comparison of data based on CKD stage did not yield 
      statistically significant trajectories with the exception of the C-reactive 
      protein in CKD stage 3b. These results suggest that high-dose intravenous iron 
      does not impact measures of oxidative stress or inflammation; however, the 
      results are not conclusive. Further research in a larger cohort is necessary to 
      characterize the effect of intravenous iron on oxidative status and inflammation 
      and its potential sequela in CKD.

AB  - Although the primary cause of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is lack of 
      sufficient erythropoietin (EPO), other factors may be involved, including the 
      deregulation of iron metabolism. To clarify the mechanism of deranged 
      erythropoiesis in CKD, we evaluated bone marrow (BM) cells in adenine-induced CKD 
      mice. They showed even higher EPO expression in the kidney. Hepatic hepcidin mRNA 
      and plasma hepcidin and ferritin levels were increased. Flow cytometry revealed a 
      decrease in the number of cells expressing transferrin receptor (TfR), or late 
      erythroid progenitors in BM; these cells correspond to proerythroblasts, and 
      basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts. In CKD mice, levels of erythroferrone 
      mRNA in BM and splenic cells were significantly decreased, and MafB protein 
      levels in BM cells were significantly increased. These results suggest that, in 
      BM, the decrease in TfR, which may be associated with increased MafB levels, and 
      the decrease in erythroferrone increase hepatic hepcidin expression, which may 
      perturb iron recycling and erythropoiesis.

TI  - The Role of Iron and Erythropoietin in the Association of Fibroblast Growth 
      Factor 23 with Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease in Humans.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9082640 [doi]
LID - 2640
AB  - Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an almost universal complication of 
      this condition. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a key-player in mineral 
      metabolism, is reportedly associated with anemia and hemoglobin levels in 
      non-dialysis CKD patients. Here, we sought to further characterize this 
      association while taking into account the biologically active, intact fraction of 
      FGF23, iron metabolism, and erythropoietin (EPO). Hemoglobin, EPO, iron, and 
      mineral metabolism parameters, including both intact and c-terminal-FGF23 (iFGF23 
      and cFGF23, respectively) were measured cross-sectionally in 225 non-dialysis CKD 
      patients (stage 1-5, median eGFR: 30 mL/min./1.73m(2)) not on erythropoiesis 
      stimulating agents or intravenous iron therapy. Statistical analysis was 
      performed by multiple linear regression. After adjustment for eGFR and other 
      important confounders, only cFGF23 but not iFGF23 was significantly associated 
      with hemoglobin levels and this association was largely accounted for by iron 
      metabolism parameters. cFGF23 but not iFGF23 was also associated with mean 
      corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), again in 
      dependence on iron metabolism parameters. Similarly, EPO concentrations were 
      associated with cFGF23 but not iFGF23, but their contribution to the association 
      of cFGF23 with hemoglobin levels was marginal. In pre-dialysis CKD patients, the 
      observed association of FGF23 with hemoglobin seems to be restricted to cFGF23 
      and largely explained by the iron status.

AB  - The metabolism of hepcidin is profoundly modified in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). We investigated its relation to iron disorders, inflammation and 
      hemoglobin (Hb) level in 199 non-dialyzed, non-transplanted patients with CKD 
      stages 1-5. All had their glomerular filtration rate measured by 51Cr-EDTA renal 
      clearance (mGFR), as well as measurements of iron markers including hepcidin and 
      of erythropoietin (EPO). Hepcidin varied from 0.2 to 193 ng/mL. The median 
      increased from 23.3 ng/mL [8.8-28.7] to 36.1 ng/mL [14.1-92.3] when mGFR 
      decreased from ≥60 to <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.02). Patients with absolute iron 
      deficiency (transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20% and ferritin <40 ng/mL) had the 
      lowest hepcidin levels (5.0 ng/mL [0.7-11.7]), and those with a normal iron 
      profile (TSAT ≥20% and ferritin ≥40), the highest (34.5 ng/mL [23.7-51.6]). In 
      multivariate analysis, absolute iron deficiency was associated with lower 
      hepcidin values, and inflammation combined with a normal or functional iron 
      profile with higher values, independent of other determinants of hepcidin 
      concentration, including EPO, mGFR, and albuminemia. The hepcidin level, although 
      it rose overall when mGFR declined, collapsed in patients with absolute iron 
      deficiency. There was a significant interaction with iron status in the 
      association between Hb and hepcidin. Except in absolute iron deficiency, 
      hepcidin's negative association with Hb level indicates that it is not 
      down-regulated in CKD anemia.

TI  - Dietary iron restriction prevents further deterioration of renal damage in a 
      chronic kidney disease rat model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iron accumulation is associated with the pathogenesis of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). However, little is known about the effects of isolated iron 
      restriction against CKD. We have recently reported that iron restriction prevents 
      the development of renal damage in the well established 5/6 nephrectomy rat model 
      of CKD. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic effects of iron restriction on 
      preexisting hypertension and renal damage in a rat model of CKD. METHODS: CKD was 
      induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in Sprague-Dawley rats. After surgery, 5/6 
      nephrectomized rats were given an iron-restricted diet from 1 day to 16 weeks for 
      prevention protocol or from 8 to 16 weeks for rescue protocol. Other CKD rats 
      were given a normal diet. RESULTS: At 16 weeks after surgery, CKD rats developed 
      hypertension and renal damage. Early intervention with iron restriction prevented 
      the development of hypertension and vascular remodeling. By contrast, late 
      intervention with iron restriction did not remarkably ameliorate preexisting 
      hypertension and vascular remodeling in CKD rats. On the contrary, late 
      intervention with iron restriction prevented further progression of preexisting 
      renal damage in CKD rats. Interestingly, iron restriction led to increased 
      urinary sodium and decreased urinary potassium excretions in CKD rats. Moreover, 
      iron restriction markedly attenuated renal expression of nuclear 
      mineralocorticoid receptor and Rac1 activity in CKD rats. CONCLUSION: Iron 
      restriction prevented further deterioration of preexisting renal damage. The 
      beneficial effects of iron restriction on renal damage seem to be associated with 
      inhibition of renal mineralocorticoid receptor signaling.

TI  - Erythrocyte and reticulocyte indices in iron deficiency in chronic kidney 
      disease: comparison of two methods.
PG  - 365-70
LID - 10.1080/00365510802657673 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anaemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      particularly in dialysis patients. The recent European guidelines for anaemia 
      treatment in CKD indicate the percentage of hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) and 
      reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr) calculated by Siemens ADVIA haematology 
      analysers as a useful tool indicating iron deficiency. The aim of this study was 
      to evaluate the agreement between CHr and %HYPO parameters and the reticulocyte 
      haemoglobin equivalent (RET-He) and red blood cell haemoglobin equivalent 
      (RBC-He) calculated by the Sysmex XE-2100 haematology analyser in a cohort of 200 
      dialysis patients referred to the Nephrology Unit of our hospital. Furthermore, 
      we evaluated a new index, the DF-Hypo XE, obtained from haemoglobin (Hb), 
      haematocrit (Hct) and RET-He, provided by the Sysmex XE-2100, as a new potential 
      marker of %HYPO in dialysed patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples 
      collected in EDTA anticoagulant from 200 CKD patients receiving erythropoietin 
      and iron to maintain haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 mg/dL were analysed on 
      both the Siemens ADVIA 2120 and the Sysmex XE-2100 within 2 h of collection. 
      RESULTS: There was good correlation between CHr and RET-He (r = 0.88; p<0.0001), 
      %HYPO and DF-Hypo XE (r = 0.89; p<0.0001) and between RBC-He and CH (r = 0.96; 
      p<0.0001), but there was a lower correlation, even though statistically 
      significant, between RBC-He and %HYPO (r = -0.59; p<0.0001). The Altman-Bland 
      analysis showed a very good level of agreement between CHr and RET-He (mean bias 
      = 1.04 pg), %HYPO and DF-Hypo XE (mean bias = 1.73). Using a cut-off value of 
      29.4 pg for the RET-He and of 10.2 for the DF-Hypo XE, 15 out 17 patients with a 
      CHr <29.0 pg and 9 out 11 patients with a %Hypo <10.0% were respectively 
      correctly identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows good correlation and agreement 
      between CHr and RET-He and between %HYPO and DF-Hypo XE in evaluating CKD 
      patients needing iron support.

TI  - The first study on urinary loss of iron and transferrin in association with 
      proteinuria in dogs with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 154-160
LID - 10.14202/vetworld.2023.154-160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Anemia is an important factor in surviving chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Anemia in CKD is associated with various factors, such as 
      inadequate production of erythropoietin and the availability of iron and its 
      binding protein. Reduced total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and iron 
      concentrations may be related to their urinary loss along with proteinuria. This 
      study aimed to determine the urinary loss of iron and transferrin (TF) in 
      relation to the degree of proteinuria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was 
      performed on 37 dogs with CKD. Dogs were divided according to the severity of 
      proteinuria into two groups based on the mean of urinary protein-creatinine (UPC) 
      ratio into UPC ratio <4 and UPC ratio >4. The hematocrit (HCT), blood 
      chemistries, plasma iron, plasma TF, UPC ratio, urinary iron per creatinine ratio 
      (U-Iron/CR), and urinary TF per creatinine ratio (U-TF/CR) were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Anemia was associated with the severity of renal impairment as 
      demonstrated by reduction of HCT when staging of CKD was higher. Dogs with UPC 
      ratio >4 had higher urinary loss of both U-Iron/CR (p < 0.01) and U-TF/CR (p < 
      0.001) with lower plasma TIBC (p < 0.001). The UPC ratio was positively 
      correlated with both U-Iron/CR (r = 0.710, p < 0.001) and U-TF/CR (r = 0.730, p < 
      0.001) but negatively with TIBC (r = -0.462, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Proteinuria 
      was associated with urinary loss of both iron and TF which may contribute to 
      anemia in CKD.

TI  - Iron supplementation in renal anemia.
PG  - 319-24
AB  - Iron-deficiency frequently develops in patients with chronic kidney disease who 
      are treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). It results in reduced 
      effectiveness of anemia therapy; patients may fail to reach hemoglobin targets or 
      may require excessively large doses of rHuEPO. It has been recognized widely that 
      iron management, monitoring for iron deficiency, and effective iron 
      supplementation forms a core component of anemia therapy. This review discusses 
      the physiology of iron balance, derangements in iron balance in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), and the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency in patients 
      treated with rHuEPO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are iron 
      deficient, even though they may not be anaemic. The Iron and Muscle study aims to 
      evaluate whether iron supplementation reduces symptoms of fatigue, improves 
      muscle metabolism, and leads to enhanced exercise capacity and physical function. 
      We report here the trial design and baseline characteristics. METHODS: This is a 
      prospective, double-blind multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) including 
      75 non-dialysis stage 3-4 CKD patients with iron deficiency but without anaemia. 
      Patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to either: i) intravenous iron therapy, or 
      ii) placebo, with concurrent recruitment of eight CKD non-iron deficient 
      participants and six healthy volunteers. The primary outcome of the study is the 
      six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance between baseline and four-weeks. An 
      additional exercise training programme for patients in both groups was initiated 
      and completed between 4 and 12 weeks, to determine the effect of iron repletion 
      compared to placebo treatment in the context of patients undertaking an exercise 
      programme. Additional secondary outcomes include fatigue, physical function, 
      muscle strength, muscle metabolism, quality of life, resting blood pressure, 
      clinical chemistry, safety and harms associated with the iron therapy 
      intervention and the exercise training intervention, and hospitalisations. All 
      outcomes were conducted at baseline, 4, and 12 weeks, with a nested qualitative 
      study, to investigate the experience of living with iron deficiency and 
      intervention acceptability. The cohort have been recruited and baseline 
      assessments undertaken. RESULTS: Seventy-five individuals were recruited. 44% of 
      the randomised cohort were male, the mean (SD) age was 58 (14) years, and 56% 
      were White. Body mass index was 31 (7) kg/m(2); serum ferritin was 59 (45) μg/L, 
      transferrin saturation was 22 (10) %, and haemoglobin was 125 (12) g/L at 
      randomisation for the whole group. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was 35 
      (12) mL/min/1.73 m(2) and the baseline 6MWT distance was 429 (174) m. CONCLUSION: 
      The results from this study will address a substantial knowledge gap in the 
      effects of intravenous iron therapy, and offer potential clinical treatment 
      options, to improve exercise capacity, physical function, fatigue, and muscle 
      metabolism, for non-dialysis patients with CKD who are iron-deficient but not 
      anaemic. It will also offer insight into the potential novel effects of an 8-week 
      exercise training programme. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT: 2018-000,144-25

TI  - Serum biomarkers of iron stores are associated with worse physical health-related 
      quality of life in nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients with or 
      without anemia.
PG  - 1694-1703

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) is a common condition in nondialysis-dependent 
      chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) patients that is associated with poorer clinical 
      outcomes. However, the effect of ID on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 
      this population is unknown. We analyzed data from a multinational cohort of 
      NDD-CKD Stages 3-5 patients to test the association between transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT) index and ferritin with HRQoL. METHODS: Patients from Brazil 
      (n = 205), France (n = 2015) and the USA (n = 293) in the Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (CKDopps, 2013-2019) were included. We 
      evaluated the association of TSAT and ferritin (and functional and absolute ID, 
      defined as TSAT ≤20% and ferritin ≥300 or <50 ng/mL) on pre-specified HRQoL 
      measures, including the 36-item Kidney Disease Quality of Life physical component 
      summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) as the primary outcomes. Models 
      were adjusted for confounders including hemoglobin (Hb). RESULTS: TSAT ≤15% and 
      ferritin <50 ng/mL and ≥300 ng/mL were associated with worse PCS scores, but not 
      with MCS. Patients with composite TSAT ≤20% and ferritin <50 or ≥300 ng/mL had 
      lower functional status and worse PCS scores than those with a TSAT of 20-30% and 
      ferritin 50-299 ng/mL. Patients with a lower TSAT were less likely to perform 
      intense physical activity. Adjustment for Hb only slightly attenuated the 
      observed effects. CONCLUSIONS: Low TSAT levels, as well as both low TSAT with low 
      ferritin and low TSAT with high ferritin, are associated with worse physical 
      HRQoL in NDD-CKD patients, even after accounting for Hb level. Interventional 
      studies of iron therapy on HRQoL among NDD-CKD individuals are needed to confirm 
      these findings.

      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1035-1041

AB  - Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) which is treated 
      by erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. However, most of the patients do not 
      respond adequately due to the development of functional iron deficiency (FID). 
      The study was conducted to explore the value of inflammatory markers, high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) along with serum 
      ferritin (SF) in the diagnosis of FID. Seventy-seven clinically diagnosed 
      patients of CKD (Stage 3, 4, and 5) of either sex, age >18 years with hemoglobin 
      <11 g/dL were included in the study. Complete hemogram with peripheral smear, 
      serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, SF, transferrin 
      receptors (sTfR), hsCRP, IL-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were estimated 
      and statistically analyzed. sTfR/log ferritin (taken as gold standard) detected 
      31/77 patients as having iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Nineteen patients were 
      detected as having FID. SF at a cut-off <70 μg/L showed the best sensitivity 
      (83.87%) and specificity (73.91%) in detecting FID in these patients and 
      identified 14/19 cases of FID. The 5 FID cases who were missed had raised hsCRP. 
      The presence of raised hsCRP reduced the sensitivity to 79.16%. SF <70 μg/L 
      emerged as the most sensitive and specific in the identification of 
      iron-deficient erythropoiesis. SF >12 μg/L - SF <70 μg/L was able to identify 
      14/19 cases of FID. Furthermore, hsCRP further stratified the subgroup of CKD 
      patients in which FID could be detected with higher sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Impact of intravenous iron on cardiac and skeletal oxidative stress and cardiac 
      mitochondrial function in experimental uraemia chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 442-464
LID - 10.52586/4958 [doi]
AB  - Introuction: Uraemia leads to changes in cardiac structure, metabolic remodeling 
      and anaemia, key factors in the development of heart failure in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease. Previous studies have identified abnormalities in 
      mitochondrial function, potentially impairing energy provision and enhancing 
      oxidative stress. This study characterised oxidant status and changes in 
      mitochondrial function in uraemia and the impact of correcting anaemia via 
      intravenous iron therapy. Methods: Experimental uraemia was induced in male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats via a subtotal nephrectomy and parenteral iron administration 
      given 6 weeks post-surgery. Oxidative stress from tissue samples was evaluated by 
      measuring pro-oxidant activities and anti-oxidant capacities in both sham and 
      uraemic animals with and without iron supplementation. Thiobarbituric 
      acid-reactive substances (TBARS), aconitase activity and cardiolipin were 
      measured. Mitochondrial function was assessed using the Seahorse XFp analyser on 
      isolated mitochondria excised from cardiac tissue. Results: Oxidative stress in 
      this uraemic model was increased in cardiac tissue (increased GSSG/GSH ratio, 
      TBARS and increased activities of pro-oxidant enzymes). There was no impact on 
      skeletal tissue. Parenteral iron ameliorated oxidative stress by enhancing the 
      anti-oxidant defense system in cardiac tissue and skeletal tissue. Examination of 
      respiratory reserve in cardiac mitochondria demonstrated that parenteral iron 
      restored mitochondrial function. This experimental model of uraemia demonstrated 
      a specific oxidative stress on the heart muscle without significant changes in 
      skeletal oxidant status. Iron therapy improved anti-oxidant defence system, 
      consequently reducing oxidative stress in the heart and skeletal tissue. There 
      was an improvement in cardiac mitochondrial function. Conclusions: This 
      experimental evidence indicates that iron therapy could reduce vulnerability to 
      oxidative stress and potentially improve both cardiac and skeletal functional 
      capacity from improvements in mitochondrial function.

LID - 10.1111/jvim.16367 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reticulocyte indices have been suggested as alternatives to 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) for iron status assessment in humans and dogs but 
      they have not been evaluated thoroughly in cats. OBJECTIVES: To assess the value 
      of the reticulocyte indices for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in cats with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic hematuria associated with subcutaneous 
      ureteral bypasses (SUBs). ANIMALS: Sixty-four cats: 16 healthy, 14 CKD without 
      SUB, and 34 CKD with SUB. METHODS: Prospective observational cross-sectional 
      study of cats presented for routine nephrology visits. Primary outcomes included 
      assessment of the diagnostic values of erythrocyte indices (mean corpuscular 
      volume, hemoglobin, and hemoglobin concentration: MCV, MCH, and MCHC) and 
      reticulocyte indices (mean corpuscular volume, MCVr; corpuscular hemoglobin, 
      CHr), using TSAT as reference. RESULTS: Iron deficiency was diagnosed in 9/64 
      cats (14%). A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis yielded a moderate 
      discriminatory value for CHr in this diagnosis: area under the curve [AUC] = .75 
      (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.89); P = .006; sensitivity 67%, specificity 82% 
      for a cutoff of 15.9 pg. This compared favorably to MCVr (AUC = .63; P = .29), 
      MCV (AUC = .58; P = .45), MCH (AUC = .64; P = .19), and MCHC (AUC = .7; P = .03). 
      CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: CHr added moderate value to the diagnosis of 
      iron deficiency in cats with CKD.

TI  - Urinary Iron Excretion is Associated with Urinary Full-Length Megalin and Renal 
      Oxidative Stress in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 458-470
LID - 10.1159/000488470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Megalin mediates the uptake of glomerular-filtered iron in the 
      proximal tubules. Urinary full length megalin (C-megalin) excretion has been 
      found to be increased in association with megalin-mediated metabolic load to the 
      endo-lysosomal system in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) of residual 
      nephrons. In the present study, we investigated the association between urinary 
      iron and C-megalin in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, and the possible 
      harmful effect of iron in renal tubules. METHODS: Urinary levels of iron and 
      C-megalin were measured in 63 CKD patients using automatic absorption 
      spectrometry and a recently-established sandwich ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Although both urinary C-megalin and urinary total protein levels were correlated 
      with urinary iron (C-megalin: ρ = 0.574, p <0.001; total protein: ρ = 0.500, p 
      <0.001, respectively), urinary C-megalin alone emerged as an independent factor 
      positively associated with urinary iron (β = 0.520, p <0.001) (R2 = 0.75, p 
      <0.001). Furthermore, urinary iron was significantly and positively associated 
      with urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, an oxidative stress marker, while no 
      association with other markers of renal tubular injury, i.e., β2-microglobulin 
      and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest 
      that renal iron handling may be associated with megalin-mediated endo-lysosomal 
      metabolic load in PTECs of residual nephrons and oxidative stress in renal 
      tubules.

PG  - 95-99
LID - 10.1159/000337820 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is a significant cause of morbidity and lowers the quality of life of 
      patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron deficiency is the most 
      important cause of erythropoietin (EPO) hyporesponsiveness in CKD. EPO 
      administration significantly increases the costs of CKD management. It follows 
      that paramount importance must be given to enhancing responsiveness to EPO 
      thereby ensuring that the patient derives maximum benefit. Intravenous iron (IVI) 
      administration has been used for decades to replenish body iron stores. Multiple 
      preparations of Iron are available in the market. However, IVI administration is 
      fraught with dangers like adverse drug reactions, susceptibility to infection, 
      and, as recently postulated, direct cellular toxicity. Traditional approaches to 
      IVI administration have focused on multiple administrations of lower doses for 
      fear of adverse reactions. However, recent studies have demonstrated that higher 
      doses can be safely administered in a single infusion, thereby reducing 
      hospitalization costs and patient inconvenience. Newer preparations of IVI are 
      relatively safer, easier to administer and efficacious. Preparations like Iron 
      sucrose, ferumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose and iron isomaltoside do not require 
      test doses and allow higher doses to be administered at a time with cost and 
      effect benefits.

TI  - Iron sucrose: the oldest iron therapy becomes new.
PG  - 1111-21
AB  - Several parenteral iron preparations are now available. This article focuses on 
      iron sucrose, a hematinic, used more widely than any other for more than five 
      decades, chiefly in Europe and now available in North America. Iron sucrose has 
      an average molecular weight of 34 to 60 kd, and after intravenous (IV) 
      administration, it distributes into a volume equal to that of plasma, with a 
      terminal half-life of 5 to 6 hours. Transferrin and ferritin levels can be 
      measured reliably 48 hours after IV administration of this agent. Iron sucrose 
      carries no "black-box" warning, and a test dose is not required before it is 
      administered. Doses of 100 mg can be administered over several minutes, and 
      larger doses up to 300 mg can be administered within 60 minutes. The efficacy of 
      iron sucrose has been shown in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) both 
      before and after the initiation of dialysis therapy. Iron sucrose, like iron 
      gluconate, has been associated with a markedly lower incidence of 
      life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions and may be administered safely to those 
      with previously documented intolerance to iron dextran or iron gluconate. 
      Nonanaphylactoid reactions, including non-life-threatening hypotension, nausea, 
      and exanthema, also are extremely uncommon with iron sucrose. Management of 
      patients with the anemia of CKD mandates that we carefully examine the 
      effectiveness and safety of this oldest of iron preparations and the accumulating 
      present-day data regarding it and contemporaneous agents.

TI  - Effect of intravenous iron on endogenous erythropoietin and FGF-23 secretion in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2164305
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2164305 [doi]
LID - 2164305
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has been observed that intravenous iron administration may 
      suppress endogenous production of erythropoietin (EPO). We postulate that this 
      effect may be mediated by increased FGF-23 secretion. AIM OF THE STUDY: To 
      evaluate the short-term effect of intravenous iron sucrose administration on 
      endogenous EPO secretion in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The cohort comprised 35 nondialysis patients with CKD stages 3-5. 
      All received 100 mg of intravenous iron (III)-hydroxide sucrose complex daily for 
      five consecutive days. Plasma EPO, iFGF-23, cFGF-23, PTH, bone alkaline 
      phosphatase (BAP), phosphorus (PO4), calcium (Ca), and high-sensitive C-reactive 
      protein (CRP) were measured before, and two hours after, the first and third iron 
      infusions, and after completing iron therapy. RESULTS: EPO concentration at the 
      end of iron treatment was significantly lower than two hours after the first iron 
      infusion (p = 0.0003) and before the third dose (p = 0.0006) (12.6 [10.2, 41.4] 
      mIU/mL. vs. 30.9 [15.9, 54.2] mIU/mL and 33.4 [15.4, 56.7] mIU/mL, respectively). 
      Conversely, plasma iFGF-23 was significantly higher before the third dose (61.1 
      [18.6, 420.1 4] pg/mL; p = 0.025) and after the course of treatment (92.1 [28.4, 
      878.1] pg/mL; p = 0.004) compared to pretreatment value (48.4 [16.2, 420] pg/mL). 
      cFGF-23 concentration was significantly lower than baseline after the first iron 
      dose (491.8 [257.7, 1086.3] vs. 339.2 [75.4, 951.2] RU/mL; p = 0.005) and after 
      treatment (398.7 [90.4, 1022.3] RU/mL; p = 0.025). No significant linear 
      correlation was found between changes in plasma EPO and FGF-23. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although intravenous iron therapy causes parallel increase of FGF-23 and 
      supression of endogenous EPO, these two effects seem to be independent.

      these trials suggests that morbidity is higher in subjects who fail to achieve 
      the designated hemoglobin target and are typically exposed to higher doses of 
      ESAs and iron than those that easily achieve the intended targets. Intravenous 
      iron administration circumvents the natural biologic mechanisms for handling and 
      utilization of iron. There is in vitro and in vivo evidence that intravenous iron 
      preparations can cause oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, 
      impaired immunity, and renal injury. Since iron overload is known to promote 
      endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and immune dysfunction which are 
      the leading causes of premature mortality in CKD and ESRD patients, it is 
      imperative to exercise caution with the use of IV iron preparations in this 
      population. The present review is intended to provide a brief overview of the 
      potential adverse effects of the overzealous use of these agents.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.21990 [doi]
AB  - Ferric citrate has been reported to have the potential to reduce phosphate and 
      increase iron availability in patients with chronic kidney disease. In the 
      present study, we evaluated its safety and efficacy in phosphate reduction and 
      iron supplementation in chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 requiring dialysis 
      patients. We systematically searched for clinical trials published in PubMed, 
      Medline, and Cochrane databases. Only randomized controlled trials on the effects 
      of ferric citrate in chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 requiring dialysis patients 
      were selected. The primary outcomes were changes in serum phosphate, calcium, and 
      anemia-related parameters. The secondary outcomes were the adverse effects of 
      ferric citrate. Nine studies providing data on 1755 patients were included in the 
      meta-analysis. Ferric citrate significantly reduced serum phosphate compared with 
      placebo (mean difference, -1.39; 95% confidence interval, -2.12 to -0.66) and had 
      a non-inferior effect compared with active treatment. Furthermore, ferric citrate 
      significantly improved hemoglobin, transferrin saturation and ferritin. Adverse 
      effects of constipation did not differ significantly between ferric citrate and 
      placebo or active treatment. This review provides evidence that ferric citrate 
      effectively alleviates hyperphosphatemia and iron deficiency in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 requiring dialysis patients. However, the 
      included studies did not have cardiovascular complications or mortality 
      information and could not assess whether ferric citrate affected the risk of 
      all-cause death or cardiovascular complications in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. Further studies are required to assess whether the long-term use of 
      ferric citrate can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause 
      mortality.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23, iron and inflammation - are they related in early 
      stages of chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 845-850
LID - 10.5114/aoms.2016.58647 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) levels are elevated in 
      impaired renal function. Inflammation and iron are potential regulators of 
      FGF-23. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between FGF-23 
      concentration, novel iron status biomarkers and inflammatory parameters among 
      patients with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      The study population included 84 patients with CKD in the early stage. Serum 
      hemoglobin, fibrinogen, creatinine, iron, transferrin saturation and ferritin 
      levels were measured using standard laboratory methods. Commercially available 
      kits were used to measure: intact FGF-23, hepcidin, soluble transferrin receptor 
      (sTfR), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). 
      RESULTS: In patients with CKD no differences in FGF-23 concentration according to 
      iron status were observed. Lower iron concentration was associated with higher 
      concentrations of hsCRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen. In univariate and multivariate 
      analysis FGF-23 correlated with fibrinogen (r = -0.23, p < 0.05) and eGFR (r = 
      -0.36, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: FGF-23 is affected by kidney function and 
      fibrinogen but not iron status parameters in the early stages of CKD. Our data 
      are paving the way for further studies on the role of FGF-23 in iron metabolism, 
      especially in early stages of CKD.

TI  - Iron accumulation in human chronic renal disease.
PG  - 580-4
AB  - Iron, which has been shown to accumulate within proximal tubule lysosomes in 
      proteinuric models of renal disease, may play a role in the progression of 
      chronic renal disease by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, 
      renal biopsies from humans with proteinuria and/or chronic renal failure were 
      examined at an ultrastructural level for iron by energy dispersive analysis and 
      compared with normal biopsies. Iron accumulated in proximal tubular lysosomes in 
      renal disease (P < 0.05 v normals), accompanied in some cases by phosphorus and 
      silicon. Both the number of iron-containing lysosomes per tubular cross-section 
      (1.86 +/- 0.41 v 0.66 +/- 0.22, P < 0.05) and the mean concentration of lysosomal 
      iron (254.5 +/- 73.4 mg/dL v 81.2 +/- 23.8, P < 0.001) was greater in patients 
      with nephrotic syndrome (n = 12) than in those without (n = 8). Iron accumulation 
      (number of iron-containing lysosomes/tubule) correlated with protein excretion (r 
      = 0.68, P = 0.003, n = 20), but not with glomerular filtration rate. Damaged 
      tubules contained greater amounts of iron than tubules with less damage (288.5 
      +/- 68.5 mg/dL v 80.4 +/- 13.9, P < 0.01). Further studies are needed to define 
      the possible role of iron in causing tubular damage and progression of renal 
      disease.

TI  - Assessment of iron deficiency anaemia and its risk factors among adults with 
      chronic kidney disease in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.
PG  - 197-203
LID - 10.4103/npmj.npmj_106_18 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A substantial proportion of patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) develop iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Despite the association of IDA with 
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes, it remains underdiagnosed and poorly managed. Up 
      to 70% of patients with CKD are anaemic at the time of initiating dialysis, while 
      the predictors of IDA in these patients in our setting are unknown. This study 
      aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for IDA in patients with CKD. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a case-control study of 157 patients with CKD and 
      157 age and gender matched subjects without CKD. Information obtained from the 
      participants were socio-demographic details, aetiology of CKD, medication history 
      and features of IDA. All participants had serum ferritin, total iron binding 
      capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TSAT), highly sensitive C-reactive 
      protein, serum creatinine and complete blood count determined. RESULTS: The 
      median estimated glomerular rate (22.7 [3.4-59.5] vs. 110.2 [60.3-152.8] 
      ml/min/1.73 m(2), P < 0.01), the mean haemoglobin concentration (9.3 ± 2.6 vs. 
      11.4 ± 1.7 g/dl, P < 0.01), and TSAT (27.9% ± 6.4% vs. 34.8% ± 8.1%, P < 0.04) 
      were significantly lower in patients with CKD. The mean age, serum ferritin and 
      TIBC were similar in both groups. The prevalence of absolute (24.8% vs. 13.4%, P 
      < 0.01) and relative (17.8% vs. 7.6%, P < 0.01) iron deficiencies were higher 
      among individuals with CKD compared to the controls. Female gender (odd ratio 
      [OR]:1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.0267-4.1163, P < 0.04) and severity of 
      CKD (OR: 3.43, 95% CI: 1.5568-7.8324, P < 0.02) were independently associated 
      with IDA. CONCLUSION: IDA is common among individuals with CKD while female 
      gender and severity of CKD were factors that independently predicted IDA.

TI  - The uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate interferes with iron metabolism by regulating 
      hepcidin in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 586-597
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepcidin secreted by hepatocytes is a key regulator of iron 
      metabolism throughout the body. Hepcidin concentrations are increased in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), contributing to abnormalities in iron metabolism. Levels of 
      indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin, are also elevated in CKD. However, the 
      effect of IS accumulation on iron metabolism remains unclear. METHODS: We used 
      HepG2 cells to determine the mechanism by which IS regulates hepcidin 
      concentrations. We also used a mouse model of adenine-induced CKD. The CKD mice 
      were divided into two groups: one was treated using AST-120 and the other 
      received no treatment. We examined control mice, CKD mice, CKD mice treated using 
      AST-120 and mice treated with IS via drinking water. RESULTS: In the in vitro 
      experiments using HepG2 cells, IS increased hepcidin expression in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Silencing of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) inhibited 
      IS-induced hepcidin expression. Furthermore, IS induced oxidative stress and 
      antioxidant drugs diminished IS-induced hepcidin expression. Adenine-induced CKD 
      mice demonstrated an increase in hepcidin concentrations; this increase was 
      reduced by AST-120, an oral adsorbent of the uremic toxin. CKD mice showed renal 
      anemia, decreased plasma iron concentration, increased plasma ferritin and 
      increased iron content in the spleen. Ferroportin was decreased in the duodenum 
      and increased in the spleen. These changes were ameliorated by AST-120 treatment. 
      Mice treated by direct IS administration showed hepatic hepcidin upregulation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IS affects iron metabolism in CKD by participating in hepcidin 
      regulation via pathways that depend on AhR and oxidative stress.

TI  - Acute Effects of Iron Sucrose and Iron Carboxymaltose on Endothelial Function in 
      Nondialysis Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.
PG  - e175-e181
LID - 10.1097/MJT.0000000000001091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron is commonly prescribed in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) patients. Iron sucrose (IS) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) are 2 
      frequently used formulations. Experimental data showed that this 2 intravenous 
      iron preparations have different potential to induce oxidative stress and by that 
      endothelial dysfunction. Still, direct comparisons in clinical settings are 
      rather scarce. STUDY QUESTION: Are there any acute changes in endothelial 
      function after single intravenous iron infusions of IS and FCM in nondialysis CKD 
      patients? STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, crossover study in which 31 
      patients with CKD stages 3-5 (80% stages 3 and 4, 81% female, 55% older than 60 
      years, 23% diabetes mellitus, and 94% arterial hypertension) who required 
      intravenous iron as part of their routine medical care were enrolled. MEASURES 
      AND OUTCOMES: The effect of flow-mediated vasodilatation infusions containing 
      250-mL 10% glucose, 500-mg FCM, and 200-mg IS, both in 250-mL 0.9% saline 
      solution, was compared. The infusions were administered over 30 minutes, 72 hours 
      apart, in the mentioned order. Ultrasound measurement of the brachial artery 
      flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) performed 15 minutes before and after each 
      infusion was used to assess endothelial function. The outcome was the 
      post/preinfusion difference (Δ) in FMD. RESULTS: The baseline FMD was similar 
      before each study intervention. The arterial reactivity significantly decreased 
      only after IS infusion [ΔFMD -2.3 (-5.65 to -0.33) vs. 1.0 (-1.49 to 1.80) after 
      glucose, P = 0.01], but not after FCM [ΔFMD -0.8 (-2.50 to 0.65), P = 0.27 vs. 
      glucose]. Moreover, the arterial reactivity was higher after IS as compared to 
      FCM. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial dysfunction seems to be acutely induced by a single 
      dose of intravenous IS, but not by FCM, in nondialysis CKD patients.

TI  - Erythrocyte and reticulocyte indices in the assessment of erythropoiesis activity 
      and iron availability.
PG  - 144-9
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12013 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Consequence of the imbalance between the erythroid marrow iron 
      requirements and the actual supply is a reduction in red cell hemoglobin content, 
      which causes hypochromic mature red cells and reticulocytes. Sysmex XE 5000 
      analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) reports reticulocyte hemoglobin 
      equivalent (Ret-He) and the percentages of erythrocyte subsets, including the 
      hypochromic fraction (%Hypo-He). We study the value of these parameters of 
      hemoglobinization in the evaluation of erythropoiesis and iron availability. 
      METHODS: Ninety healthy subjects, 85 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      and 65 patients on dialysis (HD) receiving therapy and 91 patients with iron 
      deficiency (IDA) were analyzed. Pearson's correlation, t-test for independent, 
      and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were utilized. 
      RESULTS: The results in the IDA group reflected the state of iron depletion (low 
      ferritin), low iron availability (low MCH and high percentage of hypochromic red 
      cells (%Hypo-He)), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (low Ret-He). In the HD and 
      CKD, the reticulocyte percentage showed the increased erythropoiesis, maintained 
      due to treatment (Ret-He over 30 pg) and good iron availability, MCH within 
      reference range and %Hypo-He slightly increased. The results of ROC curves 
      analysis for the diagnosis of iron deficiency (gold standard sTfR > 21 nm) were 
      as follows: Ret-He area under curve (AUC) 0.935 cutoff 29.8 pg, sensitivity 
      90.7%, specificity 83.1%. % Hypo-He AUC 0.925 cutoff 3.5%, sensitivity 87.3%, 
      specificity 88.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage of hypochromic red cells and Ret-He 
      provide information about individual cell characteristics, so the hypochromic 
      cells are detected and quantitated improving the evaluation of erythropoiesis and 
      iron status.

TI  - Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for the treatment of anemia in CKD: 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 897-906
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2008.05.033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron supplementation is essential for the treatment of patients with 
      anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is not clear which is the best method 
      of iron administration. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. A 
      search was performed until January 2008 of MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference lists of 
      included trials. SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD (stages III to V). We 
      included dialysis patients and patients with CKD not on dialysis therapy 
      (hereafter referred to as patients with CKD). SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: We 
      included all randomized controlled trials regardless of publication status or 
      language. INTERVENTION: Intravenous (IV) versus oral iron supplementation. 
      OUTCOMES MEASURES: Primary outcomes assessed: absolute hemoglobin (Hb) level or 
      change in Hb level from baseline. We also assessed all-cause mortality, 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agent requirement, adverse events, ferritin level, and 
      need for renal replacement therapy in patients with CKD. RESULTS: 13 trials were 
      identified, 6 including patients with CKD and 7 including dialysis patients. 
      Compared with oral iron, there was a significantly greater Hb level in dialysis 
      patients treated with IV iron (weighted mean difference, 0.83 g/dL; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.09 to 1.57). Meta-regression showed a positive association 
      between Hb level increase and IV iron dose administered and a negative 
      association with baseline Hb level. For patients with CKD, there was a small but 
      significant difference in Hb level favoring the IV iron group (weighted mean 
      difference, 0. 31 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0. 53). Data for 
      all-cause mortality were sparse, and there was no difference in adverse events 
      between the IV- and oral-treated patients. LIMITATIONS: There was significant 
      heterogeneity between trials. Follow-up was limited to 2 to 3 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that patients on hemodialysis therapy have better 
      Hb level response when treated with IV iron. For patients with CKD, this effect 
      is small.

TI  - Effects of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors on iron 
      regulation in non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients with anemia: 
      A systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - Phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies showed that hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl 
      hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) efficiently increased hemoglobin levels in both 
      dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. However, the effects of HIF-PHIs on iron regulation have not been 
      consistent among clinical trials. We performed a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of six 
      HIF-PHIs on iron regulation in non-dialysis CKD patients. Electronic databases 
      were searched from inception to April 20, 2020, for eligible studies. Changes 
      from baseline in transferrin saturation (TSAT), total iron-binding capacity 
      (TIBC), iron, ferritin, and hepcidin levels were pooled using the 
      inverse-variance method and presented as the mean difference (MD) or standardized 
      MD (SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis of the included 
      studies showed that, in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, HIF-PHIs decreased 
      TSAT (MD, -4.51; 95 % CI, -5.81 to -3.21), ferritin (MD, -47.29; 95 % CI, -54.59 
      to -40.00) and hepcidin (SMD, -0.94; 95 % CI, -1.25 to -0.62), increased TIBC 
      (MD, 9.15; 95 % CI, 7.08-11.22), and did not affect serum iron (MD, -0.31; 95 % 
      CI, -2.05 to 1.42) despite enhanced erythropoiesis. This systematic review 
      suggests that HIF-PHIs promote iron utilization in non-dialysis-dependent CKD 
      patients. Importantly, HIF-PHIs are associated with increased transferrin levels 
      (and TIBC), leading to reduced TSAT. Therefore, the reduction of TSAT after 
      HIF-PHIs should not be interpreted as iron deficiency.

AB  - Aim Anaemia (particularly iron deficiency) is of important concern in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as it reflects the outcome of the disease. 
      Current recommendations for the use of intravenous iron (IV) therapy in the 
      management of anaemia in such patients are limited. This study highlights the 
      comparison of oral to intravenous iron in patients with chronic kidney disease. 
      Materials and methods This is a prospective case-control study comparing 
      intravenous iron to oral iron in chronic kidney disease patients admitted to the 
      Medicine Department of Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, in central India from 
      October 2018 to October 2020. A total of 150 patients were divided into two 
      groups of 75 each, one receiving oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg tablets) and 
      the other intravenous iron (IV iron sucrose). Results Serum iron, serum ferritin, 
      and transferrin saturation (TS) showed increased levels in the IV iron group than 
      in the oral iron group. In the IV group, a statistically significant increase was 
      found in haemoglobin levels after therapy among all stages of kidney disease 
      (p<0.05) while the same was not reported in the oral iron group. Conclusion IV 
      iron sucrose therapy had been found to be effective, well-tolerated, and more 
      successful than oral iron treatment in chronic kidney disease patients as far as 
      the parameter of iron deficiency anaemia is concerned.

AB  - Ferric citrate (FC) is an approved therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients as a phosphate (Pi) binder for dialysis-dependent CKD, and for iron 
      deficiency anemia (IDA) in non-dialysis CKD. Elevated Pi and IDA both lead to 
      increased FGF23, however, the roles of iron and FGF23 during CKD remain unclear. 
      To this end, iron and Pi metabolism were tested in a mouse model of CKD (0.2% 
      adenine) ± 0.5% FC for 6 weeks, with and without osteocyte deletion of Fgf23 
      (flox-Fgf23/Dmp1-Cre). Intact FGF23 (iFGF23) increased in all CKD mice but was 
      lower in Cre(+) mice with or without FC, thus the Dmp1-Cre effectively reduced 
      FGF23. Cre(+) mice fed AD-only had higher serum Pi than Cre(-) pre- and 
      post-diet, and the Cre(+) mice had higher BUN regardless of FC treatment. Total 
      serum iron was higher in all mice receiving FC, and liver Tfrc, Bmp6, and 
      hepcidin mRNAs were increased regardless of genotype; liver IL-6 showed decreased 
      mRNA in FC-fed mice. The renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) anabolic enzyme 
      Cyp27b1 had higher mRNA and the catabolic Cyp24a1 showed lower mRNA in FC-fed 
      mice. Finally, mice with loss of FGF23 had higher bone cortical porosity, whereas 
      Raman spectroscopy showed no changes in matrix mineral parameters. Thus, FC- and 
      FGF23-dependent and -independent actions were identified in CKD; loss of FGF23 
      was associated with higher serum Pi and BUN, demonstrating that FGF23 was 
      protective of mineral metabolism. In contrast, FC maintained serum iron and 
      corrected inflammation mediators, potentially providing ancillary benefit.

AB  - Safety of parenteral iron therapy is critical and has been demonstrated in 
      several studies, but concerns persist on safety. We performed a retrospective 
      single-center study investigating the safety and efficacy of parenteral iron 
      administration using 2 iron preparations-Monofer and Cosmofer (Pharmacosmos A/S, 
      Holbaek, Denmark)-in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), on peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD) and non-dialysis. A database of CKD patients receiving intravenous 
      (IV) iron was analyzed. Side effects were recorded during infusion, 
      post-infusion, and after 48 hours. In a population of CKD patients (non-dialysis 
      and PD), IV iron is safe with few major adverse effects for these 2 IV iron 
      preparations studied with similar dosing schedules. These data provide 
      reassurance on the relative short-term safety of IV iron preparations regarding 
      acute infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions.

TI  - Proinflammatory effects of iron sucrose in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1259-63
AB  - Inflammation is a central component of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      Iron promotes oxidative stress and inflammatory response in animals and promotes 
      progressive CKD. Parenteral iron provokes oxidative stress in patients with CKD; 
      however, its potential to provoke an inflammatory response is unknown. In 20 
      veterans with CKD, 100 mg iron sucrose was administered intravenously over 5 min 
      and urinary excretion rate and plasma concentration of monocyte chemoattractant 
      protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured at timed intervals over 24 h. Patients were then 
      randomized to placebo or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) 600 mg b.i.d. and the experiment 
      was repeated at 1 week. Iron sucrose markedly increased plasma concentration and 
      urinary excretion rate of MCP-1 at baseline and at 1 week visits (P < 0.0001 for 
      time effect). Urinary excretion peaked at 30 min and plasma concentration at 15 
      min. Plasma MCP-1 concentration fell from 164 +/- 17.7 to 135 +/- 17.7 pg/ml with 
      NAC, whereas it remained unchanged from 133 +/- 12.5 to 132 +/- 17.7 pg/ml with 
      placebo (P=0.001 for visit x antioxidant drug interaction). There was a reduction 
      in MCP-1 urinary excretion rate from visit 1 to 2. At the baseline visit, the 
      urinary excretion rate averaged 305 +/- 66 pg/min and at the second visit 245 +/- 
      67 pg/min (mean difference 60 +/- 28 pg/min, P = 0.030). There was no improvement 
      in urinary MCP-1 excretion with NAC. In conclusion, iron sucrose causes rapid and 
      transient generation and/or release of MCP-1 plasma concentration and increases 
      urinary excretion rate, and systemic MCP-1 level but the urinary excretion rate 
      is not abrogated with the antioxidant NAC. These results may have implications 
      for the progression of CKD with parenteral iron.

AB  - Patients with chronic inflammatory conditions including chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and heart failure (HF) are undertreated with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). 
      Progressive inflammation and reduced iron transport associated with CKD and HF 
      may reduce the efficacy of oral iron therapy. Oral ferric citrate improves anemia 
      markers in CKD, but its effects in patients with CKD and concomitant HF have not 
      been described. Patients with CKD not on dialysis and IDA from a phase 2 and 3 
      trial were treated with ferric citrate (n = 190) or placebo (n = 188); patients 
      with HF were identified from medical histories. Hemoglobin response was defined 
      as a ≥10.0-g/L increase in hemoglobin. Changes in hemoglobin, transferrin 
      saturation, ferritin, and serum phosphate from baseline to week 12 and the 
      incidence of adverse events potentially related to HF were evaluated. HF was 
      reported in 22% (n = 81) of patients. The proportion of patients with hemoglobin 
      response to ferric citrate treatment did not significantly differ in patients 
      with and without HF (43% vs 49%, respectively; p = 0.47); changes from baseline 
      in hemoglobin, iron parameters, and serum phosphate were similar. Adverse events 
      potentially related to HF were noted more frequently in patients with HF (ferric 
      citrate, 23%; placebo, 17%) versus those without HF (ferric citrate, 12%; 
      placebo, 11%). In conclusion, these results indicate a potential role for ferric 
      citrate in the treatment of IDA in patients with CKD not on dialysis and 
      concomitant HF.

PG  - 52-7
AB  - In the review paper an issue of the administration of iron containing drugs in 
      the treatment of anemia in non-dialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) is presented. Iron deficiency in patients with CKD (serum ferritin 
      concentration below 100 ng/ml, transferrin saturation below 20%) occurs in 20-70% 
      of cases. Prevalence of iron deficiency depends on stage of CKD and patients' 
      gender. Among causes of iron deficiency the following reasons are mentioned: 
      blood loss through gastrointestinal tract (17-18% of patients in pre-dialysis 
      stage show positive results of tests on occult blood), diminished absorption 
      (uremic gastroenteropathy, administration of drugs decreasing iron absorption), 
      decreased delivery of food (anorexia, low protein diet), infections and 
      inflammatory state. In the course of infections and inflammatory states body iron 
      storage may be normal, but its utilization for erythropoesis is deteriorated 
      (functional iron deficiency). Results of randomized controlled studies indicate 
      greater efficiency of intravenous therapy in comparison with oral route of iron 
      administration. In practice, the main route of administration of iron-containing 
      drugs to non-dialyzed patients with CKD remains, however, the oral one (iron 
      sulfate, iron fumarate, hem iron) as more convenient and seldom leading to 
      serious side effects. Intravenous iron therapy (iron dextrose, iron polymaltose, 
      sodium-iron gluconate, iron sucrose) is required for cases with absolute 
      deficiency of this microelement, disturbed intestinal absorption, poor tolerance 
      of oral iron medication or its ineffectiveness from other reasons. Administration 
      of erythropoiesis stimulating agents in predialysis period may require 
      intravenous iron therapy because of enhanced consumption of its stores for 
      erythropoiesis. Attention should be paid to possible nephrotoxic effects of 
      administration of iron containing drugs (transient proteinuria, damage of renal 
      tubules, decrease in glomerular filtration rate).

AB  - In the setting of normal kidney function, iron deficiency is associated with 
      increased FGF23 production and cleavage, altering circulating FGF23 levels. Our 
      objective was to determine how chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dietary iron 
      intake affect FGF23 production and metabolism in wild-type (WT) and hepcidin 
      knockout (HKO) mice. For 8 wk, the mice were fed diets that contained adenine (to 
      induce CKD) or no adenine (control group), with either low-iron (4 ppm) or 
      standard-iron (335 ppm) concentrations. The low-iron diet induced iron deficiency 
      anemia in both the WT and HKO mice. Among the WT mice, in both the control and 
      CKD groups, a low-iron compared with a standard-iron diet increased bone Fgf23 
      mRNA expression, C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) levels, and FGF23 cleavage as 
      manifested by a lower percentage intact FGF23 (iFGF23). Independent of iron 
      status, CKD was associated with inhibition of FGF23 cleavage. Similar results 
      were observed in the HKO control and CKD groups. Dietary iron content was more 
      influential on FGF23 parameters than the presence or absence of hepcidin. In the 
      CKD mice (WT and HKO, total n = 42), independent of the effects of serum 
      phosphate, iron deficiency was associated with increased FGF23 production but 
      also greater cleavage, whereas worse kidney function was associated with 
      increased FGF23 production but decreased cleavage. Therefore, in both the WT and 
      HKO mouse models, dietary iron content and CKD affected FGF23 production and 
      metabolism.

AB  - Despite interest in the clinical implications of soluble transferrin receptor 
      (sTfR), previous studies on the association of sTfR with mortality in the general 
      population are lacking. Therefore, we analysed the association between sTfR and 
      all-cause mortality in the general United States adult population. We conducted a 
      prospective cohort study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      data from 2003 to 2010. A total of 5403 premenopausal nonpregnant females were 
      analysed in this study. The mean age was 34.2 years (range 20.0-49.9 years). 
      Participants were divided into log(sTfR) tertiles. The primary outcome was 
      all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome was chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      development (composite of estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 
      m(2) and/or random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g). During a median 
      8.7 years of follow-up, 103 (1.9%) participants died. Compared with the reference 
      group (log(sTfR) 0.45-0.57), the highest tertile of log(sTfR) was associated with 
      all-cause mortality (log(sTfR) > 0.57, hazard ratio [HR] 1.77 [95% CI 1.05-2.98]) 
      in a multivariable hazards model including covariates such as haemoglobin and 
      ferritin. Patients in the highest tertile of log(sTfR) also had an increased risk 
      of CKD relative to those in the reference tertile. High sTfR was associated with 
      all-cause mortality and CKD regardless of anaemia and iron storage status.

TI  - TMPRSS6 rs855791 polymorphism and susceptibility to iron deficiency anaemia in 
      non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients in South Africa.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In genome-wide studies, there is a strong association between the 
      TMPRSS6 allele A736V (rs855791) and significantly lower levels of serum iron, 
      transferrin saturation, haemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volumes. The influence 
      of this genetic variant on susceptibility to iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is unknown. METHODS: In this 
      cross-sectional study, we measured the full blood count and TMPRSS6 T>C 
      polymorphism in black adult participants (n=260) with CKD and healthy controls 
      (n=146) at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa. 
      RESULTS: The overall prevalence of anaemia in the CKD and control population was 
      46.9% and 19.6% respectively. Twenty-six per cent of CKD participants were iron 
      deficient. The prevalence of rs855791 C homozygosity was similar among iron 
      deficient and non-iron deficient anaemia groups (86.1% vs 84.2%, P=0.723). When 
      the analysis was confined to subjects with or without functional iron deficiency 
      anaemia, C homozygote (88.3% vs 84.4%, P=0.425) was similar for both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that homozygosity for TMPRSS6 rs855791 C genotype 
      does not influence IDA in non-dialysis CKD patients in our population.

TI  - Evaluation of Iron Status in Patients of Chronic Kidney Disease - A Study to 
      Assess the Best Indicators Including Serum Transferrin Receptor Assay.
PG  - 248-253
LID - 10.4103/ijn.IJN_159_18 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is an early complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The iron 
      deficiency is an important contributor, more so in the Indian population. As 
      routine standalone iron tests do not accurately reflect the actual status in the 
      complex environment of CKD, there is a need to study better indicators. Serum 
      iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and serum transferrin 
      receptor (sTfR) levels were estimated in 100 primary iron deficiency anemia (IDA) 
      patients (controls-Group 1) and 68 newly diagnosed CKD cases. The CKD patients 
      were divided into two groups: Serum ferritin <=100 μg/L (Group 2) and >100 μg/L 
      (Group 3). The values of percentage saturation, log of ferritin (log_ferritin), 
      and the ratio of sTfR to log ferritin (sTfR/log_f or sTfR index) were calculated. 
      The CKD cases were further divided depending on ferritin cut-offs of 30, 50, 70, 
      and 100 μg/L and statistically analyzed including ROC and AUC, to choose the best 
      diagnostic parameter for accurate assessment of iron status in CKD cases. The 
      mean serum ferritin was 11.34 μg/L, 28.70 μg/L, and 281.81 μg/L, and the mean 
      sTfR was 2.34 μg/ml, 1.82 μg/ml, and 1.28 μg/ml in Groups 1, 2, and 3. Among all 
      groups, the difference was found to be significant for serum iron, log_ferritin, 
      and sTfR/log_f. The sTfR and sTfR/log_f showed good discrimination between IDA 
      and Anemia of chronic disease in CKD cases, but sTfR/log_f gave the best 
      discrimination at all cut-off levels of ferritin. At a ferritin cut-off of 50 
      μg/L, the sTfR/log_f value of 0.83 had a sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 
      95.45%, and at a ferritin cut-off 100 μg/L, the same value of 0.83 had a 
      sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 86.5%. The ratio of sTfR/log_f is the 
      best indicator for assessing iron status in CKD.

TI  - NIMO-CKD-UK: a real-world, observational study of iron isomaltoside in patients 
      with iron deficiency anaemia and chronic kidney disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron is often used to treat iron deficiency anaemia in 
      non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD), but the optimal dosing regimen 
      remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous 
      iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in 
      iron-deficient ND-CKD patients. METHODS: This real-world, prospective, 
      observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia 
      in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were 
      followed for ≥12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined 
      at the investigators' discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for 
      retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron 
      during Course 1 and those who received ≤1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through 
      adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was 
      significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the ≤1000 mg group 
      (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); 
      p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the 
      ≤1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). 
      Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different 
      between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 
      appointments per 100 patients compared to ≤1000 mg. No serious adverse drug 
      reactions were reported. Of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron in this 
      study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The >1000 mg iron 
      isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater 
      haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, 
      and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the ≤1000 mg 
      regimen. Many of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron were eligible for 
      >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study. TRIAL

TI  - Association between renal iron accumulation and renal interstitial fibrosis in a 
      rat model of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 463-70
LID - 10.1038/hr.2015.14 [doi]
AB  - Iron accumulation is associated with the pathophysiology of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Renal fibrosis is a final common feature that contributes to the 
      progression of CKD; however, little is known about the association between renal 
      iron accumulation and renal interstitial fibrosis in CKD. Here we investigate the 
      effects of iron chelation on renal interstitial fibrosis in a rat model of CKD. 
      CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in Sprague-Dawley rats. At 8 weeks after 
      operation, 5/6 nephrectomized rats were administered an oral iron chelator, 
      deferasirox (DFX), in chow for 8 weeks. Other CKD rats were given a normal diet. 
      Sham-operative rats given a normal diet served as a control. CKD rats exhibited 
      hypertension, glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis. Iron chelation 
      with DFX did not change hypertension and glomerulosclerosis; however, renal 
      interstitial fibrosis was attenuated in CKD rats. Consistent with these findings, 
      renal gene expression of collagen type III and transforming growth factor-β was 
      increased in CKD rats compared with the controls, while iron chelation suppressed 
      these increments. In addition, a decrease in vimentin along an increase in 
      E-cadherin in renal gene expression was observed in CKD rats with iron chelation. 
      CKD rats also showed increased CD68-positive cells in the kidney, whereas its 
      increase was attenuated by iron deprivation. Similarly, increased renal gene 
      expression of CD68, tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant 
      protein-1 was suppressed in CKD rats with iron chelation. Renal iron accumulation 
      seems to be associated with renal interstitial fibrosis in a rat model of CKD.

TI  - Hepcidin and GDF-15 are potential biomarkers of iron deficiency anaemia in 
      chronic kidney disease patients in South Africa.
PG  - 415

LID - 415
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common presenting feature among patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and it is associated with poor clinical outcomes and quality 
      of life. It is not clear if growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) or hepcidin 
      are useful as early markers of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) among non-dialysis 
      CKD patients. We therefore evaluated the diagnostic validity of GDF-15 and 
      hepcidin as biomarkers of IDA among non-dialysis CKD patients in Johannesburg, 
      South Africa. METHOD: An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted among 
      non-dialysis CKD patients (n = 312) and apparently healthy controls (n = 184) 
      from June to December 2016 at an Academic Hospital, in Johannesburg, South 
      Africa. An interviewer administered proforma was used to obtain the 
      socio-biological and clinical characteristics of the participants. Serum levels 
      of GDF-15 and hepcidin were determined. Predictive logistic regression models 
      were built and post estimation receiver operator characteristics were determined 
      to evaluate diagnostic validity of hepcidin and GDF-15 for absolute and 
      functional iron deficiency anaemia. RESULTS: About half (50.6%) of the 
      participants were female while the participants' mean age was 49.7 ± 15.8 years. 
      The predictive value of diagnosing absolute IDA among CKD patients using GDF-15 
      was 74.02% (95% CI: 67.62-80.42%) while the predictive value of diagnosing 
      functional IDA among CKD patients using hepcidin was 70.1% (95% CI: 
      62.79-77.49%).There was a weak negative correlation between hepcidin levels and 
      GFR (r = - 0.19, p = 0.04) in anaemic CKD patients, and between serum GDF-15 and 
      haemoglobin (r = - 0.34, p = 0.001). Serum ferritin (β = 0.00389, 
      P-value< 0.001), was a predictor of log hepcidin. MCHC (β = - 0.0220, P-value 
      0.005) and CKD stage (β = 0.4761, P-value < 0.001), race (β = 0.3429, 
      P-value = 0.018) were predictors of log GDF-15. Both GDF-15 (adj OR: 1.0003, 
      95%CI: 1.0001-1.0005, P = 0.017) and hepcidin (adj OR: 1.003, 95%CI: 
      1.0004-1.0055, P = 0.023) were associated with iron deficiency anaemia after 
      multiple linear regression modelling. CONCLUSION: Serum GDF-15 is a potential 
      biomarker of absolute IDA, while hepcidin levels can predict functional IDA among 
      CKD patients.

TI  - The Association between Iron Deficiency and Renal Outcomes Is Modified by Sex and 
      Anemia in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 1-4.
LID - 10.3390/jpm13030521 [doi]
LID - 521
AB  - Iron deficiency is prevalent in women and patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). Iron deficiency is not only related to anemia but contributes to adverse 
      consequences for the kidney as well. Whether iron status is associated with renal 
      outcomes after considering sex and anemia in patients with CKD stage 1-4 is 
      unclear. Thus, we investigated the association of iron or iron saturation with 
      renal outcomes in a CKD cohort. During a follow-up of 8.2 years, 781 (31.2%) 
      patients met the composite renal outcome of renal replacement therapy and a 50% 
      decline in renal function. In linear regression, iron was associated with sex, 
      hemoglobin (Hb), and nutritional markers. In a fully adjusted Cox regression 
      model, the male patients with normal iron had a significantly decreased risk of 
      renal outcomes (hazard ratio (HR) 0.718; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.579 to 
      0.889), but the female patients did not exhibit this association. The non-anemic 
      patients (Hb ≥ 11 g/dL) had a decreased risk of renal outcomes (HR 0.715; 95% CI 
      0.568 to 0.898), but the anemic patients did not. In the sensitivity analysis, 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) showed similar results. When comparing iron and 
      TSAT, both indicators showed similar prognostic values. In conclusion, iron 
      deficiency, indicated by either iron or iron saturation, was associated with poor 
      renal outcomes in the male or non-anemic patients with CKD stage 1-4.

TI  - Intravenous iron, inflammation, and oxidative stress: is iron a friend or an 
      enemy of uremic patients?
PG  - 40-5
AB  - Intravenous iron supplementation is a recognized therapy for anemia in chronic 
      hemodialysis patients, especially in those treated with erythropoietin. The vast 
      majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be iron-deficient, 
      as evaluated by the usual parameters and by iron staining on bone marrow biopsy, 
      because of multiple forms of interference with all phases of iron metabolism. The 
      need for iron supplementation in CKD patients becomes obvious. Intravenous iron 
      was demonstrated to be superior to oral iron in hemodialysis patients. There is 
      also evidence for the superiority of intravenous iron in peritoneal dialysis and 
      in nondialysis-dependent CKD patients. On the other hand, intravenous iron could 
      promote cytotoxicity and tissue injury, and exacerbate oxidative stress and thus 
      endothelial dysfunction, as well as inflammation and the progression of both CKD 
      and cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, correction of anemia is effective in 
      reducing oxidative stress and, consequently, cardiovascular risk. The overall 
      risk-benefit ratio favors the use of intravenous iron alone or with an 
      erythropoietic stimulating agent in the management of renal anemia. Clinical 
      judgment is necessary in each individual case to diagnose iron deficiency and 
      effectively use intravenous iron.

TI  - The comparative effects of intravenous iron on oxidative stress and inflammation 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency: a randomized 
      controlled pilot study.
PG  - 89-98
LID - 10.23876/j.krcp.20.120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns exist regarding the pro-oxidant and inflammatory potential 
      of intravenous (IV) iron due to labile plasma iron (LPI) generation. This 
      IRON-CKD trial compared the effects of different IV irons on oxidative stress and 
      inflammation. METHODS: In this randomized open-label explorative single-center 
      study in the United Kingdom, non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients with iron deficiency were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive a single 
      infusion of 200 mg iron dextran, or 200 mg iron sucrose (IS), or 200 mg or 1,000 
      mg ferric derisomaltose (FDI) and were followed up for 3 months. The primary 
      outcomes measured were induction of oxidative stress and inflammation. 
      Secondarily, efficacy, vascular function, quality of life, and safety were 
      monitored. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. No significant rise in 
      oxidative stress existed, regardless of preparation or dose. There was a 
      significant rise in LPI with 1,000 mg FDI at 2 hours that normalized within a 
      week, not impacting oxidative stress or inflammation. A delayed rise in 
      C-reactive protein was noted with IS. High-dose FDI produced a sustained serum 
      ferritin increase (mean ± standard error of the mean of predose: 69.1 ± 18.4 
      μg/L, 3 months: 271.0 ± 83.3 μg/L; p = 0.007). Hemoglobin remained stable 
      throughout. No adverse drug reactions were recorded during the study. CONCLUSION: 
      A single dose of IV iron in CKD patients does not trigger oxidative stress or 
      inflammation biomarkers. Third-generation IV irons have a reassuring safety 
      profile, and high-dose FDI produced a sustained serum ferritin rise and more 
      efficient iron repletion, with no significant pro-oxidant or inflammatory signals 
      when compared to a lower dose and other IV irons.

TI  - Ferric citrate in the management of hyperphosphataemia and iron deficiency 
      anaemia: A meta-analysis in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 414-426
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14396 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Phosphate-lowering effects of ferric citrate were reported in several 
      clinical trials, but mostly in small-scale studies. The aim of this meta-analysis 
      was to investigate the efficacy and safety of ferric citrate in controlling 
      hyperphosphataemia and iron-deficiency anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical 
      trials that enrolled CKD patients receiving ferric citrate for 
      hyperphosphataemia. Two investigators performed systematic literature search to 
      identify eligible studies, evaluated risk of bias and extracted relevant data. 
      RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Phosphate-lowering 
      effects of ferric citrate were greater compared to no active treatment 
      (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -1.15; P < 0.001) and comparable to other 
      phosphate binders (SMD = 0.03; P = 0.61). Calcium concentrations post ferric 
      citrate treatment did not differ compared to no active treatment (SMD = 0.15; P = 
      0.21) but were significantly lower compared to other phosphate binders (SMD = 
      -0.14; P = 0.01). These led to significant reductions in calcium-phosphorus 
      product with ferric citrate versus no active control (SMD = -1.02; P < 0.001) but 
      no difference versus active control (SMD = -0.01; P = 0.93). Intact parathyroid 
      hormone showed no substantial between-group difference in both comparison against 
      no active and active controls. Ferric citrate improved iron stores and anaemia 
      parameters, but increased risk of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and discoloured 
      faeces. CONCLUSION: Ferric citrate was effective in lowering phosphorus and 
      phosphorus-calcium product versus no active treatment and had comparable effects 
      versus other phosphate binders. Calcium levels were significantly lower with 
      ferric citrate than with other phosphate-lowering treatment. Ferric citrate had 
      additive effects on iron repletion and anaemia control and was associated with 
      mostly gastrointestinal side effects.

LID - 878041
AB  - Purpose. We sought to investigate the effect of IV iron repletion on platelet 
      (PLT) counts in CKD patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Methods. We 
      conducted a retrospective chart review, including all patients with CKD and IDA 
      who were treated with iron dextran total dose infusion (TDI) between 2002 and 
      2007. Patient demographics were noted, and laboratory values for creatinine, 
      hemoglobin (Hgb), iron stores and PLT were recorded pre- and post-dose. Results. 
      153 patients received a total of 251 doses of TDI (mean ± SD = 971 ± 175 mg); age 
      69 ± 12 years and Creatinine 3.3 ± 1.9 mg/dL. All CKD stages were represented 
      (stage 4 commonest). Hgb and Fe stores improved post-TDI (P ≪ 0.001). There was a 
      very mild decrease in PLT (pre-TDI 255 versus post-TDI 244, P = 0.30). The mild 
      reduction in PLT after TDI remained non-significant (P > 0.05) when data was 
      stratified by molecular weight (MW) of iron dextran used (low versus high), as 
      well as by dose administered (<1000 versus ≥1000 mg). Linear regression analysis 
      between pre-dose PLT and Tsat and Fe showed R2 of 0.01 and 0.04, respectively. 
      Conclusion. Correction of iron deficiency did not significantly lower PLT in CKD 
      patients, regardless of MW or dose used. Correlation of PLT to severity of iron 
      deficiency was very weak.

TI  - Conventional and novel impacts of ferric citrate on iron deficiency anemia and 
      phosphorus metabolism in rats.
PG  - 379-386
LID - 10.1292/jvms.19-0641 [doi]
AB  - Ferric citrate is an oral iron-based phosphate binder, being known to affect iron 
      status and improve iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. We examined whether oral administration of ferric citrate could change 
      iron status and improve anemia without affecting phosphorus metabolism in iron 
      deficiency anemia rats. In Normal rat study, normal rats were fed a diet 
      containing 0.3 or 3% ferric citrate for 11 days for setting the dose and 
      administration period of ferric citrate. The effects of ferric citrate on iron 
      status- and phosphorus metabolism-related parameters were evaluated using blood 
      and urine samples. Next, an iron deficiency anemia was induced by feeding 
      iron-depleted diet in rats. After 7 days of starting the iron-depleted diet, 0.3% 
      ferric citrate was administered for 7 days by dietary admixture. Iron status- and 
      phosphorus metabolism-related parameters were evaluated with blood and urine 
      samples. In Normal rat study, 3% ferric citrate treatment increased serum iron 
      level and transferrin saturation (TSAT), and decreased serum phosphorus level, 
      intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23) level, and urinary phosphorus 
      excretion, but 0.3% ferric citrate treatment showed no effects. On the other 
      hand, in Iron deficiency anemia rat study, 0.3% ferric citrate treatment 
      increased iron status-related parameters and improved anemia, but did not show 
      any apparent changes in phosphorus metabolism-related parameters. In conclusion, 
      ferric citrate could have hematopoietic effects without affecting phosphorus 
      metabolism, and could be a potential option for the treatment of IDA in patients 
      without CKD.

TI  - Oral Sucrosomial® iron versus intravenous iron for recovering iron deficiency 
      anaemia in ND-CKD patients: a cost- minimization analysis.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s12882-020-01716-w [doi]
LID - 57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral iron is recommended as first line treatment of anemia in 
      non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. Sucrosomial® iron, a new 
      generation oral iron with high absorption and bioavailability and a low incidence 
      of side effects, has shown to be not inferior to intravenous (IV) iron in the 
      replacement of iron deficiency anemia in patients with ND-CKD. Besides the 
      clinical benefit, it is also important to determine the comparative total costs 
      of oral versus IV iron administrations. The aim of this study was to perform a 
      cost-minimization analysis of oral Sucrosomial iron, compared with IV iron 
      gluconate from an Italian societal perspective. METHODS: Cost analysis was 
      performed on the 99 patients with ND-CKD and iron-deficiency anemia of the 
      randomized trial by Pisani et al. Human and material resources utilization was 
      recorded during each iron administration. According to study perspective, direct 
      and indirect costs were considered. Costs for each resource unit were taken from 
      official Italian sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to 
      test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed an 
      average cost/cycle per patient of € 111 for oral iron and € 1302 for IV iron. 
      Thus, the potential saving was equal to € 1191 per patient/cycle. The sensitivity 
      analysis showed that the most sensitive driver is the time loss by patient and 
      caregivers for the therapy and related-care, followed by the minutes of nursing 
      care and the number of kilometres travelled to reach the referral centre. 
      DISCUSSION: This study showed that oral Sucrosomial® iron could offer specific 
      advantages in terms of potential savings, and allowed identifying some 
      implications for future research. Such advantages still persist with the new 
      single dose IV iron formulation available in the market, although to a lesser 
      extent.

TI  - Unmet needs about iron deficiency in peritoneal dialysis: a Delphi consensus 
      panel.
PG  - 336
LID - 10.1186/s12882-022-02969-3 [doi]
LID - 336
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia and iron deficiency (ID) are common in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) patients and related to outcomes. There is growing interest about the role 
      of iron supplementation in CKD, particularly ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), also in 
      relation to the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Despite a 
      greater knowledge on ID management in patients receiving haemodialysis, a paucity 
      of data exists about peritoneal dialysis (PD). Furthermore, the aim of this paper 
      is to provide the results of a nationwide Italian survey about ID in PD using the 
      Delphi method. METHODS: A list of 16 statements (48 items) was developed about 
      four main topics: (1) approach to iron therapy in PD; (2) management experience 
      about iron therapy in PD; (3) ESA and iron in PD; (4) pharmacoeconomic impact. 
      Using the Delphi methodology, the survey was distributed online to 36 Italian 
      nephrologists with expertise in PD, who rated their level of agreement with each 
      item on a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was predefined as more than 66% of the 
      panel agreeing/disagreeing with any given statement. RESULTS: Twenty-five experts 
      (70%) answered the survey. 35 items (73%) achieved a consensus (8 negative and 27 
      positive). In particular, the diagnosis of ID is widely known, but some doubts 
      exist about how frequently test it. The use of I.V. iron seems to be routinary 
      and can save money reducing the administration of ESAs. However, internal 
      protocols are welcome. CONCLUSIONS: Expert PD nephrologists know well the problem 
      of ID and feel the necessity of shared protocols to optimize the iron therapy and 
      consequently the use of ESAs.

TI  - Bone marrow iron, iron indices, and the response to intravenous iron in patients 
      with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.
PG  - 639-47
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.10.043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information about iron stores and their relationship with transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin, and the erythropoietic response to iron 
      therapy is scarce in anemic non-dialysis-dependent patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). We examined the diagnostic utility of peripheral-iron indices and 
      the erythropoietic response to intravenous iron as indices of iron store 
      depletion using bone marrow iron as a reference test in anemic 
      non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD. STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic test study. 
      SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 100 anemic (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) patients with CKD stages 
      3-5, not receiving epoetin and iron. INDEX TESTS: TSAT index and serum ferritin 
      level at baseline and increase in hemoglobin level 1 month after 200 mg of iron 
      sucrose daily for 5 days. REFERENCE TEST: Bone marrow iron (assessed using 
      aspiration and Perls' stain), depleted versus replete, at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and 
      specificity of peripheral-iron indices and erythropoietic response to describe 
      bone marrow iron stores. RESULTS: Bone marrow iron stores were depleted in 48% of 
      patients at baseline. In iron-depleted versus -replete subjects, mean hemoglobin 
      level, median TSAT index, median serum ferritin level, and hemoglobin level 
      increase after iron sucrose administration were 8.74 +/- 1.1 (SD) versus 9.22 +/- 
      0.9 g/dL (P = 0.02), 19% (interquartile range [IQR], 15%) versus 28% (IQR, 12%; P 
      < 0.001), 100 (IQR, 131) versus 220 ng/mL (IQR, 213; P < 0.001), and 1.2 +/- 0.4 
      versus 0.8 +/- 0.3 g/dL (P < 0.001), respectively. TSAT, ferritin level, and 
      increase in hemoglobin level AUROCs were similar: 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.85), 0.76 
      (95% CI, 0.66-0.85), and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.65-0.84), respectively. LIMITATIONS: 
      Bone marrow iron as the index of iron stores. CONCLUSIONS: Half the anemic 
      patients with CKD stages 3-5 had depleted iron stores. Peripheral-iron indices 
      and erythropoietic response had equivalent, but limited, utility in identifying 
      depletion of bone marrow iron stores. Use of these indices to indicate depletion 
      of iron stores should be reconsidered.

AB  - Interest in optimizing iron management in the treatment of anemia of CKD is 
      growing due to concerns that high doses of ESAs may have deleterious effects and 
      the high cost of ESAs in comparison to iron therapy. International guidelines 
      have defined iron targets for this patient population, but there are some 
      unanswered questions with respect to long-term use of iron, such as the maximum 
      TSAT or ferritin concentration and concerns with oxidative stress. Large 
      head-to-head safety studies of the different i.v. iron preparations have not been 
      performed to date and current safety data rely on small studies and spontaneous 
      adverse event reporting. Interprofessional management of anemia, including iron 
      therapy, has shown beneficial effects and should be encouraged.

TI  - Correction of Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease With Angelica sinensis 
      Polysaccharide via Restoring EPO Production and Improving Iron Availability.
PG  - 803
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2018.00803 [doi]
LID - 803
AB  - Given the limited efficacy and potential disadvantages of 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in treating anemia of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), the development of better alternative therapies has become a 
      priority. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 
      Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) and its underlying mechanism in the 
      treatment of renal anemia. In the present study, we found that ASP could enhance 
      hypoxic induction of EPO in Hep3B cells, with a mechanism that involved the 
      stabilization of HIF-2α protein. In parallel, ASP rescued the inhibition of EPO, 
      induced by proinflammatory factor TNF-α through blocking GATA2 and NF-κB 
      activation. In a rat model of adenine-induced anemia of CKD, oral administration 
      of ASP corrected anemia and alleviated renal damage and inflammation. By 
      increasing the accumulation of HIF-2α protein and reducing the expression of 
      NF-κB and GATA2 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, ASP stimulated both renal 
      and hepatic EPO production, and resulted in an elevation of serum EPO. The 
      restoration of EPO production and EPOR mRNA expression with ASP treatment 
      activated EPOR downstream JAK2/STAT5 and PI3K/Akt signaling, induced their target 
      genes, such as Bcl-xL, Fam132b and Tfrc, and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in bone 
      marrow-derived mononuclear cells of CKD rats. Furthermore, we found that ASP 
      suppressed hepatic hepcidin expression, mobilized iron from spleen and liver and 
      increased serum iron. These findings demonstrate that ASP elicits anti-anemic 
      action by restoring EPO production and improving iron availability in the setting 
      of CKD in rats.

TI  - Anemia and iron deficiency among chronic kidney disease Stages 3-5ND patients in 
      the Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study: often 
      unmeasured, variably treated.
PG  - 613-624
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfz091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: International variation in anemia assessment and management practices 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is poorly understood. METHODS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional analysis of anemia laboratory monitoring, prevalence and 
      management in the prospective Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice 
      Patterns Study (CKDopps). A total of 6766 participants with CKD Stages 3a-5ND 
      from nephrology clinics in Brazil, France, Germany and the USA were included. 
      RESULTS: Among patients with anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL), 36-58% in Brazil, the 
      USA and Germany had repeat hemoglobin measured and 40-61% had iron indices 
      measured within 3 months of the index hemoglobin measurement. Anemia was more 
      common in the USA and Brazil than in France and Germany across CKD stages. Higher 
      ferritin and lower iron saturation (TSAT) levels were observed with lower 
      hemoglobin levels, and higher ferritin with more advanced CKD. The proportion of 
      anemic patients with ferritin <100 ng/mL or TSAT <20% ranged from 42% in Brazil 
      to 53% in France and Germany, and of these patients, over 40% in Brazil, Germany 
      and the USA, compared with 27% in France, were treated with oral or intravenous 
      iron within 3 months after hemoglobin measurement. The proportion of patients 
      with hemoglobin <10 g/dL treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ranged 
      from 28% in the USA to 57% in Germany. CONCLUSIONS: Hemoglobin and iron stores 
      are measured less frequently than per guidelines. Among all regions, there was a 
      substantial proportion of anemic patients with iron deficiency who were not 
      treated with iron, highlighting an area for practice improvement in CKD care.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of PT20, an iron-based phosphate binder, for the treatment of 
      hyperphosphataemia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, 
      Phase IIb study in patients with haemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1399-1407
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfaa116 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphataemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). PT20 (ferric iron oxide adipate) is an investigational molecule engineered 
      to offer enhanced phosphate-binding properties relative to other phosphate 
      binders. METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 
      dose-ranging study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02151643), the efficacy and 
      safety of 28 days of oral PT20 treatment were evaluated in patients with 
      dialysis-dependent CKD. Participants were randomly assigned in an 8:8:8:13:13 
      ratio to receive PT20 (400, 800, 1600 or 3200 mg) or placebo three times daily. 
      RESULTS: Among 153 participants, 129 completed treatment [7 discontinued because 
      of adverse events (AEs), 2 because of hyperphosphataemia and 15 for other 
      reasons]. PT20 treatment for 28 days resulted in a statistically significant and 
      dose-dependent reduction in serum phosphate concentration. There were no 
      statistically significant effects of PT20 treatment on changes in haemoglobin or 
      ferritin concentrations or transferrin saturation between Days 1 and 29. The 
      incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was broadly similar across the PT20 and 
      placebo groups (42-59% versus 44%). The most common PT20 treatment-related AEs 
      were gastrointestinal, primarily diarrhoea (13-18%) and discoloured faeces 
      (3-23%). No serious AEs were considered to be related to study treatment. There 
      were no clinically significant changes in laboratory results reflecting acid/base 
      status or increases in ferritin that could indicate the absorption of components 
      of PT20. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study investigating the efficacy and safety 
      of PT20 in patients with hyperphosphataemia and dialysis-dependent CKD, PT20 
      significantly lowered serum phosphate concentrations and was generally well 
      tolerated.

TI  - Serum iron markers are inadequate for guiding iron repletion in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 77-83
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04190510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Iron (Fe) overload may complicate parenteral Fe 
      therapy used to enhance the efficacy of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in the 
      treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease. However, serum Fe markers are 
      influenced by inflammation or malignancy and may not accurately reflect the 
      amount of body Fe. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We studied the 
      relationship between parenteral Fe therapy, conventional serum Fe markers, and 
      liver iron concentration (LIC) measured using magnetic resonance R2 relaxometry 
      (FerriScan) in 25 Fe-deficient predialysis chronic kidney disease patients before 
      and 2 and 12 weeks after single high-dose intravenous Fe and in 15 chronic 
      hemodialysis patients with elevated serum ferritin (>500 μg/L). RESULTS: In 
      predialysis patients, there was strong dose dependency between the administered 
      Fe dose and changes in LIC at weeks 2 and 12; however, no dose dependency between 
      Fe dose and changes in ferritin or transferrin saturation (TSAT) were observed. 
      In hemodialysis patients, LIC correlated with the cumulative Fe dose and duration 
      of dialysis but not with current ferritin or TSAT. The cumulative Fe dose 
      remained a significant independent predictor of LIC in a multiple regression 
      model. Two dialysis patients who received >6 g parenteral Fe had substantially 
      elevated LIC >130 μmol/g, which is associated with hemochromatosis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In Fe-deficient predialysis patients, intravenous Fe therapy is associated with 
      increases in LIC unrelated to changes in conventional Fe markers. In hemodialysis 
      patients, TSAT and ferritin are poor indicators of body Fe load, and some 
      patients have LICs similar to those found in hemochromatosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The guidelines for anaemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients have changed substantially during the past 10 years. We here evaluate 
      whether these changes are followed by subsequent modifications in physicians' 
      anaemia management in Sweden. METHODS: We included patients incident to the 
      Swedish Renal Registry for CKD non-dialysis (CKD-ND, referred patients with an 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and haemodialysis (HD) 
      between 2008 and 2013. Time trends in anaemia management were investigated in 
      relation to prescribed medication, laboratory measures and other relevant 
      clinical characteristics. Linear and binominal regression models were used to 
      describe trends across three predefined time periods (2008-09, 2010-11 and 
      2012-13). RESULTS: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) use decreased over 
      time among both CKD-ND and HD patients [risk ratio (RR) 2012-13 compared with 
      2008-09 for CKD-ND 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96; RR for HD 0.95, 
      95% CI 0.93-0.97]. Mean ESA dose decreased significantly among HD patients (7% in 
      2010-11 compared with 2008-09 and another 3% during 2012-13). Over the time 
      periods studied, ESA doses increased slightly in the CKD-ND population. Mean 
      haemoglobin (Hb) levels decreased in CKD-ND patients, among both ESA users and 
      non-users, whereas it decreased to a lesser degree, albeit significantly, among 
      HD ESA users. The risk of having an Hb >120 g/L decreased, especially between 
      2008-09 and 2010-11. Iron use increased over time, mainly in the HD population, 
      but also among CKD-ND ESA non-users. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in guidelines have 
      influenced the clinical anaemia practice of Swedish nephrology care, resulting in 
      lower ESA use and lower Hb levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since in chronic kidney disease (CKD) iron deficiency anemia (IDA) 
      can coexist with inflammation-induced immobilization of iron in macrophages 
      (anemia of chronic disorders - ACD), we assessed the utility of ferritin, 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT), and hepcidin for differentiation of mixed IDA-ACD 
      from ACD, using bone marrow (BM) examination as reference. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional, single-center study analyzed 162 non-dialysis iron and 
      epoietin-naïve CKD patients (52% males, median age 67 years, eGFR 14.2 mL/min 
      1.73 m(2), hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL). BM aspiration, serum hepcidin (ELISA), ferritin, 
      TSAT, and C-Reactive protein (CRP) were the main studied parameters. RESULTS: ACD 
      was seen in 51%, IDA-ACD in 40%, while "pure" IDA in only 9%. In univariate and 
      binomial analyses, IDA-ACD differed from ACD by lower ferritin and TSAT, but not 
      by hepcidin or CRP. Correspondingly, in receiver operating curve analysis, 
      ferritin and TSAT differentiated IDA-ACD from ACD, at cutoffs of 165 ng/mL and 
      14%, but with moderate precision (sensitivity and specificity of 72%, and 61%, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: The mixed pattern IDA-ACD could be more prevalent than 
      estimated in non-dialysis CKD. Ferritin and, to a lesser degree, TSAT are useful 
      in the diagnosis of IDA superimposed on ACD, while hepcidin, although reflecting 
      BM macrophages iron, seems to have limited utility.

TI  - Whole-body iron transport and metabolism: Mechanistic, multi-scale model to 
      improve treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, 
      oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is 
      characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of 
      erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant 
      iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum 
      hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are 
      not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are 
      unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse 
      effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport 
      related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive 
      iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron 
      dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For 
      prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of 
      whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools 
      of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron 
      in vivo, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. 
      Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow 
      simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and 
      clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and 
      the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron 
      dextran. This in silico whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year 
      of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) 
      levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux 
      from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified 
      unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and 
      iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for 
      future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical 
      experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective 
      personalized treatment of CKD anemia.

      patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1071342

LID - 1071342
AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined the effects of roxadustat on the values of anemia, iron 
      metabolism, renal function, proteinuria, and lipid metabolism and identified the 
      associated factors of the change in hemoglobin levels after roxadustat 
      administration in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who were 
      receiving an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA). METHODS: We conducted 
      retrospective analysis of the changes in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, total 
      cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels; transferrin saturation; 
      the estimated glomerular filtration rate; and the urinary protein/creatinine 
      ratio over 24 weeks after the change from an ESA to roxadustat in 50 patients 
      with non-dialysis CKD and anemia (roxadustat group). Seventy-two patients with 
      non-dialysis CKD and anemia who proceeded ESA therapy were used as the control 
      (ESA) group. RESULTS: We observed no significant between-group differences in 
      clinical parameters at baseline except for the significantly lower hemoglobin 
      concentration and lower proportion of diabetes mellitus in the roxadustat group. 
      The hemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in the roxadustat group 
      after 24 weeks (11.3 ± 1.2 versus 10.3 ± 1.0 g/dL; value of p < 0.05), whereas 
      the transferrin saturation, ferritin concentration, estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate, and urinary protein/creatinine ratio were not different between 
      the two groups. TC (135.9 ± 40.0 versus 165.3 ± 38.4 mg/dL; value of p < 0.05), 
      LDL-C (69.1 ± 28.3 versus 87.2 ± 31.5 mg/dL; value of p < 0.05), HDL-C 
      (41.4 ± 13.5 versus 47.2 ± 15.3 mg/dL; value of p < 0.05), and triglyceride 
      concentrations (101.5 ± 52.7 versus 141.6 ± 91.4 mg/dL, value of p < 0.05) were 
      significantly lower in the roxadustat group compared with the ESA group at 24 
      weeks. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the roxadustat dose at 
      baseline (standard coefficient [β] = 0.280, value of p = 0.043) was correlated 
      with the change in the hemoglobin levels during the first 4 weeks of roxadustat 
      treatment, whereas age (β = 0.319, value of p = 0.017) and the roxadustat dose at 
      24 weeks (β = -0.347, value of p = 0.010) were correlated with the hemoglobin 
      concentration after 24 weeks of roxadustat administration. CONCLUSION: Roxadustat 
      can improve anemia and reduce serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in 
      non-dialysis CKD patients after the patients' treatment was switched from an ESA 
      without affecting renal function or proteinuria. These results indicate that 
      roxadustat has superior effects to ESAs regarding anemia and lipid metabolism at 
      the dose selected for the comparison in patients with non-dialysis CKD.

      was a prospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage IIIB or IV 
      undergoing intravenous iron (group A) and/or ESA (group B). Full blood profiles 
      were determined over the study period. Glycemic control was monitored using A1C, 
      seven-point daily glucose three times weekly, and continuous glucose monitoring 
      (CGM). RESULTS: There were 15 patients in both group A and group B. Mean A1C (95% 
      CI) values fell in both groups (7.40% [6.60-8.19] to 6.96% [6.27-7.25], P<0.01, 
      with intravenous iron and 7.31% [6.42-8.54] to 6.63% [6.03-7.36], P=0.013, ESA). 
      There was no change in mean blood glucose in group A (9.55 mmol/l [8.20-10.90] 
      vs. 9.71 mmol/l [8.29-11.13], P=0.07) and in group B (8.72 mmol/l [7.31-10.12] 
      vs. 8.78 mmol/l [7.47-9.99], P=0.61) over the study period. Hemoglobin and 
      hematocrit values significantly increased following both treatments. There was no 
      linear relationship found between the change in A1C values and the rise of 
      hemoglobin following either treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both iron and ESA cause a 
      significant fall in A1C values without a change to glycemic control in patients 
      with diabetes and CKD. At the present time, regular capillary glucose 
      measurements and the concurrent use of CGM remain the best alternative 
      measurements of glycemic control in this patient group.

TI  - The Impact of Iron Supplementation for Treating Anemia in Patients with Chronic 
      Kidney Disease: Results from Pairwise and Network Meta-Analyses of Randomized 
      Controlled Trials.
LID - 10.3390/ph13050085 [doi]
LID - 85
AB  - After relative erythropoietin deficiency, iron deficiency is the second most 
      important contributing factor for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. Iron supplementation is a crucial part of the treatment of anemia in 
      CKD patients, and intravenous (IV) iron supplementation is considered to be 
      superior to per os (PO) iron supplementation. The differences between the 
      available formulations are poorly characterized. This report presents results 
      from pairwise and network meta-analyses carried out after a comprehensive search 
      in sources of published and unpublished studies, according to the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations 
      (International prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO reference ID: 
      CRD42020148155). Meta-analytic calculations were performed for the outcome of 
      non-response to iron supplementation (i.e., hemoglobin (Hgb) increase of <0.5-1.0 
      g/dL, or initiation/intensification of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) 
      therapy, or increase/change of iron supplement, or requirements of blood 
      transfusion). A total of 34 randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified, 
      providing numerical data for analyses covering 93.7% (n = 10.097) of the total 
      study population. At the network level, iron supplementation seems to have a more 
      protective effect against the outcome of non-response before the start of 
      dialysis than once dialysis is initiated, and some preparations seem to be more 
      potent (e.g., ferumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose), compared to the rest of iron 
      supplements assessed (surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) > 0.8). 
      This study provides parameters for adequately following-up patients requiring 
      iron supplementation, by presenting the most performing preparations, and, 
      indirectly, by making it possible to identify good responders among all patients 
      treated with these medicines.

TI  - Zinc levels after iron supplementation in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 164-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of iron 
      supplementation on zinc distribution in nondialyzed chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized observational study. SETTING: 
      Outpatients of the Nephrology Division at Federal University of São Paulo. 
      PATIENTS: Zinc and iron status of 38 nondialyzed patients (63% male; creatinine 
      clearance, 34.5+/-13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2) was evaluated before and after 3 
      intramuscular injections of 100 mg iron each. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 
      following parameters were analyzed: erythrocytes and plasma zinc, zinc 
      protoporphyrin (ZPP), plasma ferritin, transferrin saturation (TFS), and total 
      iron. The patients' diets were analyzed by the Association of Official Analytical 
      Chemists method for macronutrients, and neutron activation analysis was used for 
      iron and zinc concentration determinations. RESULTS: Ferritin and TFS increased 
      from 86.3+/-67.5 ng/mL to 105.4+/-63.7 ng/mL and from 19.5+/-7.4% to 23.2+/-6.7% 
      (P <.05), respectively, after iron supplementation. Absolute iron deficiency 
      (ferritin <100 microg/L and TFS <20%) was present in 41% of the patients and 
      decreased to 15.7% after iron treatment. In comparison with baseline values 
      (76.4+/-16.7 microg/dL), there were no significant changes in plasma zinc levels, 
      but after supplementation the number of patients with low plasma zinc levels 
      decreased from 46.1% to 23.7% (P =.08). At baseline, erythrocyte zinc was 
      49.0+/-7.6 microg Zn/gHb, and 76.3% of the patients had high erythrocyte zinc 
      concentration. After iron treatment, erythrocyte zinc decreased to 45.5+/-7.3 
      microg Zn/gHb (P =.001). No significant change was observed in ZPP concentration. 
      The analysis of the diet showed energy and protein intakes of 26.2+/-7.1 
      kcal/kg/day and 0.89+/-0.2 g/kg/day, respectively, and a low intake of both iron 
      and zinc. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that iron deficiency may contribute to 
      the inadequate distribution of zinc in patients with CKD and that iron 
      supplementation may decrease the abnormal elevated erythrocyte zinc levels of 
      these patients.

PG  - 69-74
LID - 10.1159/000334877 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Renal NSF advocates correction of anaemia in chronic kidney 
      disease patients. Oral iron is often insufficient, while intravenous 
      supplementation replenishes and maintains iron stores. There is a need to 
      administer high doses of iron in a single rapid infusion to enable efficient 
      costs, effective utilisation of time for patients and staff and optimal use of 
      resources. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of consecutive patients 
      referred for iron dextran (Cosmofer) therapy. This was administered over 2 h 40 
      min compared with the normal regime of 4-6 h. Blood pressure was recorded 
      throughout administration. Adverse drug reactions were recorded over 2 weeks. 
      Serum ferritin, haemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate were 
      measured at baseline and 3 months. RESULTS: One hundred patients (59 male, mean 
      age 69 years), received a median dose of 1,000 mg Cosmofer in a median time of 2 
      h 40 min. Mean serum ferritin rose from 178 at baseline to 413 μg/l (p < 0.001). 
      Mean haemoglobin rose by 1.5 g/dl (p < 0.001). There was no decline in estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate after 3 months. No adverse reactions were noted. 
      CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that accelerated administration of iron dextran is 
      safe and effective with no short-term effects on renal function. This resulted in 
      a time saving of approximately 67 hours.

TI  - A multicentre prospective double blinded randomised controlled trial of 
      intravenous iron (ferric Derisomaltose (FDI)) in Iron deficient but not anaemic 
      patients with chronic kidney disease on functional status.
PG  - 115

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Intravenous (IV) iron in heart failure leads to improvement in 
      exercise capacity and improvement in quality-of-life measurements; however, data 
      in patients with CKD are lacking. METHODS: The Iron and the Heart Study was a 
      prospective double blinded randomised study in non-anaemic CKD stages 3b-5 
      patients with ID which investigated whether 1000 mg of IV iron (ferric 
      derisomaltose (FDI)) could improve exercise capacity in comparison to placebo 
      measured at 1 and 3 months post infusion. Secondary objectives included effects 
      on haematinic profiles and haemoglobin, safety analysis and quality of life 
      questionnaires (QoL). RESULTS: We randomly assigned 54 patients mean (SD) age for 
      FDI (n = 26) 61.6 (10.1) years vs placebo (n = 28; 57.8 (12.9) years) and mean 
      eGFR (33.2 (9.3) vs. 29.1 (9.6) ml/min/1.73m(2)) at baseline, respectively. 
      Adjusting for baseline measurements, six-minute walk test (6MWT) showed no 
      statistically significant difference between arms at 1 month (p = 0.736), or 
      3 months (p = 0.741). There were non-significant increases in 6MWT from baseline 
      to 1 and 3 months in the FDI arm. Haemoglobin (Hb) at 1 and 3 months remained 
      stable. There were statistically significant increases in ferritin (SF) and 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) at 1 and 3 months (p < 0.001). There was a modest 
      numerical improvement in QoL parameters. There were no adverse events 
      attributable to IV iron. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a short-term 
      beneficial effect of FDI on exercise capacity, but it was not significant despite 
      improvements in parameters of iron status, maintenance of Hb concentration, and 
      numerical increases in functional capacity and quality of life scores. A larger 
      study will be required to confirm if intravenous iron is beneficial in iron 
      deficient non-anaemic non-dialysis CKD patients without heart failure to improve

PG  - 281
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High iron load might have a number of toxic effects in the organism. 
      Recently intravenous (iv) iron has been proposed to induce elevation of 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia in iron 
      deficient subjects. High levels of FGF23 are associated with increased mortality 
      in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. CKD patients are often treated 
      with iv iron therapy in order to maintain iron stores and erythropoietin 
      responsiveness, also in the case of not being iron depleted. Therefore, the 
      effect of a single high iv dose of two different iron preparations, iron 
      isomaltoside 1000 (IIM) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), on plasma levels of 
      FGF23 and phosphate was examined in normal and uremic iron repleted rats. 
      METHODS: Iron was administered iv as a single high dose of 80 mg/kg bodyweight 
      and the effects on plasma levels of iFGF23, phosphate, Ca2+, PTH, transferrin, 
      ferritin and iron were examined in short and long term experiments (n = 99). 
      Blood samples were obtained at time 0, 30, 60, 180 minutes, 24 and 48 hours and 
      in a separate study after 1 week. Uremia was induced by 5/6-nephrectomy. RESULTS: 
      Nephrectomized rats had significant uremia, hyperparathyroidism and elevated 
      FGF23. Iron administration resulted in significant increases in plasma ferritin 
      levels. No significant differences were seen in plasma levels of iFGF23, 
      phosphate and PTH between the experimental groups at any time point within 48 
      hours or at 1 week after infusion of the iron compounds compared to vehicle. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In non-iron depleted normal and uremic rats a single high dose of 
      either of two intravenous iron preparations, iron isomaltoside 1000, and ferric 
      carboxymaltose, had no effect on plasma levels of iFGF23 and phosphate for up to 
      seven days.

TI  - Iron Sucrose: A Double-Edged Sword in High Phosphate Media-Induced Vascular 
      Calcification.
PG  - 798-807
LID - 10.1007/s00223-020-00804-1 [doi]
AB  - The high incidence of vascular calcification (VC) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) has become an important clinical subject. Hyperphosphatemia is a 
      primary cause of CKD-related VC. Intravenous iron sucrose (IS) is commonly used 
      to treat anemia in CKD patients, and is effective and well tolerated worldwide. 
      However, the interaction between iron and VC remains controversial, and the 
      underlying mechanisms are yet to be clarified. In the present study, ex vivo 
      normal rat aortic rings were cultured with various concentrations of phosphate 
      and IS, and the levels of calcium and iron depositions, oxidative injury, as well 
      as phenotypic marker genes were detected. To the best of our knowledge, the 
      present study is the first to report that IS is a double-edged sword in high 
      phosphate media-induced VC which not only alleviates VC in a dose-dependent 
      manner but also leads to iron overload in vasculature when in high concentration. 
      IS is a promising agent for VC prevention in patients with hyperphosphatemia and 
      iron deficiency. Meanwhile, the appropriate blood concentration of IS in patients 
      with hyperphosphatemia needs to be explored clinically.

AB  - Anemia and iron deficiency are highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      and in chronic heart failure. Both may epidemiologically predict future renal 
      and/or cardiovascular events. However, anemia treatment with either 
      erythropoietin or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents failed to induce a prognostic 
      benefit in either CKD or chronic heart failure. Instead, in the subgroup of 
      chronic dialysis patients, liberal intravenous iron supplementation was 
      beneficial, and ongoing clinical trials are testing the prognostic implication of 
      intravenous iron supplementation in chronic heart failure. Finally, HIF 
      stabilizers are a new treatment option for anemia in chronic kidney disease, and 
      safety studies are currently ongoing in CKD patients. Whether patients suffering 
      from chronic heart failure might also benefit from this treatment is currently 
      unknown.

      Rats with Chronic Kidney Disease: Accumulation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-2α via

AB  - Jian-Pi-Yi-Shen (JPYS), the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) decoction, has 
      been commonly used to treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications 
      such as anemia. JPYS has been previously found to induce erythropoietin (EPO) 
      production in HEK293T cells and CKD rats. However, the mechanism of JPYS in 
      treating anemia of CKD rats has remained largely unknown. Here, we further extend 
      our effort to investigate the translational control of hypoxia inducible factor- 
      (HIF-) α protein via ERK signaling and the effect on iron recycling-related 
      protein expression by JPYS, thus revealing the mechanism of JPYS in correcting 
      anemia in CKD. Experimental CKD rats with anemia were induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. 
      Rats were administrated orally with high dose (6.0 g/kg/d) and low dose 
      (1.5 g/kg/d) of JPYS for 90 days. Serum hepcidin level was determined to evaluate 
      iron homeostasis. The protein expressions of HIF-2α, erythropoietin (EPO), 
      ferritin, and ferroportin (FPN) and the phosphorylation level of extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were detected by Western blot. The results 
      showed that JPYS treatment significantly ameliorated kidney function by reducing 
      increased levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), and urine 
      protein (UPRO). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Masson staining observation showed 
      that the renal pathological damage was restored in JPYS-treated CKD rats. In 
      parallel, JPYS markedly improved CKD anemia through upregulation of red blood 
      cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), and hematocrit (HCT). JPYS stimulated EPO and 
      HIF-2α protein expressions in both the kidney and liver of CKD rats. Furthermore, 
      JPYS induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 protein. In addition, JPYS regulated 
      protein expression of ferritin and FPN in both the liver and spleen of CKD rats 
      and the serum level of hepcidin. In conclusion, JPYS induces the expression of 
      EPO through ERK-mediated HIF-2α protein accumulation and regulates systemic iron 
      recycling, supporting its role in promoting erythropoiesis and improvement of 
      anemia in CKD.

AB  - Iron parameters have not been well characterized in pre-dialysis patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it remains unclear if abnormal iron balance is 
      associated with increased mortality. Therefore, we performed a historical cohort 
      study using data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse to evaluate 
      the relationship between iron status and mortality. We identified a pre-dialysis 
      CKD cohort with at least one set of iron indices between 2006-2015. The cohort 
      was divided into four iron groups based on the joint quartiles of serum 
      transferrin saturation (percent) and ferritin concentration (ng/ml): reference 
      (16-28%, 55-205 ng/ml), low iron (0.4-16%, 0.4-55 ng/ml), high iron (28-99.6%, 
      205-4941 ng/ml), and function iron deficiency (0.8-16%, 109-2783 ng/ml). We 
      compared mortality risk between the iron groups using matching weights based on 
      multinomial propensity score models and Poisson rate-based regression. We also 
      evaluated if the association between iron groups and mortality differs between 
      the diabetic and non-diabetic subgroups. Of the 80,067 eligible veterans, 32,489 
      were successfully matched. During the mean follow-up period of 4.0 years, 
      adjusted relative rate (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality in three 
      abnormal iron groups were increased compared to the reference: functional iron 
      deficiency [1.21 (1.17, 1.25)], low iron [1.10 (1.07, 1.14)], and high iron [1.09 
      (1.06, 1.13)]. The mortality risk was similar between diabetic and non-diabetic 
      subgroups for each iron group. Thus, an abnormal iron balance, particularly 
      functional iron deficiency, is associated with increased mortality in CKD.

TI  - Protocol and Baseline Data of a Multicentre Prospective Double-Blinded Randomized 
      Study of Intravenous Iron on Functional Status in Patients with Chronic Kidney 
      Disease.
PG  - 493-500
LID - 10.1159/000507872 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) due to an inadequate dietary intake of iron, poor absorption from 
      the gut and increased iron losses. In addition to preventing anaemia, iron is 
      important for normal heart function, being involved in processes that generate a 
      necessary continuous energy supply. Treatment with intravenous (IV) iron has been 
      suggested to lead to improvement in heart function and well-being in people with 
      ID and CKD. In the Iron and the Heart Study, we hypothesized that IV iron 
      treatment will primarily improve exercise capacity and may secondarily impact the 
      feeling of well-being in comparison to placebo over 3 months in non-anaemic CKD 
      patients who have ID. METHODS: This was a prospective double-blinded explorative 
      randomized, multi-centre study designed to compare the effects of IV iron 
      supplementation and placebo in iron-deficient but not anaemic patients with 
      established CKD stages 3b-5 on functional status, and in addition cardiac 
      structure and function. The study included 54 adults with serum ferritin (SF) 
      <100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation <20%, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1,000 
      mg IV ferric derisomaltose or placebo. Following randomization, participants 
      underwent baseline assessments and then received IV iron or placebo infusion. 
      Each participant was followed up at months 1 and 3. At each visit, patients 
      underwent clinical review, measurements of hematinics and haemoglobin (Hb), and 
      assessments of physical function and well-being. The primary outcome was exercise 
      capacity using the 6-minute walk test. Secondary objectives included effects on 
      hematinic profiles and Hb concentration, changes in myocardial parameters 
      assessed with speckle tracking echocardiography and change in patients' quality 
      of life. RESULTS: Between October 2016 and April 2018, 55 from 326 individuals 
      from 3 UK centres attended screening and were randomized. The mean (SD) age was 
      59.6 (11.7) years, 26 (48%) patients were male, the majority were Caucasians (42; 
      78%), and 32 (59%) were non-smokers. The mean (SD) body mass index was 30.3 
      (6.5); SF was 66.3 (44.1) µg/L, TS was 20.1 (7.4) % and Hb was 128.7 (10.1) g/L 
      at randomization for the whole group. Mean (SD) serum creatinine was 186.7 (58.6) 
      µmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate was 31.1 (9.6) mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
      urinary albumin and protein/creatinine ratios 60.9 (133.3) and 83.8 (128.4) 
      mg/mmol respectively. The mean (SD) C-reactive protein was 5.0 (4.4) mg/L and the 
      mean (SD) 6-minute walk distance at baseline was 401.2 (120.2) m. CONCLUSION: The 
      Iron and the Heart Trial will provide important information on the short-term 
      effects of IV iron treatment in CKD patients with ID without anaemia on measures 
      of exercise capacity, quality of life and mechanistic data on myocardial 
      structure and function. TRIAL REGISTRATION: European Clinical Trials Database

TI  - Serum total iron-binding capacity and iron status in patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease: A cross-sectional study in 
      Vietnam.
PG  - 48-54
LID - 10.6133/apjcn.202003_29(1).0007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We performed this study to evaluate serum iron and 
      ferritin concentrations, serum total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and proportion 
      of overall iron deficiency among patients with non-dialysisdependent chronic 
      kidney disease (ND-CKD). METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A hospital-based 
      cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 175 adult patients with 
      stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) by using 51 healthy age-sex-matched 
      Vietnamese adults as the control group. We next examined the prevalence of anemia 
      and determined the serum iron and ferritin concentrations and TIBC. Anemia in CKD 
      was defined as hemoglobin levels <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. 
      Transferrin saturation (TSAT, %) was calculated as (serum iron x 100)/TIBC. 
      Functional iron deficiency was defined as serum ferritin >100 ng/mL and TSAT 
      <20%, and absolute iron deficiency was defined as serum ferritin <100 ng/mL and 
      TSAT <20%. Overall iron deficiency was defined as the presence of either absolute 
      or functional iron deficiency. RESULTS: Anemia prevalence in our study was 
      approximately 88.6% with a mean hemoglobin concentration of 9.71±2.26 g/dL. The 
      median serum TIBC was lower in the CKD group (50.4 μmol/L) than in the control 
      group (66.0 μmol/L; p<0.001). The proportion of overall iron deficiency was 
      44.0%. TIBC had a diagnostic value for overall iron deficiency (area under the 
      ROC curve=0.81; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia and iron deficiency are common in 
      Vietnamese patients with NDCKD. TIBC had diagnostic value for overall iron 
      deficiency.

TI  - Protocol and baseline data for a prospective open-label explorative randomized 
      single-center comparative study to determine the effects of various intravenous 
      iron preparations on markers of oxidative stress and kidney injury in chronic 
      kidney disease (IRON-CKD).
PG  - 194
LID - 10.1186/s13063-019-3291-x [doi]
LID - 194
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) iron is frequently used to treat iron 
      deficiency/anemia in patients who are unable to tolerate oral iron or the oral 
      iron is not sufficient toreplete iron requirements. However, safety concerns 
      regarding the potential increase in oxidative stress and other adverse effects 
      persist and it remains unclear whether all iron preparations are equivalent. 
      Indeed, the comparative risk of adverse events with IV iron preparations has not 
      been extensively assessed. We hypothesize that IV iron leads to changes in 
      oxidative stress, endothelial function, and potential renal damage depending on 
      the iron formulation (related to the generation of "free" or catalytic labile 
      iron) and this may result in more tubular and glomerular injury manifested as 
      increased proteinuria and raised neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 
      (NGAL) levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: IRON-CKD is 
      a prospective, open-label, explorative, randomized, single-center study designed 
      to compare the safety and efficacy of three parenteral iron preparations: 
      low-molecular-weight iron dextran-Cosmofer, iron sucrose-Venofer, and iron 
      isomaltoside-Monofer. The study includes 40 adults who have established CKD 
      stages 3-5 and serum ferritin (SF) of less than 200 μg/L or transferrin 
      saturation (TS) of less than 20% (or both); they were randomly assigned in a 
      1:1:1:1 ratio to 200 mg iron dextran, 200 mg iron sucrose, 200 mg iron 
      isomaltoside, or 1000 mg iron isomaltoside. After randomization, participants 
      undergo baseline assessments and then an iron infusion. Each participant is 
      followed up at 2 h, day 1, week 1, and months 1 and 3. At each follow-up visit, 
      patients undergo clinical review, measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), blood 
      tests for renal function, and collection of serum/plasma samples for oxidative 
      stress and inflammatory markers. The primary outcomes are measures of oxidative 
      stress, inflammatory markers, and markers of acute renal injury in comparison 
      with baseline measures of each iron preparation and between each of the iron 
      preparations. Secondary objectives include effects on hematinic profiles and 
      hemoglobin concentrations, changes in arterial stiffness, incidence of 
      significant side effects, and change in patients' quality of life. RESULTS: 
      Between October 2015 and April 2018, 521 individuals were identified as potential 
      participants; 216 were contacted, 56 expressed an interest, 49 attended a 
      screening visit, and 40 were confirmed to meet the eligibility criteria and were 
      randomly assigned. The mean age was 58.8 (standard error of the mean 2.2) years, 
      and 23 (58%) were male. All patients were white and English-speaking. The mean SF 
      was 68.8 μg/L, TS was 21.4%, and haemoglobin was 122.6 g/L at randomization for 
      the whole group. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 28.2 
      mL/min/1.73 m2 the urinary protein/ creatinine ratio was 154.2 mg/mmol, and CRP 
      was 7.5 mg/L. DISCUSSION: IRON-CKD will provide important information on the 
      short-term effects of three preparations of IV iron in CKD patients with 
      biochemical functional or absolute iron deficiency on measures of oxidative 
      stress, inflammation, endothelial function, and renal injury. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - A single approach to targeting transferrin receptor 2 corrects iron and 
      erythropoietic defects in murine models of anemia of inflammation and chronic 
      kidney disease.

AB  - Anemia is a common complication of systemic inflammation. Proinflammatory 
      cytokines both decrease erythroblast sensitivity to erythropoietin (EPO) and 
      increase the levels of the hepatic hormone hepcidin, sequestering iron in stores 
      and causing functional iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
      a peculiar form of anemia of inflammation, characterized by impaired EPO 
      production paralleling progressive kidney damage. Traditional therapy based on 
      increased EPO (often in combination with iron) may have off-target effects due to 
      EPO interaction with its non-erythroid receptors. Transferrin Receptor 2 (Tfr2) 
      is a mediator of the iron-erythropoiesis crosstalk. Its deletion in the liver 
      hampers hepcidin production, increasing iron absorption, whereas its deletion in 
      the hematopoietic compartment increases erythroid EPO sensitivity and red blood 
      cell production. Here, we show that selective hematopoietic Tfr2 deletion 
      ameliorates anemia in mice with sterile inflammation in the presence of normal 
      kidney function, promoting EPO responsiveness and erythropoiesis without 
      increasing serum EPO levels. In mice with CKD, characterized by absolute rather 
      than functional iron deficiency, Tfr2 hematopoietic deletion had a similar effect 
      on erythropoiesis but anemia improvement was transient because of limited iron 
      availability. Also, increasing iron levels by downregulating only hepatic Tfr2 
      had a minor effect on anemia. However, simultaneous deletion of hematopoietic and 
      hepatic Tfr2, stimulating erythropoiesis and increased iron supply, was 
      sufficient to ameliorate anemia for the entire protocol. Thus, our results 
      suggest that combined targeting of hematopoietic and hepatic Tfr2 may be a 
      therapeutic option to balance erythropoiesis stimulation and iron increase, 
      without affecting EPO levels.

TI  - Effects of ferric citrate and intravenous iron sucrose on markers of mineral, 
      bone, and iron homeostasis in a rat model of CKD-MBD.
PG  - 1857-1867
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfac162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia and chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) 
      are common and begin early in CKD. Limited studies have concurrently compared the 
      effects of ferric citrate (FC) versus intravenous (IV) iron on CKD-MBD and iron 
      homeostasis in moderate CKD. METHODS: We tested the effects of 10 weeks of 2% FC 
      versus IV iron sucrose in rats with moderate CKD (Cy/+ male rat) and untreated 
      normal (NL) littermates. Outcomes included a comprehensive assessment of CKD-MBD, 
      iron homeostasis and oxidative stress. RESULTS: CKD rats had azotemia, elevated 
      phosphorus, parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). Compared 
      with untreated CKD rats, treatment with FC led to lower plasma phosphorus, intact 
      FGF23 and a trend (P = 0.07) toward lower C-terminal FGF23. FC and IV iron 
      equally reduced aorta and heart calcifications to levels similar to NL animals. 
      Compared with NL animals, CKD animals had higher bone turnover, lower trabecular 
      volume and no difference in mineralization; these were unaffected by either iron 
      treatment. Rats treated with IV iron had cortical and bone mechanical properties 
      similar to NL animals. FC increased the transferrin saturation rate compared with 
      untreated CKD and NL rats. Neither iron treatment increased oxidative stress 
      above that of untreated CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Oral FC improved phosphorus 
      homeostasis, some iron-related parameters and the production and cleavage of 
      FGF23. The intermittent effect of low-dose IV iron sucrose on cardiovascular 
      calcification and bone should be further explored in moderate-advanced CKD.

TI  - Iron status and benefit of the use of parenteral iron therapy in pre-dialysis 
      Chronic Kidney disease patients.
PG  - 299-304
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Anaemia is a major cardiovascular risk factor in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). Treatment and correction of anaemia leads to improvement of 
      cardiovascular status and quality of life of patients with CKD. This 
      interventional open labeled randomised controlled study comparing the effect of 
      intravenous and oral iron therapy in improving red cell indices and iron status 
      in anaemic pre-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease was carried out to determine iron 
      status in anaemic pre-dialysis CKD patients to assess the benefit of parenteral 
      iron supplementation as against empirical oral iron in CKD patients with iron 
      deficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive pre-dialysis chronic kidney 
      disease patients attending the renal clinic over a six month period were 
      screened. Forty- one subjects (68.3%) were found to be anaemic and were 
      subsequently studied. RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged between 19 and 71 
      years with a mean age of 39 years. The mean serum creatinine and mean creatinine 
      clearance were 201.80 (70.25)?mol/L and 37.90 (± 12.17)ml/minute respectively. 
      The haematocrit concentration was found to correlate inversely with the level of 
      serum creatinine and 56.1% of the anaemic patients had iron deficiency. The mean 
      PCV rise in the intravenous iron group was 2.42 (± 1.98)% and this was 
      statistically significant (p=0.002) while the mean PCV difference was 0.909 (± 
      0.94)% in the oral iron group. Intravenously administered iron alone permitted 
      anaemia correction in about one-third of these patients without any life 
      threatening adverse drug event. CONCLUSION: Anaemia is very common in the 
      pre-dialysis CKD population and the prevalence of iron deficiency is high. 
      Intravenous iron supplementation is an effective and safe treatment for the 
      anaemia in the pre-dialysis CKD patients. Response to oral iron was poor.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: No studies have examined the association among serum hepcidin, 
      iron indices, or anemia status based on the kidney function of non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. METHODS: We reviewed data of 2238 patients 
      from a large-scale multicenter prospective Korean study (2011-2016) and excluded 
      198 patients with missing data regarding serum hepcidin, hemoglobin, transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT), ferritin, and usage of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) 
      or supplemental iron and 363 patients using ESA or supplemental iron. Finally, 
      1677 patients were included. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 53.5 years, and 
      65.4% were men. TSAT and serum hepcidin were significantly associated with anemia 
      status, whereas serum ferritin was not, regardless of anemia severity. For 
      patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
      a 10% increase of TSAT was associated with hemoglobin <13 g/dL (odds ratio [OR], 
      0.628; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.515-0.765; P<0.001) and hemoglobin <11.5 
      g/dL (OR, 0.672; 95% CI, 0.476-0.950; P=0.024), whereas a 10-ng/mL increase of 
      serum hepcidin was associated with hemoglobin <11.5 g/dL (OR, 1.379; 95% CI, 
      1.173-1.620; P<0.001) and hemoglobin <10.0 g/dL (OR, 1.360; 95% CI, 1.115-1.659; 
      P=0.002) for patients with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to multivariate 
      logistic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: TSAT was associated with less severe anemia in 
      early CKD patients. Serum hepcidin was associated with more severe anemia in 
      advanced CKD patients.

TI  - Effects of Ferric Citrate in Patients with Nondialysis-Dependent CKD and Iron 
      Deficiency Anemia.
PG  - 1851-1858
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2016101053 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency anemia is common and consequential in nondialysis-dependent CKD 
      (NDD-CKD). Efficacy and tolerability of conventional oral iron supplements are 
      mixed; intravenous iron administration associates with finite but important 
      risks. We conducted a randomized double-blind clinical trial in adults with 
      NDD-CKD and iron deficiency anemia to compare the safety and efficacy of oral 
      ferric citrate (n=117) and placebo (n=115). The primary end point was the 
      proportion of patients who achieved a ≥1.0 g/dl increase in hemoglobin at any 
      time during a 16-week randomized period. Patients who completed the 16-week 
      period could also participate in an 8-week open-label extension period. 
      Significantly more patients randomized to ferric citrate achieved the primary end 
      point (61 [52.1%] versus 22 [19.1%] with placebo; P<0.001). All secondary end 
      points reached statistical significance in the ferric citrate group, including 
      the mean relative change in hemoglobin (0.84 g/dl; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 
      to 1.10 g/dl; P<0.001) and the proportion of patients who achieved a sustained 
      increase in hemoglobin (≥0.75 g/dl over any 4-week period during the randomized 
      trial; 57 [48.7%] versus 17 [14.8%] with placebo; P<0.001). Rates of serious 
      adverse events were similar in the ferric citrate (12.0%) and placebo groups 
      (11.2%). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events, with 
      diarrhea reported in 24 (20.5%) and 19 (16.4%) and constipation in 22 (18.8%) and 
      15 (12.9%) patients treated with ferric citrate and placebo, respectively. 
      Overall, in patients with NDD-CKD, we found oral ferric citrate to be a safe and 
      efficacious treatment for iron deficiency anemia.

TI  - Recovery Of Bone And Muscle Mass In Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease And Iron 
      Overload On Hemodialysis And Taking Combined Supplementation With Curcumin And 
      Resveratrol.
PG  - 2055-2062
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S223805 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malnutrition is common in haemodialysis patients and closely 
      related to morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the effect of twelve weeks of 
      supplementation with resveratrol and curcumin on recovery of bone and muscle mass 
      and protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation on patients with chronic kidney disease 
      and iron overload undergoing hemodialysis, we performed a randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: We included a total of 40 
      patients, were randomly assigned to two groups, 20 to the group with antioxidant 
      supplementation (Resveratrol + Curcumin) (Group A), treated with a daily oral 
      dose of 500 mg of Resveratrol and 500 mg of Curcumin, and 20 to the control group 
      treated with placebo (Group B). RESULTS: Significant differences were found in 
      the body composition of the patients between both groups. There was a significant 
      difference in Body Mass Index (BMI) values (p = 0.002), fat percentage (p = 
      0.007), muscle mass (p = 0.01) bone mass (p = 0.01), as well as in the score of 
      the subjective global evaluation (p = 0.03). Also differences were found between 
      the basal and final serum levels of Triglycerides (TG) (p = 0.01), VLDL (p = 
      0.003). A significant decrease in the levels of serum ferritin (2003.69 ± 518.73 
      vs 1795.65 ± 519.00 ng/mL; p = 0.04). Nor were significant differences observed 
      between the baseline and the final Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances 
      (TBARS) values (70.45 ± 69.21 vs 50.19 ± 32.62, p = 0.24). The same results was 
      obtained for carbonyl values (2.67 ± 0.75 vs 2.50 ± 0.85; p = 0.50). DISCUSSION: 
      The present study is the first assay on patients with chronic kidney disease and 
      iron overload that demonstrates the beneficial effects of combined 
      supplementation with Curcumin and Resveratrol on muscle and bone mass. There was 
      a significant decrease in circulating levels of ferritin, to finding that 
      remarkably novel.

TI  - The effects of oral iron supplementation on the progression of anemia and renal 
      dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 472-9
AB  - AIMS: Oral iron traditionally has been administered to patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). However, there are limited data on the effect of oral iron 
      in CKD patients. Here, we evaluate the effects of oral iron therapy on renal 
      anemia and progression of renal disease in CKD patients. METHODS: Anemic patients 
      with nondialytic CKD who were naive to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) 
      were recruited for the prospective observational study. The participants were 
      classified into oral iron or control group, and they were asked to keep their 
      treatment status for 1 year. The primary outcomes were change in Hb and estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: A total of 182 participants were 
      enrolled and 138 completed a 12-month follow-up. No change in Hb level was 
      observed during the follow-up period in the iron group, whereas a significant 
      decrease in Hb was observed in the control group. Oral iron supplementation was 
      effective, especially in patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. The changes in 
      eGFR did not differ between the two groups. The incidences of drug-related 
      adverse events were equivalent in two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral iron 
      supplementation might attenuate the progression of anemia in nondialytic CKD 
      patients without ESAs and not impact kidney function.

TI  - Intravenous iron administration is associated with reduced platelet counts in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 20-3
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12218 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: In the management of anaemia associated with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), optimal use of intravenous (i.v.) iron has a central role. 
      It minimizes reliance on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and may be 
      beneficial in reducing overall cardiovascular risks through its effects on 
      platelet counts (PLT). We have examined the effects of i.v. iron on PLT in 
      patients with CKD. METHODS: Two hundred and three patients with CKD, referred to 
      a single teaching hospital in UK for i.v. iron therapy, received low 
      molecular-weight iron dextran at a median dose of 1000 milligrams given over a 
      median time of 2 h and 40 min. PLT at baseline were compared with the 
      measurements taken during a 4-month follow-up period post-infusion. RESULTS: PLT 
      were checked at various points following i.v. iron treatment. Compared with 
      baseline, mean reduction in PLT ranged between 10.1 and 23.6 (×10(9) /L) during 
      consecutive 15-days intervals post-treatment. At the reference point of 90-days 
      post-infusion, the drop in PLT was statistically significant (P < 0.001). WHAT IS 
      NEW AND CONCLUSION: Low molecular-weight iron dextran in patients with CKD leads 
      to reduction in PLT. This reduction appears soon after treatment and is maximal 
      after 3 months. Prospective data are required to confirm these findings and 
      examine whether this translates to a reduction in thrombotic episodes.

TI  - Iron absorption and phosphate-lowering effects of ferric citrate hydrate are not 
      influenced by gastric acid secretion inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease: a retrospective post hoc analysis.
PG  - 141-150
LID - 10.1007/s11255-022-03287-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ferric citrate hydrate (FC), an oral iron product is approved as iron 
      preparation for iron deficiency anemia and phosphate binder for chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). We investigated whether gastric acid secretion inhibitors (GASI) 
      influenced on iron absorption and phosphate-lowering effects of FC. METHODS: Two 
      phase 3 studies of FC for treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients 
      (non-dialysis-dependent, 12 weeks, and hemodialysis, 52 weeks), were 
      retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into with or without concomitant 
      GASI and levels of iron- and phosphate-related parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      In non-dialysis study (FC, 60 patients; placebo, 30 patients), 14 FC patients and 
      14 placebo patients used GASI. No significant differences were found between the 
      FC and placebo groups for adjusted mean differences (95% CI) of changes from 
      baseline to end of treatment (EOT) in serum ferritin [104.84 ng/mL (35.97, 
      173.71) with GASI vs 145.30 ng/mL (96.34, 194.25) without GASI, P = 0.34], and 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) [12.56% (- 0.83, 25.95) with GASI vs 18.56% (8.15, 
      28.98) without GASI, P = 0.49]. In hemodialysis study, 95/180 patients used GASI. 
      Mean changes (SD) from baseline to EOT in serum ferritin were 166.32 ng/mL 
      (153.70) with GASI and 155.16 ng/mL (139.47) without GASI, and for TSAT were 
      16.60% (19.44) with GASI and 16.02% (18.81) without GASI. In both studies, there 
      were no differences in the changes from baseline to EOT in serum phosphate 
      between with and without GASI cohorts. CONCLUSION: GASI did not influence on the 
      changes in serum ferritin, TSAT and serum phosphate by FC administration.

TI  - Towards a Common Definition for the Diagnosis of Iron Deficiency in Chronic 
      Inflammatory Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/nu14051039 [doi]
LID - 1039
AB  - Iron deficiency (ID) in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases is frequent. 
      However, under-diagnosis is also frequent due to the heterogeneity between 
      guidelines from different medical societies. We applied a common definition for 
      the diagnosis of ID to a large panel of patients with cancer, heart failure (HF), 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD), where ID was 
      defined as serum ferritin concentration <100 μg/L and/or a transferrin saturation 
      (TSAT) index <20%. Prevalence estimates using this common definition were 
      compared with that obtained with officially accepted definitions (ESMO 2018, ESC 
      2016, ECCO 2015, and ERBP 2013). For that purpose, we used data collected during 
      the French CARENFER studies, which included 1232, 1733, 1090, and 1245 patients 
      with cancer, HF, IBD, and CKD, respectively. When applying the common definition, 
      ID prevalence increased to 58.1% (vs. 57.9%), 62.8% (49.6%), and 61.2% (23.7%) in 
      cancer, HF, and IBD patients, respectively. Both prevalence estimates were 
      similar (47.1%) in CKD patients. Based on our results, we recommend combining 
      both ferritin concentration and TSAT index to define ID in patients with chronic 
      inflammatory diseases. In those patients, adopting this common definition of ID 
      should contribute to a better screening for ID, whatever the condition.

TI  - Role of Ferric Citrate in Hyperphosphatemia and Iron Deficiency Anemia in Non 
      Dialysis CKD Patients.
PG  - 53-56
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Disorders of mineral and bone metabolism in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular calcification and 
      osteoporosis. Anemia has been associated with progressive loss of kidney function 
      and increased mortality. Ferric citrate was recently developed, primarily as a 
      novel oral, non-calcium phosphate binder, which has also shown to replenish the 
      iron deficient state of the CKD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective 
      study was done on 40 pre-dialysis adult patients of CKD (stage 3-5) from a 
      tertiary care centre in North India. Patients on intravenous iron, erythropoietin 
      stimulating agents or other phosphate binders were excluded from the study. All 
      the patients were given tablet ferric citrate (each tablet containing ferric 
      citrate 1.1 gm equivalent to ferric iron 210 mg) in a dose of 3 tablets per day 
      for three months. Patients were followed up at two weekly intervals and relevant 
      investigations were done. They were divided into three groups according to their 
      CKD stages for subgroup analysis. OBSERVATIONS: After three months of therapy 
      with ferric citrate there was a significant decrease in mean serum phosphate from 
      6.55±0.70 mg/dl at baseline to 4.36±0.50 mg/dl at the end of three months 
      (p<0.001). Mean hemoglobin increased from 7.92±1.05 g/dl at baseline to 
      10.96±1.04 g/dl at the end of three months (p<0.001). Serum ferritin and serum 
      transferrin saturation increased from 278.25±110.56 ng/dl, 25.02±4.03 % at 
      baseline to 401.24±152.47 ng/dl and 29.62±3.77 % at the end of three months. The 
      mean serum vitamin D and serum iPTH levels, at baseline and at the end of 3 
      months were 14.61±10.80 ng/ml, 509.48±210.75 pg/ml and 23.65±14.00 ng/ml, 
      424.14±173.18 pg/ml respectively. The change in all these parameters were 
      significant irrespective of the CKD stages. CONCLUSION: The present study has 
      shown that ferric citrate is an effective and well tolerated phosphate binder, 
      which also significantly improves hematologic parameters in an iron deficient CKD 
      patient.

TI  - Iron status in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease.
PG  - 507-515
LID - 10.24425/122625 [doi]
AB  - In humans, iron deficiency represents a relevant occurrence in heart failure 
      (HF), with or without anaemia, and is associated with the worst outcome. 
      Moreover, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-known comorbidity of HF and is 
      strongly associated with the risk of developing anaemia. The most common cause of 
      HF in dogs is myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). To the best of our 
      knowledge, no studies have examined the iron status in dogs with HF, with and 
      without CKD. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the iron status 
      in dogs affected by MMVD and how strong is the relation with HF. The 
      retrospective study included 54 dogs with complete case records, echocardiography 
      and laboratory analyses. Iron status was evaluated by measuring serum iron 
      concentration (SIC), un- saturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), total iron 
      binding capacity (TIBC), and percentage of saturation (%SAT). The prevalence of 
      dogs showing low serum iron concentration (SIC) was 18% in the whole population, 
      33% in symptomatic patients, 100% in dogs with acute decompensated HF. No signif- 
      icant differences in SIC, UIBC, TIBC and %SAT median values were found among dogs 
      classi- fied in different ACVIM (American College of Veterinary Internal 
      Medicine) classes, between symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients, and among 
      IRIS (International Renal Interest Soci- ety) classes. Azotemic and non-azotemic 
      patients presented a significant difference in SIC mean values (p=0.02). 
      Generalised linear model (GLM) revealed that dogs with low SIC were at high- er 
      risk of being included in a higher ACVIM class (OR=6.383, p-value=0.014). 
      Log-rank analysis showed shorter survival in dogs with low SIC (p=0.020), 
      multivariate Cox analysis revealed that only HF symptoms can affect survival.

TI  - Effects of oral iron and calcium supplement on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of molidustat: an oral HIF-PH inhibitor for the treatment of 
      renal anaemia.
PG  - 185-197
LID - 10.1007/s00228-019-02813-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The present studies assessed the drug-drug interaction of molidustat, a 
      hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, with iron and calcium 
      supplements, which are common medications in patients with anaemia due to chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Forty-two healthy men received molidustat alone 
      (fasted or fed) or combined with oral iron(II) or calcium(II), given immediately 
      before or between 4 h before and 1 h after molidustat in three randomized, 
      open-label, crossover studies (12-15 participants per study). Molidustat AUC and 
      C(max) were assessed as the main pharmacokinetic parameters, and endogenous 
      erythropoietin (EPO) was measured to evaluate pharmacodynamics. RESULTS: 
      Depending on prandial state, concomitant intake of iron(II) reduced molidustat 
      AUC and C(max) by 50-75% and 46-84%, respectively, and EPO AUC((0-24)) and C(max) 
      by 31-44% and 36-48%, respectively. The influence of iron(II) declined with 
      increasing the time interval to the intake of molidustat, with reductions in 
      molidustat AUC and C(max) of 9% and 10%, respectively, when iron(II) intake 
      occurred 4 h before molidustat. Accordingly, effects on endogenous EPO were less 
      pronounced with increased time separation between oral iron(II) and molidustat 
      intake. Calcium(II) reduced molidustat AUC and C(max) by 15% and 47%, 
      respectively, without influence on EPO response. All treatments were well 
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to concomitant oral intake of calcium, the 
      effect of oral iron supplements on molidustat pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics should be considered, and the two agents should be administered 
      with an appropriate time separation.

TI  - Iron infusion and deposition in the kidney.
PG  - 237-40
LID - 10.5414/CN107361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parenteral iron therapy is the mainstay of treating iron deficiency 
      anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. METHODS: Retrospective case 
      study of iron staining of renal tissues in 2 CKD patients who had received 
      intravenous iron prior to the renal biopsy. RESULTS: Following the infusion of 
      ferumoxytol, iron staining of renal biopsy demonstrated blue curvilinear 
      deposition of iron in the tissue macrophages (histocytes) and interstitium of the 
      kidney. Renal iron deposition was not observed in a patient administered 
      intravenous iron dextran. CONCLUSION: We postulate that the higher molecular 
      weight of ferumoxytol and different carbohydrate components may lead to 
      deposition and trapping of the ironcarbohydrate complexes in the 
      reticuloendothelial system of the kidney. Potential renal toxicity from iron 
      induced oxidant stress, especially in patients with underlying chronic kidney 
      disease, merits further investigation.

TI  - Inflammation and functional iron deficiency regulate fibroblast growth factor 23 
      production.
PG  - 135-46
LID - S0085-2538(15)00028-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1038/ki.2015.290 [doi]
AB  - Circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are elevated in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the mechanisms are poorly 
      understood. Here we tested whether inflammation and iron deficiency regulate 
      FGF23. In wild-type mice, acute inflammation induced by single injections of 
      heat-killed Brucella abortus or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) decreased serum iron 
      within 6 h, and was accompanied by significant increases in osseous Fgf23 mRNA 
      expression and serum levels of C-terminal FGF23, but no changes in intact FGF23. 
      Chronic inflammation induced by repeated bacteria or IL-1β injections decreased 
      serum iron, increased osseous Fgf23 mRNA, and serum C-terminal FGF23, but 
      modestly increased biologically active, intact FGF23 serum levels. Chronic iron 
      deficiency mimicked chronic inflammation. Increased osseous FGF23 cleavage rather 
      than a prolonged half-life of C-terminal FGF23 fragments accounted for the 
      elevated C-terminal FGF23 but near-normal intact FGF23 levels in inflammation. 
      IL-1β injection increased Fgf23 mRNA and C-terminal FGF23 levels similarly in 
      wildtype and Col4a3(ko) mice with CKD but markedly increased intact FGF23 levels 
      only in the CKD mice. Inflammation increased Fgf23 transcription by activating 
      Hif1α signaling. Thus, inflammation and iron deficiency stimulate FGF23 
      production. Simultaneous upregulation of FGF23 cleavage in osteocytes maintains 
      near-normal levels of biologically active, intact circulating FGF23, whereas 
      downregulated or impaired FGF23 cleavage may contribute to elevated intact serum 
      FGF23 in CKD.

TI  - Effect of ferric citrate hydrate on FGF23 and PTH levels in patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease with normophosphatemia and iron 
      deficiency.
PG  - 789-796
LID - 10.1007/s10157-017-1510-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with normophosphatemia with chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) increase 
      urinary phosphate excretion while maintaining serum phosphate within the normal 
      range. Recent reports have shown that, in this stage, phosphate binders do not 
      decrease serum FGF23 and PTH levels. Iron deficiency promotes transcription of 
      FGF23 and iron-supplementation for iron deficiency decreases serum FGF23 levels. 
      We hypothesized that ferric citrate hydrate, an iron-based phosphate binder, will 
      decrease serum FGF23 levels in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD with 
      normophosphatemia and iron deficiency. METHODS: This was a single-center, 
      randomized, open-label interventional study. The inclusion criteria were as 
      follows: (1) eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), (2) normophosphatemia, (3) iron 
      deficiency. Patients were assigned to the following groups: ferric citrate 
      hydrate (FCH)-group, sodium ferrous citrate (SFC)-group, and control-group. After 
      12 weeks of intervention, we evaluated serum FGF23 levels and CKD-mineral bone 
      disorder markers. RESULTS: There were 17 patients in the FCH-group, 14 in the 
      SFC-group, and 9 in the control-group. The serum ferritin levels increased in the 
      FCH-group and SFC-group compared with baseline. Serum FGF23 levels were 
      unchanged; the change in the FCH-group was from 52.91 RU/mL (42.48-72.91) to 
      40.00 RU/mL (30.30-58.13) (P = 0.1764). However, in the FCH-group, serum PTH 
      levels significantly decreased compared with baseline, from 68.00 pg/mL 
      (49.00-141.00) to 60.00 pg/mL (44.00-144.00) (P = 0.0101). CONCLUSION: Iron-based 
      phosphate binder did not decrease serum FGF23 levels, but decreased serum PTH 
      levels.

AB  - The FDA first licensed erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) for use in 
      patients with ESRD in 1989. Hemoglobin targets for treatment with ESAs were 
      established at the outset on the basis of descriptive pre-ESA literature and 
      Phase I-III data in patients with ESRD. Postrelease literature in ESA-treated 
      patients accumulating over time initially supported improvement in indices of 
      both cardiovascular and other organ function as well as quality of life with 
      therapy. Recommended treatment targets for hemoglobin would evolve further in the 
      United States from four iterations of evidence- and opinion-based practice 
      guidelines appearing between 1997 and 2007. Several randomized, controlled trials 
      published from 1998 to 2009 examined normalization and near-normalization of 
      hemoglobin in patients with both ESRD and CKD; they raised fundamental questions 
      as to the safety of robust correction of anemia. These findings, taken together 
      with subsequent actions of the FDA in ESA labeling and CMS's quality expectations 
      for hemoglobin in payment for dialysis treatments, would result in a 
      comprehensive reassessment of the hemoglobin targets in ESA therapy. A marked 
      decrease in both national ESA utilization and hemoglobin attainment has ensued as 
      a result. This discussion addresses the history of the striking changes in 
      enthusiasm for hemoglobin-targeted anemia therapy from 1989 to the present, and 
      similarly examines the evolution of ferritin-targeted iron administration, which 
      has followed different-and markedly slower-historical development.

TI  - Oral and intravenous iron treatment alter the gut microbiome differentially in 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 759-767

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often complicated by anemia, which 
      seriously affects the quality-of-life and prognosis of patients. These patients 
      usually need iron replacement therapy. Oral iron affects the composition and 
      abundance of intestinal flora by increasing intestinal iron concentration. 
      METHODS: We undertook an interventional study to investigate the effects of oral 
      versus intravenous iron therapy on the gut microbiota. Oral ferrous succinate 
      tablets (n = 14) or intravenous iron sucrose (n = 14) was administered to anemic 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients for 2 months. RESULTS: Oral and 
      intravenous iron treatments had different effects on gut microbial composition 
      and diversity. After oral iron treatment, the α-diversity was decreased, while at 
      the phylum level, the abundance of Firmicutes was reduced and the abundance of 
      Bacteroides was increased. At the genus level, the abundance of Blautia and 
      Coprococcus was decreased, and the abundance of Bacteroidetes was increased. Oral 
      iron therapy was associated with a higher abundance of Lactobacillus compared 
      with that measured in intravenous iron-treated patients. According to metagenome 
      function prediction analysis, oral iron increased the metabolic processes of 
      phenylalanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. These changes may increase uremic 
      toxin levels, thereby increasing the progression of renal disease. CONCLUSION: 
      Iron therapy affects the diversity and composition of gut flora in MHD patients. 
      Oral iron affects the number of bacteria and increases amino acid metabolism 
      compared with intravenous iron. These results indicate that intravenous iron may 
      be more appropriate for MHD patients.

TI  - Oxidative stress and renal injury with intravenous iron in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 2279-89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron is widely prescribed in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and can cause oxidative stress. The relationship of oxidative 
      stress and renal injury in patients with CKD is unknown. Whether renal injury can 
      occur at a time point when transferrin is incompletely saturated is also unclear. 
      METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel group trial to compare 
      the oxidative stress induced by intravenous administration of 100 mg iron sucrose 
      over 5 minutes and its protection with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in 20 subjects with 
      stage 3 or 4 CKD. Transferrin saturation was measured with urea polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis, oxidative stress by malondialdehyde (MDA) measurement by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography, and renal injury by enzymuria and 
      proteinuria. Reduced and oxidized glutathione and free radical scavengers as well 
      as urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were also measured. RESULTS: 
      Parenteral iron increased plasma concentration and urinary excretion rate of MDA, 
      a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, within 15 to 30 minutes of iron sucrose 
      administration. This was accompanied by enzymuria and increase in proteinuria. In 
      contrast, saturation of transferrin was not maximally seen until 3 hours after 
      the end of infusion. Oxidative stress, enzymuria and proteinuria were transient 
      and were completely resolved in 24 hours. NAC reduced acute generation of 
      systemic oxidative stress but failed to abrogate proteinuria or enzymuria. 
      CONCLUSION: Intravenous iron produces oxidative stress that is associated with 
      transient proteinuria and tubular damage. The rapid production of oxidative 
      stress even when transferrin is not completely saturation suggests free iron 
      independent mechanism(s) to be operative in producing oxidative stress and 
      transient renal injury. Long-term implications of these findings need further 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is one of the main complications of chronic kidney disease 
      especially kidney failure, which includes treatment with 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplementation, including intravenous 
      and oral iron. However, intravenous iron may pose limitations, such as potential 
      infusion reactions. Oral iron is mainly composed of divalent iron, which can 
      excessively stimulate the gastrointestinal tract. Iron polysaccharide complex 
      capsules are a novel oral iron trivalent supplement with higher iron content and 
      lower gastrointestinal irritation. However, since high-quality evidence-based 
      medicinal support is lacking, it is necessary to conduct clinical studies to 
      further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral iron polysaccharide complex 
      in chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial 
      uses an open-label, parallel group design, where the efficacy and safety of 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) participants is evaluated. The experimental group 
      is assigned erythropoietins and iron polysaccharide complex (two capsules each 
      time, bid), and the control group is assigned erythropoietin and sucrose iron 
      (100mg, 2w) injection. Participants (aged 18-75 years) undergoing maintenance 
      hemodialysis were considered for screening. Inclusion criteria included 
      hemoglobin (Hb) ≥110g/L and < 130g/L, transferrin saturation (TSAT) > 20% and < 
      50%, and serum ferritin (SF) > 200μg/L and < 500μg/L. Exclusion criteria included 
      acute or chronic bleeding, serum albumin < 35g/L, hypersensitive C-reactive 
      protein (HsCRP) > 10 mg/L, and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (iPTH ≥ 800 
      pg/mL). Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the "Methods" 
      section. The primary endpoint is TSAT of the participants at week 12. Secondary 
      endpoints include Hb, SF, hematocrit (Hct), HsCRP, pharmacoeconomic evaluation, 
      drug costs, quality of life, and indicators of oxidative stress. The treatment 
      will last for 24 weeks with a follow-up visit at baseline (within 7 days prior to 
      initial treatment) and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 after initial treatment. 
      This clinical research includes 9 hemodialysis centers in mainland China and 
      plans to enroll 186 participants. DISCUSSION: It is expected that it will provide 
      strong evidence to reveal the clinical efficacy and safety of oral iron in the 
      treatment of chronic CKD-related anemia in MHD patients through this clinical 
      trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2000031166 .

AB  - AIM: Anaemia is prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and induces significant 
      changes in heart and kidney. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between 
      iron metabolism, hepcidin and inflammation focusing on left ventricular (LV) 
      function, in a remnant kidney rat model. METHODS: Rats with 5/6 subtotal 
      nephrectomy (STNx) and sham operation. Haemoglobin (Hb), serum iron (SI), 
      fractional shortening (FS%) by echocardiograms were evaluated. Six months after 
      STNx, the heart and kidney were processed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies 
      against hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1alpha, erythropoietin (EPO), 
      pro-hepcidin, caspase-3, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin 
      (IL)-6. RESULTS: Hb (g/dL) STNx: 10.8 +/- 0.8, sham: 14.7 +/- 0.6 (P < 0.01); SI 
      (microg/dL) STNx: 154.5 +/- 24.5, sham: 287.5 +/- 32.1 (P < 0.01); heart weight 
      (g) STNx: 2.21 +/- 0.15, sham: 1.12 +/- 0.12 (P < 0.01); FS% STNx: 28.4 +/- 2.5, 
      sham: 45.1 +/- 4.1 (P < 0.01). There was a correlation between Hb and FS% (r = 
      0.95; P < 0.01) and between SI and FS% (r = 0.86; P < 0.01) in the STNx group. 
      Tissue ferritin was reduced in heart and in kidney in the STNx group (P < 0.01). 
      HIF-1alpha was expressed in cardiomyocytes (positive cells/area) STNx: 32 +/- 5, 
      sham: 4 +/- 1; and tubular cells in STNx group: 70 +/- 16, sham: 10 +/- 3, P < 
      0.01. Hepcidin (% staining/area) in heart STNx: 6.6 +/- 0.8, sham: 0.8 +/- 0.1; 
      in kidney STNx: 9.7 +/- 2.6, sham: 3.7 +/- 0.9, P < 0.01. EPO (% staining/area) 
      in heart STNx: 2.6 +/- 0.4, sham: 0.8 +/- 0.2; in kidney STNx: 10.2 +/- 1.4, 
      sham: 1.2 +/- 0.6; P < 0.01. In STNx group positive caspase-3, TNF-alpha and IL-6 
      were detected in heart and renal cells. CONCLUSION: Low LV performance is 
      associated with iron deficiency anaemia in rats with CKD. Furthermore, 
      overproduction of HIF-1alpha and the activation of caspase-3 seem to be 
      associated with iron deficiency and with inflammatory markers. Hepcidin seems to 
      plays a key role in this mechanism.

AB  - Intravenous (IV) iron and Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) are 
      recommended for anemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This 
      retrospective cohort study analyzed utilization patterns of IV iron and ESA in 
      patients over 18 years of age admitted to University Health System Hospitals with 
      a primary or secondary diagnosis of CKD between January 1, 2006 to December 31, 
      2008. A clustered binomial logistic regression using the GEE methodology was used 
      to identify predictors of IV iron utilization. Only 8% (n = 6678) of CKD patients 
      on ESA therapy received IV iron supplementation in university hospitals. Those 
      receiving iron used significantly less amounts of ESAs. Patient demographics 
      (age, race, primary payer), patient clinical conditions (admission status, 
      severity of illness, dialysis status), and physician specialty were identified as 
      predictors of IV iron use in CKD patients. Use of IV iron with ESAs was low 
      despite recommendations from consensus guidelines. The low treatment rate of IV 
      iron represents a gap in treatment practices and signals an opportunity for 
      healthcare improvement in CKD anemic patients.

BTI - Ferumoxytol versus Other Intravenous Iron Therapies for Anemia: A Review of the 
      Clinical and Cost-effectiveness and Guidelines – An Update
AB  - Ferumoxytol (Feraheme) is a colloidal superparamegnetic iron-carbohydrate complex 
      that was specifically designed to reduce immunological reactivity. It can be 
      rapidly administered (IV rate of 30–60 seconds) as a 510 mg dose with the second 
      IV injection administered two to eight days later. The federal Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) in the United States has listed ferumoxytol for the 
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA, characterized by iron deficiency) in 
      adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Health Canada has recently 
      placed restrictions on the use of ferumoxytol due to the potential for serious 
      allergic reactions. Therefore, this review was performed to assess the clinical 
      effectiveness and safety of ferumoxytol compared with other IV iron therapies for 
      patients with IDA. In addition, cost-effectiveness and evidence-based guidelines 
      were also investigated to determine the costs associated with ferumoxytol and its 
      use in patients with IDA. This is an update to a previous review on ferumoxytol 
      which found limited evidence that stated that it seemed to have comparable 
      efficacy to other iron complexes but that it was associated with an increased 
      adverse event profile.

TI  - Comparison of serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities between iron 
      deficiency anemia patients and chronic kidney disease patients with anemia.
PG  - 781-6
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2016.1162080 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Altered paraoxonase (PON) and arylesterase (ARE) activities have been 
      shown in anemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and in iron deficiency 
      anemia (IDA) patients. Whether accompanying anemia alone is responsible for this 
      diminished PON and ARE activities in CKD patients or an additive factor for this 
      is not well studied. Therefore, we tried to clarify this issue here. METHODS: A 
      total of 82 subjects that consisted of 19 patients with IDA (group 1), 23 anemic 
      CKD patients (group 2), and 40 age and sex matched healthy subjects (group 3) 
      were enrolled. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), serum total thiol (-SH), 
      PON, and ARE activities of the participants were analyzed. RESULTS: Group 2 
      patients had significantly lowest serum levels of Total -SH, PON and ARE. Further 
      comparison showed that total -SH, PON and ARE levels were lower in group 1 than 
      group 3 (p = 0.0001 in both). Regarding comparison of group 1 and 2, only serum 
      ARE levels were significantly lower in group 2 (p = 0.001). PON activity was not 
      different between group 1 and group 2 whereas ARE activity was lower in group 2 
      than groups 1 and 3. In addition, correlation analysis showed that CIMT was 
      negatively correlated with PON and ARE. CONCLUSIONS: This markedly decreased ARE 
      activity in CKD patients, which could not be explained by the anemia alone, may 
      have a role in the pathogenesis of increased atherosclerosis in such patients. 
      Still further studies are needed to certain this.

PG  - 1033-7
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2014.918785 [doi]
AB  - There are limited data on total dose infusion (TDI) using iron dextran in 
      geriatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with iron-deficiency anemia 
      (IDA). Our goal was to evaluate the safety of TDI in this setting. We conducted a 
      retrospective chart review spanning a 5 year period (2002-2007), including all 
      patients with CKD and IDA who were treated with iron dextran TDI. Patient 
      demographics were noted, and laboratory values for creatinine, hemoglobin and 
      iron stores were recorded pre- and post-dose. TDI diluted in normal saline was 
      administered intravenously over 4-6 hours after an initial test dose. One hundred 
      fifty-three patients received a total of 250 doses of TDI (mean ± SD=971 ± 175 
      mg); age was 69 ± 12 years and creatinine 3.3 ± 1.9 mg/dL. All stages of CKD were 
      represented (stage 4 commonest). Hemoglobin and iron stores improved post-TDI 
      (P<0.001). None of the patients experienced an anaphylactic reaction or death. 
      Adverse events (AEs) were noted in 8 out of 250 administered doses (3.2%). The 
      most common AEs were itching, chills and back pain. One hundred and ten doses of 
      high molecular weight (HMW) iron dextran produced 6 AEs (5.45%), whereas 140 
      doses of low molecular weight (LMW) iron dextran produced 2 AEs (1.43%), a 
      non-significant trend (P=0.1433 by Fishers Exact Test). Iron dextran TDI is 
      relatively safe and effective in correcting IDA in geriatric CKD patients. Fewer 
      AEs were noted with the LMW compared to the HMW product. LMW iron dextran given 
      as TDI can save both cost and time, helping to alleviate issues of non-compliance 
      and patient scheduling.

      in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 151-164
LID - 10.1159/000528313 [doi]
AB  - Modern intravenous iron compounds (e.g., ferric carboxymaltose [FCM] and ferric 
      derisomaltose [FDI]) are utilized in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD). Product-specific 
      alterations in the metabolism of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) leading to 
      hypophosphatemia have been described for certain intravenous iron compounds, such 
      as FCM, with potential effects on bone and cardiovascular health and quality of 
      life. No prior head-to-head comparison between FCM and FDI exists in ND-CKD. This 
      single-center exploratory double-blind randomized controlled trial primarily 
      aimed to investigate the differential impact of FCM and FDI on FGF-23 and 
      phosphate in patients with iron deficiency +/- anemia and ND-CKD (stages 3a-5 - 
      serum ferritin &lt;200 μg/L or serum ferritin 200-299 μg/L and transferrin 
      saturation &lt;20%). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either FCM or FDI 
      over two infusions (1 month apart). Follow-up was 3 months. Measurements of serum 
      intact FGF-23, phosphate, vitamin D metabolites, parathyroid hormone, other bone 
      metabolism, cardiovascular, and quality of life markers were monitored. 168 
      patients were prescreened. Thirty-five patients were screened; 26 patients were 
      randomized. The mean (standard deviation) age was 67.9 (12.4) years and 17 
      participants were male. Most participants had stage 4 CKD (median [interquartile 
      range] estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]: 18.0 [11.3] mL/min/1.73 m2). 
      A higher than normal median (interquartile range) level of intact FGF-23 (212.1 
      [116.4] pg/mL) was noted. Serum phosphate was within normal range, while 
      parathyroid hormone was higher and 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D lower than the normal 
      range. The "Iron and Phosphaturia - ExplorIRON-CKD" trial will provide important 
      information regarding the differential effect of intravenous iron products in 
      terms of FGF-23, phosphate, and other markers of bone and cardiovascular 
      metabolism, alongside patient-reported outcome measures in patients with ND-CKD.

TI  - Treatment of iron deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease: A 
      prospective observational study of iron isomaltoside (NIMO Scandinavia) .

AB  - AIMS: Iron deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      Appropriate iron substitution is critical and intravenous iron is an established 
      therapy for these patients. The objective of this study was to assess treatment 
      routine, -effectiveness, and safety of iron isomaltoside (Monofer(®), 
      Pharma-cosmos A/S, Holbaek, Denmark) in CKD patients in clinical practice. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted in 
      predialysis CKD patients treated with iron isomaltoside according to the product 
      label and to routine clinical care. RESULTS: The study included 108 patients with 
      predialysis CKD: 22 were in stage 2 - 3, 41 in stage 4, and 45 in stage 5. The 
      mean (standard deviation) age was 67 (15) years, and 55% of patients were male. 
      The majority of patients (65%) received one iron isomaltoside treatment. In 
      patients with a baseline Hb < 10 g/dL, the mean dose of iron isomaltoside in the 
      study was lower than the estimated total iron requirement (567 mg versus 921 mg). 
      A treatment response of Hb ≥ 1 g/dL was achieved in 16/28 (57%) of patients, and 
      the mean post-treatment Hb level was 10.5 g/dL. The probability of retreatment 
      did not correlate with dose, but no dose administered was > 1,000 mg. There were 
      no serious adverse drug reactions. One non-serious adverse drug reaction - 
      injection site discoloration - was reported, and the patient had an uneventful 
      recovery. CONCLUSION: Iron isomaltoside shows a good effectiveness and safety 
      profile in predialysis CKD patients. However, some patients did not receive 
      adequate iron doses to allow for optimal correction of their iron deficiency 
      anemia.

TI  - Ferric carboxymaltose in patients with iron-deficiency anemia and impaired renal 
      function: the REPAIR-IDA trial.
PG  - 833-42
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-deficiency anemia in non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney 
      disease (NDD-CKD) frequently requires parenteral iron replacement, but existing 
      therapies often require multiple administrations. We evaluated the efficacy and 
      cardiovascular safety of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), a non-dextran parenteral 
      iron permitting large single-dose infusions, versus iron sucrose in patients with 
      iron-deficiency anemia and NDD-CKD. METHODS: A total of 2584 participants were 
      randomized to two doses of FCM 750 mg in one week, or iron sucrose 200 mg 
      administered in up to five infusions in 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint 
      was the mean change to highest hemoglobin from baseline to Day 56. The primary 
      composite safety endpoint included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial 
      infarction, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, 
      arrhythmias and hyper- and hypotensive events. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin 
      increase was 1.13 g/dL in the FCM group and 0.92 g/dL in the iron sucrose group 
      (95% CI, 0.13-0.28). Similar results were observed across all subgroups, except 
      Stage 2 CKD. More subjects in the FCM group achieved a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 
      1.0 g/dL between baseline and Day 56 (48.6 versus 41.0%; 95% CI, 3.6-11.6%). 
      There was no significant difference between FCM and iron sucrose recipients with 
      respect to the primary composite safety endpoint, including the major adverse 
      cardiac events of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. A significant 
      difference in the number of protocol-defined, predominantly transient 
      hypertensive episodes was observed in the FCM group. CONCLUSIONS: Two 750-mg 
      infusions of FCM are a safe and effective alternative to multiple lower dose iron 
      sucrose infusions in NDD-CKD patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

TI  - Effect of iron restriction on renal damage and mineralocorticoid receptor 
      signaling in a rat model of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2192-201
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283581a64 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iron is associated with the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). Activation of mineralocorticoid receptor signaling is implicated in CKD; 
      however, a link between iron and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in CKD 
      remains unknown. We have previously shown that long-term dietary iron restriction 
      leads to increased sodium and decreased potassium excretions in the rat urine. 
      Herein, we investigated the effect of iron restriction on renal damage and 
      mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in a rat model of CKD. METHODS: CKD was 
      induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in Sprague-Dawley rats. CKD rats were divided into 
      untreated and dietary iron-restricted groups. RESULTS: CKD rats exhibited 
      proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitinal damage, and podocyte injury. 
      In contrast, these changes were attenuated by 16 weeks of iron-restricted diet. 
      Consistent with these findings, iron restriction suppressed increased gene 
      expression of collagen type III, transforming growth factor-β, CD68, and tumor 
      necrosis factor-α in the CKD kidney. Importantly, increased expression of nuclear 
      mineralocorticoid receptor and SGK1, a key downstream effector of 
      mineralocorticoid receptor signaling, in the CKD kidney was markedly attenuated 
      by iron restriction. Of interest, expression of cellular iron transport proteins, 
      transferrin receptor 1, and divalent metal transporter 1 was increased in the CKD 
      renal tubules, along with increased iron accumulation, superoxide production, and 
      urinary iron excretion. CKD rats also developed hypertension, although iron 
      restriction suppressed the development of hypertension. CONCLUSION: Taken 
      together, these data uncover a novel effect of iron restriction on renal damage 
      and hypertension through the inhibition of renal mineralocorticoid receptor 
      signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of iron deficiency helps to improve cardiac and renal 
      function in patients with chronic heart failure. However, the mechanism by which 
      this occurs is currently unclear. METHODS: We undertook a double-blind, 
      randomised, placebo-controlled study of intravenous iron sucrose treatment 
      (200mg/mL weekly for five weeks) in patients with chronic heart failure, chronic 
      kidney disease and iron-deficiency anaemia receiving optimal treatment for 
      chronic heart failure (N=60). Markers of disease severity, iron status, anaemia 
      and inflammation were measured during a six-month follow-up period, and 
      evaluation of echocardiographic parameters was performed at baseline and six 
      months after treatment. RESULTS: At six months after treatment initiation, 
      intravenous iron was associated with reduced severity of the symptoms of chronic 
      heart failure and improved renal function (both p<0.001 versus control). Also, 
      ferritin and transferrin saturation levels were increased, as were haemoglobin 
      levels, whereas inflammatory markers were reduced (all p<0.001 versus control). 
      Left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters were increased and improved 
      left ventricular function correlated with iron status in patients receiving 
      intravenous iron but not patients in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous 
      iron treatment was associated with improved myocardial functional parameters and 
      cardiac dimensions in patients with anaemia and chronic kidney disease.

AB  - A regimen of a single high dose iron administration was initially adopted for 
      patients commencing haemodialysis (HD) treatment. Iron stores are established and 
      iron metabolism and erythropoiesis stabilise allowing haematinic parameters to be 
      more confidently assessed for use in anaemia management decisions. High doses of 
      IV iron delay the need for subsequent iron supplementation. A high-dose, 
      low-frequency iron infusion regimen for all HD patients was adopted. The outcomes 
      of administering this dosage regimen are reported as observational retrospective 
      analysis using patient record data in 2009. Patients received three [median; 
      semi-interquartile range (SIQR) 0.5] high-dose iron infusions during the year. 
      The median infusion dose was 1100 mg iron (SIQR 0.0) and the median amount of 
      iron received during the year by each patient was 3200 mg (SIQR 750). The median 
      haemoglobin (Hb) level prior to infusion was 108 g/l and post infusion 114 g/l; 
      ZHb = 2.656, p = 0.008). Ferritin levels increased from a median of 376 μg/l 
      preinfusion to 690 μg/l postinfusion; Zferritin =-4.796, p < 0.001. The median 
      time between infusions was 125 days (approximately four months). The 51 patients 
      (76%) who received three or less infusions within the study period received 2537 
      mg (mean) of iron. These findings indicate that both Hb and ferritin levels can 
      be adequately managed using a high-dose, low-frequency regimen of IV iron in 
      patients undergoing HD.

TI  - FDA report: Ferumoxytol for intravenous iron therapy in adult patients with 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 315-9
LID - 10.1002/ajh.21656 [doi]
AB  - On June 30, 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
      ferumoxytol (Feraheme injection, AMAG Pharmaceuticals), an iron-containing 
      product for intravenous (IV) administration, for the treatment of iron deficiency 
      anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The safety and 
      efficacy of ferumoxytol were assessed in three randomized, open-label, controlled 
      clinical trials. Two trials evaluated patients with nondialysis dependent CKD and 
      a third trial assessed patients undergoing hemodialysis. Randomization was either 
      to ferumoxytol or oral iron. Ferumoxytol was administered as two 510 mg IV 
      injections, separated by 3-8 days. Oral iron, Ferro-Sequels, was administered at 
      a dose of 100 mg twice daily for 21 days. In all three clinical trials, 
      ferumoxytol administration increased the mean blood hemoglobin (Hgb) 
      concentrations by approximately 1.0 g/dL over the 35 day period, a mean increase 
      that was greater than what was observed in patients receiving oral iron. Patients 
      receiving ferumoxytol also had increases in blood transferrin saturation (TSAT) 
      and ferritin values. For the proposed ferumoxytol dosing regimen, 4.9% of 
      patients had serum ferritin >or=800 ng/mL and TSAT >or=50% post-treatment. The 
      most important ferumoxytol safety concerns were hypersensitivity reactions and/or 
      hypotension. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions were reported in 0.2% of 
      subjects, and other adverse reactions potentially associated with 
      hypersensitivity (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria, or wheezing) were reported in 
      3.7%. Hypotension was observed in 1.9%, including three patients with serious 
      hypotensive reactions. Ferumoxytol administration may transiently affect the 
      diagnostic ability of magnetic resonance imaging and the drug label provides 
      further information regarding this effect.

TI  - Anaphylactic Shock Secondary to Intravenous Iron Sucrose in Chronic Kidney 
      Disease.
PG  - 391-3
LID - 10.1007/s12288-014-0475-0 [doi]
AB  - Intravenous (IV) iron is an essential component of therapy of anemia of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). We present a rare case in which iron sucrose was infused to 
      a patient of CKD and resulted in severe anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest minutes 
      after starting the infusion. He was aggressively resuscitated with adrenaline and 
      other measures following which he recovered. The use of parenteral iron is 
      associated with several adverse drug reactions (ADR) which were seen with 
      preparations like iron dextran but became rare with the use of newer safe 
      preparations like iron sucrose or gluconate. The ADR can be mild or can have 
      severe life threatening features like syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, 
      bronchospasm and rarely cardio respiratory arrest like in our case. Iron sucrose 
      is generally given as a IV infusion of 100-200 mg over 15-30 min and has a very 
      low rate of ADR even with higher doses or bolus injections. But still necessary 
      precautions and appropriate monitoring must be done in all patients. The patients 
      who are allergic to iron sucrose may be treated with other safer preparations or 
      by desensitisation techniques.

TI  - Iron deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease: potential role for 
      intravenous iron therapy independent of erythropoietin.
PG  - 719-23
AB  - The prevalence of iron deficiency and its contribution to the anemia of end stage 
      renal disease has been extensively studied, but much less is known about the role 
      of iron deficiency in the pathogenesis of the anemia of chronic kidney disease in 
      predialysis patients. All new hemodialysis patients entering a single 
      hemodialysis unit between July 1999 and April 2002 were included in the study. 
      The admission laboratory tests and the Health Care Financing Administration 
      (HCFA) 2728 form were examined to determine the prevalence of erythropoietin use, 
      anemia (Hb<11 g/dl), and iron deficiency (ferritin<100 ng/ml and transferrin 
      saturation %<20%). In a second part of the study, the effect of intravenous iron 
      gluconate replacement in patients with stage III & IV chronic kidney disease was 
      examined. Anemia was present in 68% of all patients starting hemodialysis. Iron 
      deficiency was a common feature occurring in 29% of patients taking 
      erythropoietin (49% of all patients) and 26% of patients without erythropoietin 
      (51% of all patients). Following the administration of intravenous iron gluconate 
      to four patients, there was a significant rise in hemoglobin levels from 
      10.6+/-0.19 to 11.7+/-g/dl (p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency is common in 
      predialysis patients. Replenishing iron stores in anemic patients with chronic 
      kidney disease significantly increases hemoglobin levels and should be considered 
      as an integral part of the therapy for treating anemia in the predialysis 
      population.

TI  - Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is associated with iron status 
      in anemic patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 28-34
LID - 10.1007/s10157-017-1409-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia is common in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a biomarker of 
      acute kidney injury, is known to be associated with iron metabolism. We 
      investigated whether plasma NGAL level is associated with iron status in 
      pre-dialysis CKD patients with anemia. METHODS: This study included 419 patients 
      who had anemia. The subjects were into categorized into a pre-dialysis group 
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), n = 288) and a 
      non-CKD group (eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), n = 131). The associations between 
      plasma NGAL and iron status (serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [TSAT]), 
      eGFR, albumin, uric acid, total cholesterol, calcium, phosphate, and C-reactive 
      protein (CRP) were assessed. RESULTS: In non-CKD group, plasma NGAL was not 
      associated with any baseline variables including iron indices (TSAT and serum 
      ferritin). In pre-dialysis group, univariate analysis showed plasma NGAL 
      correlated with eGFR, CRP, TSAT, and serum ferritin. In multivariate analysis, 
      plasma NGAL was independently associated with TSAT. However, serum ferritin lost 
      its association with plasma NGAL. In ROC analysis for identifying iron 
      deficiency, the plasma NGAL (best cut-off value ≤394 ng/ml) was superior to the 
      serum ferritin (suggested cut-off value ≤500 ng/ml) in both sensitivity and 
      specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma NGAL is associated with iron status in anemic 
      patients with pre-dialysis CKD. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the 
      role of plasma NGAL in assessing the iron deficiency and in guiding the iron 
      therapy for pre-dialysis CKD patients.

      with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 530-1
LID - 10.1038/ncpneph0913 [doi]
AB  - This Practice Point commentary discusses the findings and limitations of a phase 
      III trial by Spinowitz et al. that compared oral and intravenous iron therapies 
      in nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease. In total, 304 patients were 
      randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either two 510 mg doses of 
      intravenous ferumoxytol within 5+/-3 days or 200mg of elemental oral iron daily 
      for 21 days. At day 35, hemoglobin levels had increased significantly more in 
      patients who had received intravenous ferumoxytol than in those who had received 
      oral iron therapy. Ferumoxytol was well tolerated. The superiority of ferumoxytol 
      over other intravenous iron preparations, however, needs to be investigated, and 
      optimal serum ferritin levels for the nondialysis CKD population need to be 
      defined.

TI  - Can the response to iron therapy be predicted in anemic nondialysis patients with 
      chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 409-16
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04280609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Anemia is iron responsive in 30 to 50% of nondialysis 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the utility of bone marrow iron 
      stores and peripheral iron indices to predict the erythropoietic response is not 
      settled. We investigated the accuracy of peripheral and central iron indices to 
      predict the response to intravenous iron in nondialysis patients with CKD and 
      anemia. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A diagnostic study was 
      conducted on 100 nondialysis patients who had CKD and anemia and were 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and iron naive. Bone marrow iron stores were 
      evaluated by aspiration. Hemoglobin, transferrin saturation index (TSAT), and 
      ferritin were measured at baseline and 1 month after 1000 mg of intravenous iron 
      sucrose. Posttest predictive values for the erythropoietic response (> or =1-g/dl 
      increase in hemoglobin) of peripheral and central iron indices were calculated. 
      RESULTS: The erythropoietic response was noted in a higher proportion in bone 
      marrow iron-deplete than in iron-replete patients (63 versus 30%). Peripheral 
      iron indices had a moderate accuracy in predicting response. The positive (PPV) 
      and negative predictive values (NPV) were 76 and 72% for a TSAT of 15% and 74 and 
      70% for a ferritin of 75 ng/ml, respectively. In the final logistic regression 
      model, including TSAT and ferritin, the chances of a positive response increased 
      by 7% for each 1% decrease in TSAT. CONCLUSIONS: Because an erythropoietic 
      response is seen in half of patients and even one third of those with 
      iron-replete stores responded whereas peripheral indices had only a moderate 
      utility in predicting response, the therapeutic trial to intravenous iron seems 
      to be a useful tool in the management of anemia in nondialysis patients with CKD.

AB  - Objective. We aimed to demonstrate safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) low 
      molecular weight iron dextran (LMWID) during treatment of anemic stage 3 and 4 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods. Efficacy data was obtained by 
      retrospective chart review of 150 consecutively enrolled patients. Patients were 
      assigned per protocol to oral or IV iron, with IV iron given to those with lower 
      iron stores and/or hemoglobin. Iron and darbepoetin were administered to achieve 
      and maintain hemoglobin at 10-12 g/dL. Efficacy endpoints were mean hemoglobin 
      and change in iron indices approximately 30 and 60 days after enrollment. Safety 
      data was obtained by retrospective review of reported adverse drug events (ADEs) 
      following 1699 infusions of LMWID (0.5-1.0 g). Results. Mean hemoglobin, iron 
      saturation, and ferritin increased significantly from baseline to 60 days in 
      patients assigned to LMWID (hemoglobin: 11.3 versus 9.4 g/dL; iron saturation: 
      24% versus 12.9%; ferritin: 294.7 versus 134.7 ng/mL; all P  values < 0.0001). 
      Iron stores and hemoglobin were maintained in the group assigned to oral iron. Of 
      1699 iron dextran infusions, three ADEs occurred. Conclusions. Treatment of 
      anemia in CKD stages 3 and 4 with LMWID and darbepoetin is efficacious. The 
      serious ADE rate was 0.06% per infusion.

TI  - A prospective observational study of iron isomaltoside in haemodialysis patients 
      with chronic kidney disease treated for iron deficiency (DINO).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is frequent in haemodialysis (HD) patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), and intravenous iron is an established therapy for 
      these patients. This study assessed treatment routine, effectiveness, and safety 
      of iron isomaltoside (IIM) 5% (Diafer®) in a HD cohort. METHODS: This prospective 
      observational study included 198 HD patients converted from iron sucrose (IS) and 
      treated with IIM according to product label and clinical routine. Data for IIM 
      were compared to historic data for IS in 3-month intervals. The primary endpoint 
      was to show non-inferiority for IIM versus IS in haemoglobin (Hb) maintenance. 
      RESULTS: Most patients (> 60%) followed a fixed low-dose iron treatment protocol. 
      Three minutes were required for preparation and administration of IIM. 
      Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) was used in > 80% of patients during both 
      IIM and IS phases. The maintenance of Hb was similar with both iron drugs; the 
      mean Hb level was 11 g/dL, and the mean change of 0.3 g/dL (95% confidence 
      interval: 0.1, 0.5) for IIM 0-3 months compared to IS demonstrated 
      non-inferiority. Nine adverse drug reactions were reported in 2% of patients 
      administered IIM. All patients had uneventful recoveries. The frequency of 
      metallic taste was higher with IS compared to IIM (34% versus 0.5%, p < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: IIM is effective and well tolerated by CKD patients on HD. IIM was 
      non-inferior to IS in maintenance of Hb, and had similar ESA requirements. The 
      fast-push injection of IIM may enable logistical benefits in clinical practice, 
      and the low frequency of metallic taste contributes to patient convenience. TRIAL

LID - gin/33.4.13 [pii]
AB  - Several factors influence the choice of phosphate binder for patients, including 
      older age, male gender, post-menopause, diabetes, low bone turnover, 
      vascular/valvular calcification and inflammation. Unlike calcium-based phosphate 
      binders, non-calcium-based phosphate binders, such as sevelamer and lanthanum 
      carbonate, have been able to reduce the progression of bone disease to adynamic 
      bone among patients with CKD. New iron-based phosphate binders are now available. 
      With multiple options available for the reduction of phosphate, the focus has 
      been on agents that do not contain calcium. This is because it is thought that 
      calcium itself functions as a substrate for calcification.

TI  - Comparison of intravenous low molecular weight iron dextran and intravenous iron 
      sucrose for the correction of anaemia in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease 
      patients: a randomized single-centre study in Nigeria.
PG  - 817-822
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous low molecular weight iron dextran and iron sucrose have 
      been used for correction of iron deficiency for many years and have been shown to 
      improve anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is a paucity of 
      head to head comparisons of these parenteral iron preparations. Such comparative 
      efficacy data would be of particular interest in resource-limited African 
      countries, where the majority of CKD patients are unable to afford 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
      compare the effects of these two intravenous iron preparations in pre-dialysis 
      CKD patients. METHODS: Sixty-seven anaemic pre-dialysis CKD patients were 
      randomized to one of two treatment groups. The low molecular weight iron dextran 
      group (n = 33) received 1000 mg of low molecular weight iron dextran 
      intravenously in four divided doses of 250 mg. The iron sucrose group (n = 34) 
      received 1000 mg of iron sucrose intravenously in five divided doses of 200 mg. 
      Complete blood count, serum creatinine, serum iron, unsaturated iron binding 
      capacity, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were assessed at baseline. 
      The baseline parameters were repeated in all patients on Day 24. The primary 
      outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a rise in haemoglobin (Hb) 
      concentration of ≥1.0 g/dL after iron therapy. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference in the proportion of patients achieving the primary end point between 
      both arms of the study: [7 (21.9%) low molecular weight iron dextran versus 11 
      (32.4%) iron sucrose; relative risk 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      0.19-1.70; P = 0.23]. At Day 24, the mean increase in Hb concentration from 
      baseline was comparable between the two groups: low molecular weight iron dextran 
      0.4 ± 0.7 g/dL versus iron sucrose 0.6 ± 0.9 g/dL, mean difference 0.2 g/dL (95% 
      CI: -0.26-0.61; P = 0.28). The proportion of patients that experienced at least 
      one or more adverse events was 27.3% in the iron dextran group versus 14.7% in 
      the iron sucrose arm (P = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Both intravenous low molecular 
      weight iron dextran and intravenous iron sucrose are effective in correcting iron 
      deficiency and anaemia in pre-dialysis CKD patients.

TI  - Iron Regulation by Molidustat, a Daily Oral Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Prolyl 
      Hydroxylase Inhibitor, in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 243-254
LID - 10.1159/000502012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The current treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) includes the administration of erythropoiesis stimulating agents 
      (ESAs) combined with iron supplementation. Molidustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor 
      prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, has potential to treat anemia associated with CKD 
      through increased erythropoietin production and improved iron availability. Here, 
      we report the effect of molidustat on iron metabolism. METHOD: Parameters of iron 
      metabolism were monitored in three 16-week, randomized, controlled, phase 2 
      studies assessing the safety and efficacy of molidustat in the treatment of 
      anemia associated with CKD in different populations: treatment-naïve and 
      previously ESA-treated patients not on dialysis, and previously ESA-treated 
      patients on hemodialysis. Iron supplementation was left at the discretion of the 
      investigator. RESULTS: In treatment-naïve patients not on dialysis, transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT), hepcidin, ferritin, and iron concentrations decreased with 
      molidustat, whereas total iron binding capacity (TIBC) increased. Similar results 
      were observed in previously ESA-treated patients not on dialysis, although 
      changes in those parameters were larger in treatment-naïve than in previously 
      ESA-treated patients. In previously ESA-treated patients receiving hemodialysis, 
      hepcidin concentration and TIBC remained stable with molidustat, whereas TSAT and 
      ferritin and iron concentrations increased. Generally, similar trends were 
      observed in secondary analyses of subgroups of patients not receiving iron 
      supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Molidustat is a potential alternative to standard 
      treatment of anemia associated with CKD, with a different mechanism of action. In 
      patients not receiving dialysis, molidustat increases iron availability. In 
      patients receiving hemodialysis, further investigation is required to understand 
      fully the mechanisms underlying iron mobilization associated with molidustat.

AB  - Anaemia is a common in chronic kidney disease. Although erythropoietin and iron 
      supplementation are established treatments, knowledge on the use of IV iron alone 
      in patients not on dialysis or erythropoietin is incomplete. The responses of 82 
      patients referred to the renal anaemia service with haemoglobin of 11.5 g/dl or 
      less were assessed 1 week after completing four once weekly doses of 200 mg of 
      venofer. No patients were on dialysis or erythropoietin. The haemoglobin rise 1 
      week after treatment was 0.53 g/dl. Ferritin levels improved from 110.8 to 410.2 
      ng/l and transferrin saturation from 17.7 to 27.3%. Ferritin levels remained 
      below our target range (200-500 ng/l) in 7.7% while 25.6% had levels above this. 
      Ferritin levels remained less than 800 ng/l in nearly all patients. Intravenous 
      iron is cost effective and should be considered for use in patients with renal 
      anaemia. Patients with CKD stage 5 appeared to respond less well.

AB  - The relative safety of parenteral iron preparations is a controversial issue in 
      the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), as direct head-to-head 
      comparative trials are lacking. In this study, patients of CKD were randomized to 
      receive intravenous low molecular weight iron dextran (ID), sodium ferrigluconate 
      complex (SFGC), and iron sucrose (IS) at doses and infusion rates recommended by 
      the product manufacturer. One time test dose was used only for ID and SFGC. A 
      total of 2,980 injections (n = 339) of i.v. iron was given, and 49 patients 
      (14.45% per patient) and a total of 56 adverse events (1.88% per infusion) were 
      noted. Odds ratios (OR) of serious adverse drug events (ADE; i.e., death, 
      anaphylaxis, or suspected immuno-allergic events) per patient was not significant 
      between ID vs. SFGC (3.566) and SFGC vs. IS (2.129), whereas that between ID vs. 
      IS (7.594) was highly significant (p = 0.034). OR of serious ADE exposure was 
      significantly higher in ID vs. SFGC (OR = 5.670, p = 0.0147) and ID vs. IS (OR = 
      7.799, p < 0.001). No significant difference was seen between the three groups in 
      terms of non-serious ADEs. Drug discontinuation occurred significantly more often 
      with ID. One patient who developed anaphylactoid reaction with SFGC and ID 
      tolerated iron sucrose well.

      iron management.
PG  - 104-10
LID - 10.1038/ki.2008.526 [doi]
AB  - Serum ferritin levels are a proxy measure of iron stores; and existing guidelines 
      for managing anemia in hemodialysis patients suggest that serum ferritin 
      concentrations should be maintained at >200 ng/ml. The KDOQI recommendations 
      further state there is insufficient evidence advocating routine intravenous iron 
      when ferritin levels exceed 500 ng/ml. Here we determined the interassay 
      differences and short-term intraindividual variability of serum ferritin 
      measurements in patients on chronic hemodialysis to illustrate how these 
      variances may affect treatment decisions. Intermethod variations of up to 150 
      ng/ml were found comparing six commonly used ferritin assays that evaluated 
      thirteen pools of serum from hemodialysis and nonhemodialysis patients. The 
      intraindividual variability for ferritin in 60 stable hemodialysis patients 
      ranged between 2-62% measured over an initial two-week period and from 3-52% when 
      factored over a six-week period. Our results suggests that single serum ferritin 
      values should not be used to guide clinical decisions regarding treatment of 
      chronic hemodialysis patients with intravenous iron due to significant analytical 
      and intraindividual variability.

TI  - Iron suppresses erythropoietin expression via oxidative stress-dependent 
      hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha inactivation.
PG  - 555-566
LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2017.11 [doi]
AB  - Renal anemia is a major complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron 
      supplementation, as well as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, are widely used 
      for treatment of renal anemia. However, excess iron causes oxidative stress via 
      the Fenton reaction, and iron supplementation might damage remnant renal function 
      including erythropoietin (EPO) production in CKD. EPO gene expression was 
      suppressed in mice following direct iron treatment. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 
      alpha (HIF-2α), a positive regulator of the EPO gene, was also diminished in the 
      kidney of mice following iron treatment. Anemia-induced increase in renal EPO and 
      HIF-2α expression was inhibited by iron treatment. In in vitro experiments using 
      EPO-producing HepG2 cells, iron stimulation reduced the expression of the EPO 
      gene, as well as HIF-2α. Moreover, iron treatment augmented oxidative stress, and 
      iron-induced reduction of EPO and HIF-2α expression was restored by tempol, an 
      antioxidant compound. HIF-2α interaction with the Epo promoter was inhibited by 
      iron treatment, and was restored by tempol. These findings suggested that iron 
      supplementation reduced EPO gene expression via an oxidative 
      stress-HIF-2α-dependent signaling pathway.

TI  - Anemia in chronic renal disease: evaluation of inflammatory activity on 
      erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in patients not submitted to dialysis 
      treatment.
PG  - 695-704
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory activity is one of the factors involved in the 
      physiopathology of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
      majority of studies on anemia, inflammation, and disturbances of iron metabolism 
      have focused on patients in end-stage renal failure and dialysis therapy. 
      However, anemia and inflammation are present in patients in previous stages of 
      renal failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible influence 
      of inflammatory activity on erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in CKD patients 
      without dialytic treatment. METHODS: 114 CKD adult patients were studied. 
      Patients with anemia (n = 72) were compared with those without anemia (n = 46). 
      Anemic patients were classified as renal anemia (n = 46) or iron deficiency 
      anemia (n = 26). In addition the total group was analyzed according to the degree 
      of renal dysfunction. Iron status, erythropoiesis activity (soluble transferrin 
      receptor and erythropoietin determinations), and inflammatory activity 
      (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-lp, and neopterin determinations) 
      were measured using commercial kits. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-Y) was 
      also determined. RESULTS: Interleukin-6, interleukin-li, and neopterin 
      concentrations were higher in the anemic group when compared with those without 
      anemia and controls. There was no difference in C-reactive protein values between 
      CKD with and without anemia, although both of them had showed elevated levels 
      when compared with controls. Ret-Y values were lower in iron deficiency anemia 
      when compared with renal anemia and controls. An inverse correlation between 
      interleukin-6 and hemoglobin (r = -0.4287, p= 0.0002) was observed only in the 
      renal anemia group. It was observed that anemia has a tendency to worsen as renal 
      function deteriorates. Reticulocyte count was lower and neopterin concentrations 
      were higher in more advanced renal failure stages. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory 
      factors contribute to anemia in renal patients in all stages of renal failure. 
      High levels of neopterin in CKD patients suggest that neopterin contributes to 
      impaired erythropoietin production and anemia in CKD patients.

TI  - Iron isomaltoside 1000: a new intravenous iron for treating iron deficiency in 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 589-96
LID - 10.5301/JN.2011.6248 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often suffer from iron 
      deficiency anemia necessitating treatment with intravenous iron. This study was 
      designed to assess the safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer) in CKD 
      patients. The secondary objective was to assess its effect on iron deficiency 
      anemia. METHODS: This open-label, noncomparative, multicenter trial assigned 182 
      patients with CKD (n=161 in dialysis and n=21 in predialysis) to iron 
      isomaltoside 1000 either as 4 intravenous bolus injections of 100-200 mg iron per 
      dose or as a fast high-dose infusion at baseline. Patients were generally 
      undergoing erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment (82%), and the dosage 
      was to be kept constant during the trial. They were either switched from an 
      existing parenteral maintenance therapy (n=144) or were not currently being 
      treated with parenteral iron (n=38). Frequency of adverse events (AEs) and 
      changes in markers of iron deficiency anemia were measured during 8 weeks from 
      baseline. RESULTS: Nineteen treatment-related AEs occurred in 13 patients (7.1%) 
      and after 584 treatments (3.3%). No anaphylactic or delayed allergic reactions 
      were observed. There were no clinically significant changes in routine clinical 
      laboratory tests or vital signs. Hemoglobin increased from 99.2 g/L (SD=9.0) at 
      baseline to 111.2 g/L (SD=14.7) at week 8 in patients not currently treated with 
      parenteral iron (p<0.001) and increased slightly or stabilized in patients in 
      maintenance therapy. S-Ferritin, s-iron and transferrin saturation increased 
      significantly at all visits. CONCLUSIONS: Iron isomaltoside 1000 was clinically 
      well tolerated, safe and effective. This new intravenous iron may offer a further 
      valuable choice in treating the anemia of CKD.

TI  - Comparison of Methods Study between a Photonic Crystal Biosensor and Certified 
      ELISA to Measure Biomarkers of Iron Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Patients.
LID - 10.3390/s17102203 [doi]
LID - 2203
AB  - The total analytical error of a photonic crystal (PC) biosensor in the 
      determination of ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) as biomarkers 
      of iron deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients was evaluated 
      against certified ELISAs. Antigens were extracted from sera of CKD patients using 
      functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles (fAb-IONs) followed by magnetic 
      separation. Immuno-complexes were recognized by complementary detection Ab 
      affixed to the PC biosensor surface, and their signals were followed using the 
      BIND instrument. Quantification was conducted against actual protein standards. 
      Total calculated error (TEcalc) was estimated based on systematic (SE) and random 
      error (RE) and compared against total allowed error (TEa) based on established 
      quality specifications. Both detection platforms showed adequate linearity, 
      specificity, and sensitivity for biomarkers. Means, SD, and CV were similar 
      between biomarkers for both detection platforms. Compared to ELISA, inherent 
      imprecision was higher on the PC biosensor for ferritin, but not for sTfR. High 
      SE or RE in the PC biosensor when measuring either biomarker resulted in TEcalc 
      higher than the TEa. This did not influence the diagnostic ability of the PC 
      biosensor to discriminate CKD patients with low iron stores. The performance of 
      the PC biosensor is similar to certified ELISAs; however, optimization is 
      required to reduce TEcalc.

TI  - The FIND-CKD study--a randomized controlled trial of intravenous iron versus oral 
      iron in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients: background and rationale.
PG  - 843-50
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rigorous data are sparse concerning the optimal route of 
      administration and dosing strategy for iron therapy with or without concomitant 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy for the management of iron 
      deficiency anaemia in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease 
      (ND-CKD). METHODS: FIND-CKD was a 56-week, open-label, multicentre, prospective, 
      randomized three-arm study (NCT00994318) of 626 patients with ND-CKD and iron 
      deficiency anaemia randomized to (i) intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) 
      at an initial dose of 1000 mg iron with subsequent dosing as necessary to target 
      a serum ferritin level of 400-600 µg/L (ii) IV FCM at an initial dose of 200 mg 
      with subsequent dosing as necessary to target serum ferritin 100-200 µg/L or 
      (iii) oral ferrous sulphate 200 mg iron/day. The primary end point was time to 
      initiation of other anaemia management (ESA therapy, iron therapy other than 
      study drug or blood transfusion) or a haemoglobin (Hb) trigger (two consecutive 
      Hb values <10 g/dL without an increase of ≥ 0.5 g/dL). RESULTS: The background, 
      rationale and study design of the trial are presented here. The study has been 
      completed and results are expected in late 2013. DISCUSSION: FIND-CKD was the 
      longest randomized trial of IV iron therapy to date. Its findings will address 
      several unanswered questions regarding iron therapy to treat iron deficiency 
      anaemia in patients with ND-CKD. It was also the first randomized trial to 
      utilize both a high and low serum ferritin target range to adjust IV iron dosing, 
      and the first not to employ Hb response as its primary end point.

TI  - Prevalence and prognostic impact of anemia and iron deficiency in patients 
      hospitalized in an internal medicine ward: The PRO-IRON study.
PG  - 505-513
LID - 10.1111/ejh.12963 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess prevalence, predictive factors, and prognostic impact on 
      in-hospital mortality of anemia, iron deficiency anemia (IDA), iron deficiency 
      with or without anemia (ID), and iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) in 
      patients admitted to an internal medicine ward. METHODS: This 1-year prospective 
      study collected data on demographics, medical history, and blood tests in 771 
      consecutive patients on admission. RESULTS: Most patients were ≥65 years old 
      (80%) and had hypertension (63%), moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) (43%), 
      and heart failure (41%). Prevalence of anemia, IDA, ID, and IDWA was 67%, 41%, 
      58%, and 18%, respectively. Anemia was independently associated with age 
      ≥65 years (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15-2.70), active cancer (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.42-4.39), 
      and moderate CKD (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.12-2.43). ID was independently associated 
      with female gender (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.64-3.22), heart failure (OR 1.65, 95% CI 
      1.16-2.37), and moderate CKD (OR 2.95, 95% CI 2.04-4.30). Incidence of 
      in-hospital mortality was 21% and independently associated with anemia (RR 1.82, 
      95% CI 1.21-2.74). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia and iron deficiency were highly prevalent 
      in internal medicine patients. As anemia negatively impacts on in-hospital 
      mortality, awareness should be raised for effective diagnosis and management of 
      these comorbidities in hospitalized patients.

TI  - Comparison of intravenous iron sucrose versus low-molecular-weight iron dextran 
      in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 67-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1755-6686.2009.00099.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-molecular-weight iron dextran (CosmoFer) is the only form of 
      parenteral iron that can be administered as a total dose infusion (TDI) in the 
      United Kingdom (UK). This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TDI 
      CosmoFer in comparison to intravenous iron sucrose infusion (Venofer) in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study of 
      outpatients with CKD undergoing intravenous TDI CosmoFer or Venofer infusion was 
      conducted at Salford Royal Hospital and Sunderland Royal Hospital. A total of 979 
      doses of CosmoFer and 504 doses of Venofer were administered. There were three 
      minor adverse events in patients receiving CosmoFer compared with one minor event 
      in a Venofer treated patient. There were no anaphylactoid-type reactions in 
      either group. Serum haemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) 
      improved significantly 4-6 months postinfusion in both treatment groups. 
      CONCLUSION: TDI CosmoFer is an efficacious method of replenishing iron stores in 
      CKD patients in an outpatient setting. Furthermore, TDI CosmoFer is safe and not 
      associated with an increase in adverse events compared to Venofer.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of intravenous ferumoxytol for the treatment of iron 
      deficiency anemia in adult patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney 
      disease in the USA.
PG  - 557-567
LID - 10.2147/CEOR.S139950 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ferumoxytol has demonstrated superior efficacy compared with oral iron 
      in treating iron deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
      However, an economic evaluation of ferumoxytol has not been conducted. The aim of 
      this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of treating iron deficiency 
      anemia in adult non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with ferumoxytol as compared 
      with oral iron, alone or in combination with erythropoietin-stimulating agents 
      (ESAs). METHODS: A decision analytic model compared health outcomes and costs 
      associated with 5-week outpatient treatment of adult non-dialysis-dependent CKD 
      patients with ferumoxytol or oral iron, each as monotherapy or in combination 
      with ESAs in the USA. Direct costs include the following: drug acquisition and 
      administration, adverse events, and medical management. Efficacy was determined 
      as mean increase in hemoglobin (g/dL) from baseline over the 5-week period. 
      Clinical inputs were derived from patient-level data from two Phase III 
      randomized controlled trials of ferumoxytol vs. oral iron in 
      non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, and cost inputs from RED BOOK™ and Centers 
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
      identify cost drivers and assess the stability of results. RESULTS: The 5-week 
      treatment cost was $2,489, $5,216, $1,298, and $4,263 per patient for 
      ferumoxytol, ferumoxytol with ESAs, oral iron, and oral iron with ESAs, 
      respectively. The corresponding incremental costs per g/dL increase in 
      hemoglobin, relative to ferumoxytol alone, were $398, $3,558, and $4,768 per 
      patient. Efficacy was the main driver of cost-effectiveness for all treatments. 
      Adverse event and medical management costs were the principal drivers of oral 
      iron monotherapy costs, while drug acquisition substantially contributed to the 
      overall cost for the remaining treatments. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 
      ferumoxytol is a cost-effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia in 
      non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients over a 5-week period compared with oral iron 
      with or without ESAs. Ferumoxytol is more cost-effective as monotherapy.

TI  - Budget Impact Analysis of Oral Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) versus Intravenous Iron 
      for the Management of Iron Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease in Spain.
PG  - 801-811
LID - 10.1007/s40261-018-0666-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) that is associated with a decrease in the quality of life of patients and 
      an increase in the risk of other clinical complications. Iron therapy represents 
      one of the fundamentals of patients with CKD. Sucrosomial(®) oral iron allows 
      Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) to be used in all patients who are intolerant to 
      treatment by the oral route of administration, or who present with malabsorption 
      of conventional oral iron preparations. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this 
      study was to assess the economic impact of the oral iron Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) 
      for the management of iron deficiency in CKD patients in Spain. METHODS: A 4-year 
      budget impact model was developed for the period 2017-2020 for CKD patients with 
      iron deficiency who were candidates for intravenous iron due to a lack of 
      response to oral iron, from the perspective of the Spanish healthcare system. 
      Three subgroups of CKD patients were included in the analysis: predialysis, 
      peritoneal dialysis, and post-transplant. The intravenous iron formulations 
      Ferinject(®), Venofer(®), and Feriv(®) were considered appropriate comparators to 
      be used in the model. National data on the prevalence of CKD for the three 
      subgroups of patients were obtained from the literature, and input data on drug 
      utilization and outpatient hospitalizations associated with iron administration 
      were obtained by consulting nephrologists. Nephrology experts were also asked 
      about resources used during medical visits and monitoring tests. Based on the 
      unit costs for each iron therapy and the resources used, the total treatment cost 
      per patient associated with each product was obtained to estimate the global 
      budget impact of increasing the use of Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®). RESULTS: The 
      average annual budget savings due to an increase in Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) and a 
      decrease in intravenous iron have been estimated at €398,685, €180,937, and 
      €195,842 over 4 years for the predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and 
      post-transplant groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the use of 
      Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) leads to overall budget savings of €775,464 for the 
      Spanish National Health Service over 4 years.

TI  - Effect of atorvastatin on iron metabolism regulation in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease - a randomized double blind crossover study.
PG  - 700-709
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1535983 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To determine the effect of 6-month administration of atorvastatin 
      on hepcidin and hemojuvelin levels, inflammatory parameters and iron metabolism 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4. METHODS: Thirty six 
      statin- and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-naive patients with CKD stages 3 and 
      4 and LDL cholesterol ≥100 mg/dl received atorvastatin or placebo for two 6-month 
      periods in a double blind, randomized crossover study. Hepcidin, hemojuvelin, 
      hsCRP, IL-6, hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, iron, total iron 
      binding capacity (TIBC), and unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) were 
      measured before and after each treatment period. RESULTS: Hepcidin decreased 
      (from 102 [307] to 63 [170] pg/ml (p > .001)) in the course of statin therapy but 
      remained unchanged after placebo administration (173 [256] to 153 [204] pg/ml, 
      respectively). Hemojuvelin did not change after either part of the study. Both 
      IL-6 and hsCRP decreased following statin therapy (from 8.7 [12.0] to 8.1 [13.9] 
      pg/ml; p = .04 and from 4.7 [4.0] to 4.0 [3.6] mg/l; p = .4, respectively), but 
      did not change after placebo administration. Blood hemoglobin increased slightly 
      but significantly after 6-month statin therapy (from 11.6 ± 1.6 to 
      11.9 ± 1.5 g/dl, p = .002), and was unchanged after placebo treatment. TIBC and 
      UIBC increased significantly after 6-month statin therapy, and serum iron also 
      tended to increase. The change of eGFR during the study did not differ between 
      the two treatment periods. CONCLUSIONS: Statin may have a small but potentially 
      beneficial effect on serum hepcidin, which may lead to improvement of anemia 
      control in CKD patients.

TI  - Dietary iron restriction alleviates renal tubulointerstitial injury induced by 
      protein overload in mice.
PG  - 10621

LID - 10621
AB  - Increased proteinuria causes tubulointerstitial injury due to inflammation in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron restriction exhibits protective effects 
      against renal dysfunction; however, its effects against protein overload-induced 
      tubulointerstitial damage remain unclear. Here, we investigated dietary iron 
      restriction effect on tubulointerstitial damage in mice with protein-overload 
      tubulointerstitial injury. Renal tubulointerstitial injury in animal model was 
      induced by intraperitoneal injection of an overdose of bovine serum albumin 
      (BSA). We divided mice into three groups: normal saline + normal diet (ND), 
      BSA + ND, and BSA + iron-restricted diet (IRD). BSA overload induced renal 
      tubulointerstitial injury in the ND mice, which was ameliorated in the IRD mice. 
      Inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix mRNA expression was upregulated 
      in BSA + ND mice kidneys and was inhibited by IRD. BSA-induced increase in renal 
      superoxide production, NADPH oxidase activity, and p22(phox) expression was 
      diminished in the IRD mice. IRD suppression increased BSA-induced renal 
      macrophage infiltration. Moreover, BSA mice exhibited nucleotide-binding 
      oligomerisation domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein (NLRP) 
      inflammasome activation, which was inhibited by IRD. Ferrous iron increased in 
      kidneys with BSA overload and was inhibited by IRD. Thus, iron restriction 
      inhibited oxidative stress and inflammatory changes, contributing to the 
      protective effect against BSA overload-induced tubulointerstitial injury.

TI  - A randomized trial of iron isomaltoside 1000 versus oral iron in 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients with anaemia.
PG  - 646-55
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv293 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anaemia is common in patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) and is often treated with 
      oral or intravenous (IV) iron therapy. This trial compared the efficacy and 
      safety of IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) and oral iron in NDD-CKD patients 
      with renal-related anaemia. METHODS: The trial was a Phase III open-label, 
      comparative, multicentre, non-inferiority trial conducted in 351 iron-deficient 
      NDD-CKD patients, randomized 2:1 to either iron isomaltoside 1000 (Group A) or 
      iron sulphate administered as 100 mg elemental oral iron twice daily (200 mg 
      daily) for 8 weeks (Group B). The patients in Group A were randomized into A1 
      (infusion of max. 1000 mg single doses over 15 min) and A2 (bolus injections of 
      500 mg over 2 min). A modified Ganzoni formula was used to calculate IV iron 
      need. The primary end point was change in haemoglobin concentrations from 
      baseline to Week 4. RESULTS: Iron isomaltoside 1000 was both non-inferior to oral 
      iron at Week 4 (P < 0.001) and sustained a superior increase in haemoglobin from 
      Week 3 until the end of the study at Week 8 (P = 0.009 at Week 3). The 
      haemoglobin response was more pronounced with iron isomaltoside 1000 doses ≥1000 
      mg (P < 0.05). Serum-ferritin and transferrin saturation concentrations were also 
      significantly increased with IV iron. Adverse drug reactions were observed in 
      10.5% in the iron isomaltoside 1000 group and 10.3% in the oral iron group. More 
      patients treated with oral iron sulphate withdrew from the study due to adverse 
      events (4.3 versus 0.9%, P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Iron isomaltoside 1000 was more 
      efficacious than oral iron for increase in haemoglobin and proved to be well 
      tolerated at the tested dose levels in NDD-CKD patients.

TI  - Factors Governing the Erythropoietic Response to Intravenous Iron Infusion in 
      Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11092417 [doi]
LID - 2417
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists about factors affecting parenteral iron 
      response. A study was conducted to determine the factors influencing the 
      erythropoietic response to parenteral iron in iron-deficient anaemic patients 
      whose kidney function ranged from normal through all stages of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) severity. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 
      parenteral iron recipients who did not receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents 
      (ESA) between 2017 and 2019. The study cohort was derived from two groups of 
      patients: those managed by the CKD team and patients being optimised for surgery 
      in the pre-operative clinic. Patients were categorized based on their kidney 
      function: Patients with normal kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)] were compared to those with CKD stages 3-5 
      (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Patients were further stratified by the type of 
      iron deficiency [absolute iron deficiency (AID) versus functional iron deficiency 
      (FID)]. The key outcome was change in hemoglobin (∆Hb) between pre- and 
      post-infusion haemoglobin (Hb) values. Parenteral iron response was assessed 
      using propensity-score matching and multivariate linear regression. The impact of 
      kidney impairment versus the nature of iron deficiency (AID vs. FID) in response 
      was explored. RESULTS: 732 subjects (mean age 66 ± 17 years, 56% females and 87% 
      White) were evaluated. No significant differences were observed in the time to 
      repeat Hb among CKD stages and FID/AID patients. The Hb rise was significantly 
      lower with lower kidney function (non-CKD and CKD1-2; 13 g/L, CKD3-5; 7 g/L; p < 
      0.001). When groups with different degrees of renal impairment were 
      propensity-score matched according to whether iron deficiency was due to AID or 
      FID, the level of CKD was found not to be relevant to Hb responses [unmatched 
      (∆Hb) 12.1 vs. 8.7 g/L; matched (∆Hb) 12.4 vs. 12.1 g/L in non-CKD and CKD1-2 
      versus CKD3-5, respectively]. However, a comparison of patients with AID and FID, 
      while controlling for the degree of CKD, indicated that patients with FID 
      exhibited a diminished Hb response regardless of their level of kidney 
      impairment. CONCLUSION: The nature of iron deficiency rather than the severity of 
      CKD has a stronger impact on Hb response to intravenous iron with an attenuated 
      response seen in functional iron deficiency irrespective of the degree of renal 
      impairment.

TI  - A Randomized Trial of Intravenous Iron Supplementation and Exercise on Exercise 
      Capacity in Iron-Deficient Nonanemic Patients With CKD.
PG  - 1496-1505
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2023.05.002 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often iron 
      deficient, even when not anemic. This trial evaluated whether iron 
      supplementation enhances exercise capacity of nonanemic patients with CKD who 
      have iron-deficiency. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter double-blind randomized 
      controlled trial of nondialysis patients with CKD and iron-deficiency but without 
      anemia (Hemoglobin [Hb] >110 g/l). Patients were assigned 1:1 to intravenous (IV) 
      iron therapy, or placebo. An 8-week exercise program commenced at week 4. The 
      primary outcome was the mean between-group difference in 6-minute walk test 
      (6MWT) at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes included 6MWT at 12 weeks, transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin (SF), Hb, renal function, muscle strength, 
      functional capacity, quality of life, and adverse events at baseline, 4 weeks, 
      and at 12 weeks. Mean between-group differences were analyzed using analysis of 
      covariance models. RESULTS: Among 75 randomized patients, mean (SD) age for iron 
      therapy (n = 37) versus placebo (n = 38) was 54 (16) versus 61 (12) years; 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (34 [12] vs. 35 [11] ml/min per 1.73 
      m(2)], TSAT (23 [12] vs. 21 [6])%; SF (57 [64] vs. 62 [33]) μg/l; Hb (122.4 [9.2] 
      vs. 127 [13.2] g/l); 6MWT (384 [95] vs. 469 [142] meters) at baseline, 
      respectively. No significant mean between-group difference was observed in 6MWT 
      distance at 4 weeks. There were significant increases in SF and TSAT at 4 and 12 
      weeks (P < 0.02), and Hb at 12 weeks (P = 0.009). There were no between-group 
      differences in other secondary outcomes and no adverse events attributable to 
      iron therapy. CONCLUSION: This trial did not demonstrate beneficial effects of IV 
      iron therapy on exercise capacity at 4 weeks. A larger study is needed to confirm 
      if IV iron is beneficial in nondialysis patients with CKD who are iron-deficient.

TI  - Association of markers of iron stores with outcomes in patients with 
      nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 435-41
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03980808 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Assessments of iron stores by serum iron saturation 
      ratio (ISAT) and ferritin are used to direct anemia therapy in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and are associated with clinical outcomes in patients on dialysis. 
      The association of ISAT and ferritin with outcomes in patients with 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) has not been studied. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All-cause mortality and progression of CKD [slopes 
      of estimated GFR (eGFR)] were examined in 453 men with NDD-CKD. Mortality and the 
      composite of mortality and ESRD were studied in Cox models. Slopes of eGFR were 
      examined in mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Lower ISAT was associated with higher 
      mortality; adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] with ISAT of 
      <12%, 13 to 17%, and >23% versus 18 to 23%; 1.40 (0.99 to 1.98), 1.20 (0.82 to 
      1.76), and 0.97 (0.67 to 1.41), P = 0.025 for trend. ISAT was also associated 
      with steeper slopes of eGFR (one log-unit higher ISAT associated with a slope of 
      -0.89 ml/min/1.73 m(2) /yr (95% CI: -1.75, -0.02, P = 0.044). Serum ferritin 
      level showed no significant association with outcomes overall, but a trend for 
      higher mortality was observed in patients with a serum ferritin level >250 ng/ml. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher ISAT is associated with lower mortality and with more 
      progressive CKD. Clinical trials are needed to examine if correction of low iron 
      levels can improve mortality without affecting kidney function in NDD-CKD.

TI  - Effect of cross-linked chitosan iron (III) on vascular calcification in uremic 
      rats.
PG  - 796-802
LID - 10.1177/1535370218775035 [doi]
AB  - Cross-linked chitosan iron (III) is a chitin-derived polymer with a chelating 
      effect on phosphorus, but it is untested in vascular calcification. We evaluated 
      this compound's ability to reduce hyperphosphatemia and its effect on vascular 
      calcification in uremic rats using an adenine-based, phosphorus-rich diet for 
      seven weeks. We used a control group to characterize the uremia. Uremic rats were 
      divided according the treatment into chronic kidney disease, CKD-Ch-Fe(III)CL 
      (CKD-Ch), CKD-calcium carbonate, or CKD-sevelamer groups. We measured creatinine, 
      phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus excretion fraction, 
      parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23. Vascular calcification was 
      assessed using the aortic calcium content, and a semi-quantitative analysis was 
      performed using Von Kossa and hematoxylin-eosin staining. At week seven, rats in 
      the chronic kidney disease group had higher creatinine, phosphorus, phosphorus 
      excretion fraction, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, fibroblast growth factor 23, 
      and aortic calcium content than those in the Control group. Treatments with 
      cross-linked chitosan iron (III) and calcium carbonate prevented phosphorus 
      increase (20%-30% reduction). The aortic calcium content was lowered by 88% and 
      85% in the CKD-Ch and CKD-sevelamer groups, respectively. The prevalence of 
      vascular changes was higher in the chronic kidney disease and CKD-calcium 
      carbonate (62.5%) groups than in the CKD-Ch group (37.5%). In conclusion, 
      cross-linked chitosan iron (III) had a phosphorus chelating effect similar to 
      calcium carbonate already available for clinical use, and prevented calcium 
      accumulation in the aorta. Impact statement Vascular calcification (VC) is a 
      common complication due to CKD-related bone and mineral disorder (BMD) and is 
      characterized by deposition of calcium in vessels. Effective therapies are not 
      yet available but new phosphorus chelators can prevent complications from CV. We 
      tested the effect of chitosan, a new phosphorus chelator, on the VC of uremic 
      animals. It has recently been proposed that chitosan treatment may be effective 
      in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia. However, its action on vascular 
      calcification has not been investigated yet. In this study, we demonstrated that 
      chitosan reduced the calcium content in the aorta, suggesting that this may be a 
      therapeutic approach in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia by preventing CV.

TI  - The Ferumoxytol for Anemia of CKD Trial (FACT)-a randomized controlled trial of 
      repeated doses of ferumoxytol or iron sucrose in patients on hemodialysis: 
      background and rationale.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.1186/s12882-017-0523-8 [doi]
LID - 117
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common manifestation of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), affecting most patients on hemodialysis and imposing a 
      substantial clinical burden. Treatment with iron supplementation increases 
      hemoglobin levels and can reduce the severity of anemia in patients with CKD. 
      While correcting anemia in these patients is an important therapeutic goal, there 
      is a lack of long-term trials directly comparing intravenous iron therapies in 
      patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis. METHODS/DESIGN: The Ferumoxytol for 
      Anemia of CKD Trial (FACT) is a 13-month, open-label, randomized, multicenter, 
      international, prospective study with 2 substudies. Entry criteria for the main 
      study include adults with IDA (defined as hemoglobin <11.5 g/dL [<115.0 g/L] and 
      a transferrin saturation <30%), serum ferritin <800 ng/mL (<1798 pmol/L), and 
      receiving hemodialysis for ≥3 months. Patients are randomized to receive 
      ferumoxytol (1.02 g over 2 doses) or iron sucrose (1.0 g over 10 doses) during 
      the initial 5-week treatment period. Those with persistent/recurrent IDA over the 
      11-month observation period will receive additional 5-week treatment periods, as 
      appropriate. The primary efficacy endpoint of the main study is the mean change 
      in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 for each treatment period. The secondary 
      efficacy endpoints include the mean change in transferrin saturation from 
      Baseline to Week 5 and the proportion of patients with a hemoglobin increase of 
      ≥1.0 g/dL at any time from Baseline to Week 5. Safety will be assessed through an 
      examination of the adverse event profile over the course of the study. An 
      "oxidative stress" substudy in approximately 100 patients will assess the effects 
      of treatment on biomarkers of oxidative stress/inflammation during the initial 
      5-week treatment period, and a magnetic resonance imaging substudy in 
      approximately 70 patients will assess the potential for iron deposition in target 
      tissues over 24 months. DISCUSSION: FACT fulfills the need for a long-term 
      comparative trial in patients with IDA and CKD receiving hemodialysis. The 
      efficacy and safety results will provide useful information for guiding therapy 
      in this population. Two hundred ninety-six patients have been enrolled, and 
      completion of the main study is expected soon. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01227616 (registered October 22, 2010); EudraCT 
      number: 2010-022133-28.

TI  - Iron sucrose accelerates early atherogenesis by increasing superoxide production 
      and upregulating adhesion molecules in CKD.
PG  - 2596-606
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2013080838 [doi]
AB  - High-dose intravenous iron supplementation is associated with adverse 
      cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD, but the underlying mechanism is 
      unknown. Our study investigated the causative role of iron sucrose in 
      leukocyte-endothelium interactions, an index of early atherogenesis, and 
      subsequent atherosclerosis in the mouse remnant kidney model. We found that 
      expression levels of intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular 
      cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and adhesion of U937 cells increased in 
      iron-treated human aortic endothelial cells through upregulated NADPH oxidase 
      (NOx) and NF-κB signaling. We then measured mononuclear-endothelial adhesion and 
      atherosclerotic lesions of the proximal aorta in male C57BL/6 mice with subtotal 
      nephrectomy, male apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice with 
      uninephrectomy, and sham-operated mice subjected to saline or parenteral iron 
      loading. Iron sucrose significantly increased tissue superoxide production, 
      expression of tissue cell adhesion molecules, and endothelial adhesiveness in 
      mice with subtotal nephrectomy. Moreover, iron sucrose exacerbated 
      atherosclerosis in the aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice with uninephrectomy. In patients 
      with CKD, intravenous iron sucrose increased circulating mononuclear superoxide 
      production, expression of soluble adhesion molecules, and mononuclear-endothelial 
      adhesion compared with healthy subjects or untreated patients. In summary, iron 
      sucrose aggravated endothelial dysfunction through NOx/NF-κB/CAM signaling, 
      increased mononuclear-endothelial adhesion, and exacerbated atherosclerosis in 
      mice with remnant kidneys. These results suggest a novel causative role for 
      therapeutic iron in cardiovascular complications in patients with CKD.

TI  - Intravenous iron therapy in chronic kidney disease and peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 571-6, 584
AB  - Identical National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
      (K/DOQI) hematologic and iron targets apply to chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD), and hemodialysis (HD) patients, yet intravenous (i.v.) 
      nondextran iron therapy is FDA approved only in HD patients. This is because oral 
      iron has been considered adequate in CKD and PD patients, and delivering a 
      parenteral therapy on a frequent basis to an outpatient population with 
      notoriously poor vascular access presents logistical complexities. However, 
      recognition of the need for more aggressive treatment of anemia in the CKD and PD 
      population is growing. This awareness, along with the improved safety profiles of 
      the new, nondextran irons, is tipping the risk-benefit ratio toward more 
      widespread use of i.v. iron in these patients. This article provides a summary of 
      the literature and of our own experience using i.v. iron therapy in CKD and PD 
      patients. Our protocol relies on early monitoring and intervention with i.v. 
      ferric gluconate before severe iron deficiency develops. The proactive approach 
      allows for relatively infrequent treatments at only moderately "high" doses (250 
      mg) of ferric gluconate. The convergence of convenience and safety may expedite 
      more energetic anemia prevention and treatment in PD and CKD patients.

TI  - Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia in chronic kidney disease and can 
      often be corrected with intravenous iron.
PG  - 161-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is some epidemiological and clinical evidence that the anemia 
      seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients not on dialysis could be due to 
      a significant extent to iron deficiency, and that adequate iron replacement could 
      cause a marked improvement in the anemia even without the use of erythropoietin 
      (EPO). The purpose of this work was to study the effects of intravenous (i.v.) 
      iron administration (ferric gluconate - Ferrlecit) on hemoglobin (Hb) of patients 
      with CKD. METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients with CKD with Hb <12 g/dL in 
      whom no underlying cause for the anemia could be found underwent sternal bone 
      marrow biopsy and had their red cell and blood iron parameters measured. They 
      then received 250 mg of ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) intravenously twice monthly 
      for 3 months, and had their blood parameters measured 1 month later. No patient 
      received erythropoietin (EPO). RESULTS: Forty-six patients had no evidence of any 
      iron deposits in the bone marrow - consistent with the presence of severe iron 
      deficiency. The mean serum ferritin and %transferrin saturation prior to 
      treatment were 235.9 +/- 54.3 ug/L and 13.5 +/- 4.1%, respectively, and both 
      increased significantly with the iron treatment. Mean Hb increased from 10.16 +/- 
      1.32 to 11.96 +/- 1.52 g/dL, an increase of 1.80 +/- 1.72 g/dL (p<0.01). 
      Twenty-six patients (55.3%) reached the target Hb of 12 g/dL. Ten patients 
      (21.3%) had an increase of 0.1-0.9 g/dL, nine patients (19.1%) had an increase of 
      1-1.9 g/dL and 23 patients (48.9%) had an increase of >or= 2 g/dL. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Iron deficiency is frequently seen in anemic CKD patients not on dialysis and its 
      correction with i.v. iron will often cause a marked increase in the Hb level, and 
      the achievement of the target Hb of 12 g/dL even without EPO.

TI  - A randomized comparison of ferumoxytol and iron sucrose for treating iron 
      deficiency anemia in patients with CKD.
PG  - 705-12
LID - 10.2215/CJN.05320513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Few randomized controlled trials have compared 
      intravenous iron products head to head in CKD patients with iron deficiency 
      anemia. This study compared the efficacy and safety of two intravenous iron 
      products (ferumoxytol [Feraheme injection] and iron sucrose [Venofer]) in 
      patients with CKD and iron deficiency anemia. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: In this phase II, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, 
      multicenter clinical trial, patients were randomized 1:1 to either 1.02 g 
      ferumoxytol (2 × 510-mg injections) or 1.0 g iron sucrose administered as either 
      a slow injection or infusion (10 doses for dialysis patients and 5 doses for 
      nondialysis patients). Inclusion criteria included hemoglobin<11.0 g/dl, 
      transferrin saturation<30%, and eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a diagnosis of 
      underlying CKD (e.g., nephropathy or nephritis). The primary end point was change 
      in hemoglobin from baseline to week 5. RESULTS: In total, 162 patients were 
      randomized. Demographics were balanced between the treatment groups. Adverse 
      event profiles of the two regimens were fairly similar: overall adverse events, 
      48% ferumoxytol versus 65% iron sucrose; related adverse events, 10% ferumoxytol 
      versus 16% iron sucrose; and adverse events leading to study discontinuation, 1% 
      ferumoxytol versus 5% iron sucrose. Rates of serious adverse events and related 
      serious adverse events were similar between the ferumoxytol and iron sucrose 
      groups: serious adverse events, 9% versus 7%, respectively and related serious 
      adverse events, 1% versus 1%, respectively. Overall, increases in hemoglobin were 
      similar between treatment groups. Based on an ANOVA model adjusted for baseline 
      hemoglobin level and dialysis status, the least squares mean change from baseline 
      to week 5 was 0.8 ± 0.1 g/dl in the ferumoxytol-treated group and 0.7 ± 0.1 g/dl 
      in the iron sucrose group. The difference in the mean change from baseline 
      between the two treatment groups was 0.1 g/dl (95% confidence interval, -0.2 to 
      0.4). CONCLUSION: In this randomized, controlled trial, ferumoxytol and iron 
      sucrose showed comparable efficacy and adverse events rates.

PG  - 106-10

AB  - The role of intravenous iron in contributing to oxidative stress and endothelial 
      dysfunction in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is debatable. The present study 
      assessed differences in fasting plasma malondialdehyde (pMDA) levels 30 minutes 
      before and after intravenous infusion of low molecular weight iron dextran (ID) 
      (n = 19), iron-sucrose (IS) (n = 20), and sodium ferrigluconate complex (SFGC) (n 
      = 20) in stage 3 and 4 CKD patients. Post-infusion pMDA levels were significantly 
      raised with respect to baseline (p < 0.001). pMDA was significantly higher in the 
      SFGC group vs. IS (3.02 +/- 0.84 micromol/L vs. 2.82 +/- 0.44 micromol/L, p = 
      0.034) or SFGC vs. ID (3.02 +/- 0.84 micromol/L vs. 2.92 +/- 0.20 micromol/L, p = 
      0.048). There was no difference between IS vs. ID (2.82 +/- 0.44 micromol/L vs. 
      2.92 +/- 0.20 micromol/L, p = 0.21). To conclude, all forms of parenteral iron, 
      especially SFGC, significantly raise pMDA levels in the immediate 
      post-transfusion period.

TI  - Iron sucrose causes greater proteinuria than ferric gluconate in non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 638-42
AB  - Non-dextran intravenous (i.v.) iron preparations seem to differentially affect 
      proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease. To study effects of ferric 
      gluconate and iron sucrose on proteinuria, we conducted a crossover trial in 12 
      patients with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease. These patients were randomized to 
      receive the same dose of either drug 1 week apart. Urine samples were obtained 
      immediately before and at frequent intervals after the drug. The urine total 
      protein/creatinine ratio was significantly greater after iron sucrose than ferric 
      gluconate treatment with the effect noted within 15 min post-infusion. 
      Furthermore, when iron sucrose was given first, a significantly greater 
      protein/creatinine ratio was seen subsequently with ferric gluconate than with 
      the reverse order of treatment. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio was also 
      significantly greater with iron sucrose than with ferric gluconate. There was no 
      significant difference, however, between the two i.v. irons in the measured urine 
      N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase/creatinine ratio. Although our study showed that 
      acutely, iron sucrose increased proteinuria, the long-term effects of repeated 
      i.v. non-dextran iron on kidney function requires further study.

TI  - The safety and efficacy of an accelerated iron sucrose dosing regimen in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - S72-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Provision of adequate iron to support erythropoiesis in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) is time consuming and may present adherence problems 
      for patients in the outpatient setting. We studied an accelerated regimen of 
      high-dose intravenous iron sucrose therapy in a cohort of iron-deficient, anemic 
      CKD patients. METHODS: Intravenous iron sucrose 500 mg was infused over three 
      hours on two consecutive days in 107 CKD patients (glomerular filtration rate, 
      32.3 +/- 19.6 mL/min/1.73m2, baseline hemoglobin 10.2 +/- 1.7 g/dL). Iron indices 
      (transferrin saturation, ferritin) were measured at baseline and at two and seven 
      days after completion of the iron regimen. Blood pressures were monitored 
      immediately prior to, and hourly throughout the iron sucrose infusions. RESULTS: 
      Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin increased from 18.5 +/- 8.5% and 177 
      +/- 123.8 ng/mL at baseline to 40.2 +/- 22.3% and 811 +/- 294.1 ng/mL in 102 
      evaluated patients (P < 0.015). In 55 patients with additional measurements at 7 
      days post-dosing, the transferrin saturation and ferritin had fallen to 26.3 +/- 
      10.6% and 691 +/- 261.8 ng/mL (P < 0.015 compared to two days' post-dose). Blood 
      pressure rose slightly, but not significantly, throughout the infusions, and 
      altering the infusion rate was not necessary. Two patients had seven adverse 
      events that were considered related to iron sucrose. CONCLUSION: An accelerated 
      regimen of high-dose intravenous iron sucrose therapy in CKD patients is safe and 
      effective in restoring iron stores, and may potentially save time and improve 
      patient adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High phosphate-induced vascular calcification (VC) and iron 
      deficiency-induced anemia are two major contributors of cardiovascular morbidity 
      and mortality in patients affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since 
      phosphate (Pi) control and iron replacement are common therapies in CKD, the aim 
      of our study was to investigate the effect of iron on high Pi-induced VC in rat 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). METHODS: We treated VSMCs with 5 mM Pi and 
      iron citrate (Fe(3+)) to evaluate Ca deposition by Alizarin Red destaining, DNA 
      fragmentation by ELISA, gene expression by RT-PCR and protein expression by 
      Western blot. RESULTS: Pretreatment with Fe(3+) prevents high Pi-induced calcium 
      (Ca) deposition concentration-dependently, with 90.1% inhibition at 50 μM 
      (0.716 ± 0.04 vs. 0.071 ± 0.01, OD/mg protein; Pi vs. Pi + Fe(3+), p < 0.01). We 
      found that 50 μM Fe(3+) completely prevents high Pi-induced apoptosis measured as 
      DNA fragmentation (1.51 ± 0.08 vs. 1.03 ± 0.06, Pi vs. Pi + Fe(3+); p < 0.01), 
      through the prevention of the downregulation of the pro-survival pathway 
      GAS6/AXL. Moreover, Fe(3+) stimulates autophagy, a protective phenomenon in VC, 
      as demonstrated by electron microscopy and by autophagy flux detected by LC3IIβ 
      protein expression. Finally, high Pi-induced osteoblastic differentiation is 
      partially affected by Fe(3+), since BMP2 increase is prevented and OPN is 
      enhanced, but RUNX2 increase and α-actin and SM22α decrease are not modified. 
      Interestingly, the addition of Fe(3+) at different time points after Pi challenge 
      completely blocks the progression of Ca deposition. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 
      iron citrate inhibits high Pi-induced Ca deposition by prevention of apoptosis, 
      induction of autophagy, and partially affecting osteoblastic differentiation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency is common and associated with worse outcomes in 
      patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease. We performed a national, 
      multicentre, observational and transversal study to assess the prevalence of iron 
      deficiency as well as current iron deficiency screening practices in this 
      population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 25 nephrology centres in France 
      participated in the study. All adult non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients 
      who met the inclusion (GFR>15mL/min/1.73m(2)) and exclusion criteria and provided 
      consent were systematically recruited over a 4-week inclusion period. 
      Investigators were asked to perform a blood test (hemoglobin concentration, serum 
      iron, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation) and to complete a questionnaire 
      about their iron status monitoring practices. The primary objective was to assess 
      the prevalence of iron deficiency (serum ferritin<100μg/L and/or transferrin 
      saturation<20%). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the prevalence of absolute 
      iron deficiency (serum ferritin<100μg/L and transferrin saturation<20%) and 
      functional iron deficiency (serum ferritin≥100μg/L and transferrin 
      saturation<20%), the prevalence of iron deficiency according to haemoglobin 
      concentration and chronic kidney disease stage, the proportion of centres that 
      perform routine evaluation of iron status and the number of patients receiving 
      iron supplementation. RESULTS: A total of 1211 patients with non-dialysis chronic 
      kidney disease were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of iron 
      deficiency was 47.1%. The rates of absolute iron deficiency and functional iron 
      deficiency and anaemia were 13.4% and 17.1%, respectively. Among the 
      25 participating centres, 12 reported routine assessment of iron status in 
      non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. CONCLUSION: In this observational 
      study, a high prevalence of iron deficiency was observed among non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease patients. Less than half of participating centres reported 
      routine assessment of iron status.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) for treatment of iron 
      deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease and in kidney transplant 
      recipients.
PG  - 125-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney disease and 
      in kidney transplant recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the safety and 
      tolerability of the new intravenous iron preparation ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) 
      in these two patient groups. Adverse events after administration of the drug were 
      assessed by using a questionnaire. Vital signs and laboratory data were collected 
      before and after the application of FCM. A total of 46 FCM doses were applied to 
      44 patients (17 with chronic kidney disease and 27 kidney transplant recipients) 
      either as single injection of 100 or 200 mg (n = 42) or as short infusion with up 
      to 500 mg (n = 4). RESULTS: Mild and transient adverse events (metallic taste, 
      headache, dizziness) occurred in six patients. The estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate remained unchanged by the FCM administration. CONCLUSION: We 
      conclude that safety and tolerability of FCM were excellent. Compared with other 
      intravenous iron preparations the considerably shorter administration time of FCM 
      allows to save time and to reduce costs.

TI  - Switching patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease from oral iron to 
      intravenous ferric carboxymaltose: effects on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent 
      requirements, costs, hemoglobin and iron status.
PG  - e0125528

LID - e0125528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) 
      often receive an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and oral iron treatment. 
      This study evaluated whether a switch from oral iron to intravenous ferric 
      carboxymaltose can reduce ESA requirements and improve iron status and hemoglobin 
      in patients with ND-CKD. METHODS: This prospective, single arm and single-center 
      study included adult patients with ND-CKD (creatinine clearance ≤40 mL/min), 
      hemoglobin 11-12 g/dL and iron deficiency (ferritin <100 μg/L or transferrin 
      saturation <20%), who were regularly treated with oral iron and ESA during 6 
      months prior to inclusion. Study patients received an intravenous ferric 
      carboxymaltose dose of 1,000 mg iron, followed by a 6-months ESA/ ferric 
      carboxymaltose maintenance regimen (target: hemoglobin 12 g/dL, transferrin 
      saturation >20%). Outcome measures were ESA dose requirements during the 
      observation period after initial ferric carboxymaltose treatment (primary 
      endpoint); number of hospitalizations and transfusions, renal function before and 
      after ferric carboxymaltose administration, number of adverse reactions 
      (secondary endpoints). Hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin and 
      transferrin saturation were measured monthly from baseline until end of study. 
      Creatinine clearance, proteinuria, C-reactive protein, aspartate 
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase bimonthly 
      from baseline until end of study. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled (age 
      70.1±11.4 years; mean±SD). Mean ESA consumption was significantly reduced by 
      83.2±10.9% (from 41,839±3,668 IU/patient to 6,879±4,271 IU/patient; p<0.01). 
      Hemoglobin increased by 0.7±0.3 g/dL, ferritin by 196.0±38.7 μg/L and transferrin 
      saturation by 5.3±2.9% (month 6 vs. baseline; all p<0.01). No ferric 
      carboxymaltose-related adverse events were reported and no patient withdrew or 
      required transfusions during the study. CONCLUSION: Among patients with ND-CKD 
      and stable normal or borderline hemoglobin, switching from oral iron to 
      intravenous ferric carboxymaltose was associated with significant improvements in 
      hematological and iron parameters and a significant reduction in ESA dose

TI  - Iron uptake and ferrokinetics in healthy male subjects of an iron-based oral 
      phosphate binder (SBR759) labeled with the stable isotope (58)Fe.
PG  - 2062-71
LID - 10.1039/c4mt00126e [doi]
AB  - SBR759 is a novel polynuclear iron(III) oxide-hydroxide starch·sucrose·carbonate 
      complex being developed for oral use in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 
      with hyperphosphatemia on hemodialysis. SBR759 binds inorganic phosphate released 
      by food uptake and digestion in the gastro-intestinal tract increasing the fecal 
      excretion of phosphate with concomitant reduction of serum phosphate 
      concentrations. Considering the high content of ∼20% w/w covalently bound iron in 
      SBR759 and expected chronic administration to patients, absorption of small 
      amounts of iron released from the drug substance could result in potential iron 
      overload and toxicity. In a mechanistic iron uptake study, 12 healthy male 
      subjects (receiving comparable low phosphorus-containing meal typical for CKD 
      patients: ≤1000 mg phosphate per day) were treated with 12 g (divided in 3 × 4 g) 
      of stable (58)Fe isotope-labeled SBR759. The ferrokinetics of 
      [(58)Fe]SBR759-related total iron was followed in blood (over 3 weeks) and in 
      plasma (over 26 hours) by analyzing with high precision the isotope ratios of the 
      natural iron isotopes (58)Fe, (57)Fe, (56)Fe and (54)Fe by multi-collector 
      inductively coupled mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Three weeks following dosing, 
      the subjects cumulatively absorbed on average 7.8 ± 3.2 mg (3.8-13.9 mg) iron 
      corresponding to 0.30 ± 0.12% (0.15-0.54%) SBR759-related iron which amounts to 
      approx. 5-fold the basal daily iron absorption of 1-2 mg in humans. SBR759 was 
      well-tolerated and there was no serious adverse event and no clinically 
      significant changes in the iron indices hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin 
      concentration and transferrin saturation.

PG  - 96-100
LID - 10.4103/0971-4065.57105 [doi]
AB  - Anemia in patients with chronic renal failure is multifactorial with an absolute 
      or functional iron deficiency present in 60-80% of patients. In this study, 102 
      patients of stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) were enrolled. Thirty six age- 
      and sex-matched anemic patients without any known renal disease were taken as 
      controls. Their sTfR levels were measured with anemia profile.(Fe, TIBC, 
      Ferritin, TSAT). The patients were followed up twice, at four weeks and six 
      months. There was a significant statistical difference in the mean sTfR levels in 
      patients when compared to controls (P < 0.01).The mean level of sTfR in CKD 
      patients was 3.23 +/- 2.07 mg/l while in controls this was 5.16 +/- 3.64 mg/l. 
      sTfR had no statistically significant correlation with the levels of hemoglobin, 
      iron, ferritin, TIBC and TSAT. We conclude that owing to complexity of iron 
      metabolism in CKD, sTfR can not be used as a reliable marker of iron deficiency 
      anemia.

TI  - Iron supplementation associates with low mortality in pre-dialyzed advanced 
      chronic kidney disease patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: a 
      nationwide database analysis.
PG  - 1518-25
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A risk/benefit analysis of iron supplementation in pre-dialysis 
      advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has not been conducted. We aim to 
      assess the effectiveness and the safety of iron supplementation in patients with 
      CKD Stage 5 who have not yet received dialysis (CKD 5 ND). METHODS: A prospective 
      cohort study was conducted based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research 
      Database. From 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2009, we enrolled 31 971 adult patients 
      who had a serum creatinine >6 mg/dL and a haematocrit <28% and who were treated 
      with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). All patients were further divided 
      into two groups with or without iron supplementation within 90 days after 
      starting ESA therapy. Patient follow-up took place until dialysis, death before 
      initiation of dialysis or 31 December 2009. The primary outcomes were death 
      before initiating dialysis, hospitalization before death or long-term dialysis. 
      RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the patients who received iron 
      supplementation were associated with a lower risk of all-cause death [hazard 
      ratio (HR), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-0.90] compared with 
      non-users. The survival benefit of iron use was consistent across the majority of 
      dosage groups, except for those who were treated with monthly IV iron >200 mg. 
      Moreover, compared with the non-users, the iron users were associated with a 
      lower risk of hospitalizations (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99) but with a higher 
      risk of faster progression to end-stage renal disease (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 
      1.01-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Iron supplementation is associated with 15% risk 
      reduction in death among CKD 5 ND patients who received ESA treatment. Randomized 
      studies are needed to validate this association.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of oral versus intravenous iron in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 445-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether intravenous iron or oral iron repletion alone 
      can correct anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a 
      randomized multicenter controlled trial in adult anemic, iron-deficient 
      non-dialysis CKD (ND-CKD) patients (>or=stage 3) not receiving 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). METHODS: The participants were 
      randomized to receive either a sodium ferric gluconate complex (intravenous iron) 
      250 mg i.v. weekly x 4 or ferrous sulfate (oral iron) 325 mg t.i.d. x 42 days. 
      Hemoglobin (Hgb), ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were measured 
      serially, and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL) questionnaire was 
      administered on days 1 and 43. The primary outcome variable was change from 
      baseline (CFB) to endpoint in Hgb values. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were 
      analyzed (intravenous iron n = 36, oral iron n = 39). CFB in Hgb was similar in 
      the two groups (intravenous iron 0.4 g/dl vs. oral iron 0.2 g/dl, p = n.s.). 
      However, the increase in Hgb was only significant with intravenous iron (p < 
      0.01). In comparison to oral iron, intravenous iron achieved greater improvements 
      in ferritin (232.0 +/- 160.8 vs. 55.9 +/- 236.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and TSAT (8.3 
      +/- 7.5 vs. 2.9 +/- 8.8%, p = 0.007). Intravenous iron caused greater 
      improvements in KDQoL scores than oral iron (p < 0.05). The most common side 
      effect reported with intravenous iron was hypotension, while constipation was 
      more common with oral iron. CONCLUSIONS: Oral and intravenous iron similarly 
      increase Hgb in anemic iron-depleted ND-CKD patients not receiving ESAs. Although 
      in comparison to oral iron, intravenous iron may result in a more rapid repletion 
      of iron stores and greater improvement in quality of life, it exposes the 
      patients to a greater risk of adverse effects and increases inconvenience and 
      cost.

AB  - Administration of intravenous (IV) iron has become pivotal in the management of 
      anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since parenteral iron was 
      first introduced for human use in the 1930s, things have come a long way. Seventy 
      years ago, iron was toxic, administered as an iron oxyhydroxide complex. This 
      problem was circumvented with the introduction of compounds containing iron in a 
      core surrounded by a carbohydrate shell. The carbohydrate shell consists of 
      molecules such as dextran, sucrose, dextrin or gluconate. The first 
      dextran-containing IV iron preparations carried a small risk of anaphylaxis, but 
      the more recently introduced low molecular weight iron dextran preparation has 
      significantly less risk of this. Iron reactions occur with all IV iron 
      preparations, but are generally not thought to be immune based. Recently, newer 
      IV iron preparations have appeared in the market, including Ferumoxytol 
      (Feraheme) and ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject). These latest IV iron 
      preparations do not contain a requirement for a test dose, and a much higher dose 
      of iron can be delivered as a single administration. Thus, giving supplemental 
      iron to man has come a long way since 1930s; we are now in an era when we are 
      able to administer higher doses of iron with acceptable safety and without 
      significant adverse effects. However, the long-term safety of the newer IV iron 
      preparations is not yet established.

TI  - Association between hepcidin, haemoglobin level and iron status in stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease patients with anaemia.
PG  - 354-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the probable association of serum hepcidin and haemoglobin 
      levels with iron and inflammation statuses in patients of chronic kidney disease 
      stage 4 with anaemia. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at Tabriz 
      University of Medical Sciences, Iran, from March 2011 to October 2012, and 
      comprised patients of chronic kidney disease stage 4 with anaemia. Serum 
      biochemical factors as well as hepcidin, ferritin, interleukin 6, high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein and iron levels were measured using standard 
      methods. Statistical correlations were established using regression analysis and 
      Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were 40 patients among whom 
      15(37.5%) were males and 25(62.5%) were females with an overall mean age of 
      55.68±14.4 years. There was a significant inverse relationship between hepcidin 
      and haemoglobin levels (p<0.05). There were significant correlations between 
      hepcidin with iron status, nutritional and inflammatory markers such as ferritin, 
      Total iron binding capacity, albumin and interleukin 6 (p<0.05 each). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hepcidin had negative correlation with haemoglobin level in stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease patients with adequate iron stores, which could be 
      effective in the development of anaemia in such patients.

TI  - Low serum iron is associated with anemia in CKD stage 1-4 patients with normal 
      transferrin saturations.
PG  - 8343
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-87401-w [doi]
LID - 8343
AB  - Low transferrin saturation (TSAT), calculated by serum iron divided by total 
      iron-binding capacity (TIBC), indicates iron deficiency. Because malnutrition and 
      inflammation are associated with low TIBC in chronic kidney disease (CKD), TSAT 
      might not reflect iron status or risk for anemia. We examined whether low serum 
      iron was a risk factor for anemia in CKD patients with normal TSAT. Thus we 
      compare the risk for anemia in 2500 CKD stage 1-4 patients divided by TSAT 
      (cutoff: 20%) and serum iron (cutoff: 70 μg/dL in men, 60 μg/dL in women). Our 
      results confirmed low TIBC (< 200 μg/dL) was associated with hypoalbuminemia and 
      high C-reactive protein. In fully-adjusted logistic regression, both "normal TSAT 
      low iron" and "low TSAT low iron" groups were associated with baseline anemia 
      (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) (odds ratios (OR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.13-2.16 and OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.76-3.18, respectively) compared with the 
      reference group (normal TSAT normal iron). Sensitivity tests with different 
      cutoffs for TSAT and iron also showed similar results. In patients without 
      anemia, both groups were associated with anemia after 1 year (OR 1.69; 95% CI 
      1.00-2.83 and OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.11-3.40, respectively). In conclusion, CKD stage 
      1-4 patients with normal TSAT but low serum iron are still at risk for anemia.

TI  - Creative iron management--a practical guide.
PG  - 32-5
LID - 10.1111/j.1755-6686.2009.00124.x [doi]
AB  - The use of intravenous (IV) iron is now part of the every day management of 
      anaemia in people with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The increase in the number 
      of referrals to renal services since the introduction of estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) reporting in 2006 in England means that people with CKD 
      are being identified earlier and consequently, complications such as anaemia are 
      being highlighted sooner. The prevalence of anaemia of CKD has been estimated in 
      a population study of stage 3-5 CKD as 4.5% (John et al. 2004). People with stage 
      3 CKD and diabetes have a 22% incidence of anaemia that is much greater than the 
      incidence of 7.9% in those without diabetes (El Achkar et al. 2005). The increase 
      in numbers requiring anaemia management is having an impact on resources and 
      service provision, in particular the treatment of iron deficiency with IV iron. A 
      need to be creative and investigate alternative ways of using resources and 
      providing services in different settings was identified by the multiprofessional 
      members of the Anaemia Nurse Specialist Association (ANSA) and the CKD forum (a 
      project group of the British Renal Society). The outcome has been the production 
      of a practical guide for healthcare professionals to assist with the development 
      of IV iron services in a nonacute hospital setting. The guide was launched at the 
      annual ANSA conference (April 2009) and British Renal Society conference (June 
      2009).

TI  - A prospective observational study of effectiveness and safety of iron 
      isomaltoside in patients with chronic renal failure and iron deficiency anemia .
PG  - 310-318
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness, safety, and 
      tolerability of iron isomaltoside in routine practical care of iron deficiency 
      anemia (IDA) in patients with chronic renal failure. METHODS: The study included 
      698 patients with IDA on dialysis or with nondialysis chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) stages 3 - 5 designated by their physicians for treatment with iron 
      isomaltoside. Data were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 9 months. 
      Effectiveness data included measurement of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit, i-iron, 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT), and i-ferritin. Safety data included adverse 
      events and safety laboratory variables. RESULTS: Following administration of a 
      mean cumulative dose of 2,574 mg isomaltoside over 9 months, initial average Hb 
      increased from 11.0 g/dL to 11.6 g/dL, TSAT from 19.4% to 28.3%, and i-ferritin 
      from 320 µg/L to 642 µg/L, demonstrating a positive effect of iron isomaltoside 
      on iron deficiency. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the use of 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) (regarding epoetin α, initial mean dose 
      40,688 IU/month, final dose 35,665 IU/month, -13.7%, p < 0.001). No drug-related 
      adverse events were reported. Furthermore, safety parameters including 
      i-phosphate indicated no abnormal changes. CONCLUSIONS: Iron isomaltoside 
      demonstrated very good effectiveness and tolerability in patients with stage 
      3 - 5 CKD, including an ESA saving effect. .

TI  - Safety of high-dose iron sucrose infusion in hospitalized patients with chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 731-4
AB  - PURPOSE: The safety of high-dose iron sucrose infusion in hospitalized patients 
      with chronic kidney disease was studied. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was 
      conducted at a 478-bed community hospital. A medical informatics search was 
      performed to identify all hospitalized patients who were prescribed i.v. iron 
      sucrose to deliver elemental iron 300 mg every other day for three doses between 
      January and December 2002. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the analysis 
      if they had chronic kidney disease, had an estimated creatinine clearance of <60 
      mL/min, and were prescribed the above regimen. Information on iron 
      administration, vital signs, hematologic values, and iron indexes was gathered 
      from patients' medical records. Medical record review was also used to identify 
      possible adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients met eligibility criteria 
      and received a total of 167 doses of iron sucrose. Twenty adverse events were 
      judged as possibly related to iron sucrose administration and included nausea (n 
      = 8 events), reduced blood pressure (n = 4), vomiting (n = 2), dysgeusia (n = 2), 
      constipation (n = 2), fatigue (n = 1), and anxiety (n = 1). The majority of these 
      adverse events were low in severity, as determined by an objective scale. No 
      severe adverse events occurred. There was no association between infusion rate 
      and the occurrence of potential adverse events (p = 0.44). CONCLUSION: 
      Every-other-day i.v. infusion of iron sucrose, to deliver elemental iron 300 
      mg/dose, was associated with adverse events that were relatively uncommon, minor 
      in severity, and unlikely to require medical intervention.

TI  - The Impact of Intravenous Iron Supplementation on Hematinic Parameters and 
      Erythropoietin Requirements in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 4413-4424
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01826-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anemia is one of the most common complications of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). As a result of the side effects of high doses of recombinant human 
      erythropoietin (rhEPO) and the differences in the standard dose of the injectable 
      iron, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of high and low intravenous iron 
      supplementation on hematinic parameters and EPO requirements in patients under 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial 
      was conducted on 60 patients with CKD admitted to Sina and 29 Bahman hospitals in 
      Tabriz, Iran in 2019-2020 to undergo hemodialysis. In the two studied groups, low 
      (100 mg/week) and high (400 mg/week) doses of iron were administered and subjects 
      were followed up for 6 months. The incidence of acute myocardial ischemia, 
      stroke, and mortality during 6 months was recorded. RESULTS: The required rhEPO 
      dosage (mg/week) to maintain hemoglobin levels between 10 and 12 g/dL in the 
      high-dose iron group was significantly decreased during the follow-up period 
      (52,129.03 ± 23,810 vs. 45,760 ± 20,978.71, P ≤ 0.028). Transferrin saturation 
      (TSAT) index had a significant upward trend after iron injection and significant 
      correlations with the serum levels of Fe (r ≥ 0.353, P ≤ 0.007), ferritin 
      (r ≥ 0.315, P ≤ 0.016), and total iron binding capacity (r ≥ 0.219, P < 0.050) 
      during the follow-up period in the studied groups. CONCLUSION: High-dose 
      intravenous iron (400 mg/week) can reduce the mean dose of rhEPO requirements and 
      increase the TSAT index over a period of 6 months in hemodialysis patients. 
      High-dose IV iron administration can decrease cardiovascular events in 
      hemodialysis patients with iron deficiency anemia.

AB  - The evaluation of iron status in dialysis patients provides information essential 
      to the planning of adequate recombinant human erythropoietin treatment. To 
      diagnose iron deficiency in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD), reticulocyte 
      hemoglobin content and percentage of hypochromic red cells are incorporated into 
      the European best practice guidelines on anemia management in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), the mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-HE) was proposed as 
      alternatives to standard biochemical tests. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content and 
      percentage of hypochromic red cells are incorporated into the European best 
      practice guidelines on anemia management in CKD. Our aim was to assess the value 
      of Ret-HE parameter, in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for detecting 
      iron deficiency, in HD patients. We studied 50 patients undergoing HD three times 
      weekly , to clarify the accuracy of Ret-HE in diagnosing iron deficiency in 
      dialysis patients, we initially compared Ret-HE with such iron parameters as 
      serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation, and hypochromic red blood cell 
      (Hypo%) which has been established as indicators of functional iron deficiency. 
      Ret-HE mean value in anemic patients was (25.84 ± 4.23 pg) and had good 
      correlation (P <0.001) between Ret-HE, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and 
      transferin saturation in dialysis patients. Receiver operating characteristic 
      curve analysis revealed, values of the area was 0.887, and at a cutoff value of 
      27.0 pg, a sensitivity of 90.4% and a specificity of 80.8% were achieved. The 
      newly proposed Ret-HE can provide clinicians with information equivalent to iron 
      deficiency anemia markers. Ret-HE is a new parameter that is easily measurable is 
      suggested as reliable parameters for the study of erythropoiesis status in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Heart Failure Hospitalization Risk associated with Iron Status in Veterans with 
      CKD.
PG  - 522-531
LID - 10.2215/CJN.15360920 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CKD is an independent risk factor for heart failure. 
      Iron dysmetabolism potentially contributes to heart failure, but this 
      relationship has not been well characterized in CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We performed a historical cohort study using data 
      from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse to evaluate the relationship 
      between iron status and heart failure hospitalization. We identified a CKD cohort 
      with at least one set of iron indices between 2006 and 2015. The first available 
      date of serum iron indices was identified as the study index date. The cohort was 
      divided into four iron groups on the basis of the joint quartiles of serum 
      transferrin saturation (shown in percent) and ferritin (shown in nanograms per 
      milliliter): reference (16%-28%, 55-205 ng/ml), low iron (0.4%-16%, 0.9-55 
      ng/ml), high iron (28%-99.5%, 205-4941 ng/ml), and function iron deficiency 
      (0.8%-16%, 109-2783 ng/ml). We compared 1-year heart failure hospitalization risk 
      between the iron groups using matching weights derived from multinomial 
      propensity score models and Poisson rate-based regression. RESULTS: A total of 
      78,551 veterans met the eligibility criteria. The covariates were well balanced 
      among the iron groups after applying the propensity score weights (n=31,819). 
      One-year adjusted relative rate for heart failure hospitalization in the iron 
      deficiency groups were higher compared with the reference group (low iron: 1.29 
      [95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.41]; functional iron deficiency: 1.25 [95% 
      confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.37]). The high-iron group was associated with 
      lower 1-year relative rate of heart failure hospitalization (0.82; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.72 to 0.92). Furthermore, the association between iron deficiency and 
      heart failure hospitalization risk remained consistent regardless of the diabetes 
      status or heart failure history at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency, 
      regardless of cause, was associated with higher heart failure hospitalization 
      risk in CKD. Higher iron status was associated with lower heart failure 
      hospitalization risks.

TI  - Role of Soluble Transferrin Receptor - An Iron Marker in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 555-559
LID - 10.4103/ijn.IJN_486_20 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron status assessment is crucial in end-stage renal disease 
      hemodialysis (ESRD-HD) patients because iron deficiency may cause 
      unresponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. Soluble transferrin 
      receptor (sTfR) is a potential iron marker that is not influenced by 
      inflammation, and the results among studies are still conflicting. This study 
      evaluated the role of sTfR in determining iron deficiency in ESRD-HD patients. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hemodialysis Unit in 
      Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Indonesia, from August to September 2018 and 
      included 127 ESRD-HD patients. The sTfR level, sTfR index (sTfR/log ferritin), 
      iron status, ferritin level, and complete blood count were assessed. Transferrin 
      saturation (TSAT) was used as a reference. The role of sTfR was analyzed using 
      the Chi-square test and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. 
      RESULTS: The median sTfR was 3.0 (range, 1.0-8.5) mg/l, and the median TSAT was 
      23% (4.0%-100%). The sTfR level in ESRD-HD patients with absolute iron deficiency 
      was 3.9 (1.9-8.5) mg/l, in those with functional iron deficiency was 3.5 
      (1.9-5.4) mg/l, and in those with no iron deficiency was 2.6 (1.0-6.4) mg/l. The 
      previous sTfR cut-off value of 2.5 mg/l had a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity 
      of 48.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.3%, and negative predictive value 
      (NPV) of 85.4%, whereas the new sTfR cut-off value of 2.71 mg/l had a sensitivity 
      of 83.3%, specificity of 56.5%, PPV of 48.6%, and NPV of 87.3%. TSAT and index 
      TSAT were not influenced by inflammation. CONCLUSION: The cut-off sTfR value of 
      2.71 mg/l is better than 2.5 mg/l to determine the iron status in ESRD-HD 
      patients.

TI  - [Iron therapy in chronic kidney disease].
PG  - 749-752
AB  - Iron deficiency is one of the main causes of anemia in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease, and iron supplements along the erythropoietin constitute the 
      basis of its therapy. Among hemodialysis patients a preferred method of iron 
      supplementation is an intravenous route, but the route of administration of iron 
      to patients with nondialysis CKD raises a lot of controversy. Treatment with oral 
      iron is cheap, does not require vascular access, but of lower efficacy due to 
      insufficient absorption and frequent occurrence of side effects from the 
      gastrointestinal, with discontinuation of therapy. Intravenous iron though 
      effective is associated with the risk of allergic reactions, oxidative stress and 
      the risk of iron overload. Modern oral medications may constitute an alternative 
      to intravenous iron.

TI  - Heme iron polypeptide for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease patients: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 64

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia secondary to iron deficiency is common in patients with 
      non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) but it is unclear if oral 
      supplementation is as effective as intravenous (IV) supplementation in 
      re-establishing iron stores. The purpose of this study was to determine if oral 
      Heme Iron Polypeptide (HIP) is as effective as IV iron sucrose in the treatment 
      of iron-deficiency anemia for patients with ND-CKD. METHODS: Forty ND-CKD 
      patients were randomized; 18 to HIP 11 mg orally 3 times per day and 22 to IV 
      iron sucrose 200 mg monthly for 6 months. Baseline clinical and laboratory data 
      were collected for all patients. The primary and secondary outcomes for the study 
      were hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration and iron indices [ferritin and percentage 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT)] at the end of 6 months respectively. Adverse 
      events were also compared. RESULTS: The baseline demographic characteristics and 
      laboratory values were similar for the two groups. After 6 months of treatment, 
      Hb in the HIP group was 117 g/L and 113 g/L in the IV sucrose group (p = 0.37). 
      The TSAT at 6 months was not different between the two groups {p = 0.82}but the 
      serum ferritin was significantly higher in the IV iron sucrose group {85.5 ug/L 
      in HIP and 244 ug/L; p = 0.004}. Overall adverse events were not different 
      between the groups. CONCLUSION: HIP is similar in efficacy to IV iron sucrose in 
      maintaining hemoglobin in ND-CKD patients with no differences in adverse events 
      over 6 months. It is unclear if the greater ferritin values in the IV iron 
      sucrose group are clinically significant. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov:

      anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease: linking treatment to an 
      outpatient clinic, optimizing service provision and patient choice.
PG  - 996-1001

AB  - RATIONALE: The National Service Framework advocates correction of anaemia in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral iron is insufficient, while 
      intravenous (IV) supplementation replenishes and maintains iron stores. In 
      Yorkshire numerous peripheral clinics exist to reduce travel for patients, but 
      patients must travel to the main unit for IV iron therapy. Therefore an 
      outpatient service in tandem with a routine clinic for administration of IV 
      CosmoFer was created. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and benefits of IV 
      iron therapy in the outpatient clinic during active patient review for CKD 
      patients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of patients attending for total dose IV 
      iron (n = 57) at a peripheral clinic. Iron was administered and monitored 
      according to protocol by one of the clinic nurses with medical staff available in 
      the adjoining room. Haemoglobin, ferritin and renal function were recorded 
      pre-infusion and after 4-6 months. Results are given as medians/means +/- 
      standard error. RESULTS: A total of 76 IV infusions were carried out with no 
      reported side effects or haemodynamic instability. Haemoglobin (median 10.9 vs. 
      11.3 g dL(-1), P = NS), creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) over the 6-month period remained stable. Serum ferritin rose significantly 
      [80.9 +/- 6.2 vs. 186.4 +/- 18.2 g L(-1) (P < 0.001)]. Hospital time saved 380 
      day case bed hours, doctor hours saved 76 hours, and patient hours saved 3 
      hours/patient. Cost savings for TDI CosmoFer in peripheral clinic versus in 
      centre therapy and versus sucrose, respectively, for 76 treatments was pound 
      5749.40 and pound 46,320.80 respectively. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated, in a 
      resource-limited service, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a management 
      care pathway for patients with CKD, in a peripheral clinic, to receive total dose 
      IV CosmoFer without disruption of a functioning renal clinic.

TI  - Iron treatment and the TREAT trial.
PG  - i3-i5
AB  - Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) enables the correction of 
      anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, thus reducing its symptoms and 
      complications. Not only is iron therapy aimed at correcting iron deficiency, but 
      also it is an adjuvant therapy in CKD patients receiving ESAs. Iron stores in CKD 
      patients may be near normal, but there may be insufficient immediately available 
      iron to optimize ESA therapy. In this context, iron therapy significantly reduces 
      ESA dose requirements. Erythropoiesis following ESA therapy may precipitate iron 
      deficiency in association with increased platelet production. In the TREAT trial, 
      the 'placebo group' did not receive a true 'placebo' since 46% of the patients 
      had at least one dose of ESA and achieved progressively increased haemoglobin 
      (Hb) values during follow-up against the common observation. The patients in the 
      'placebo' group were treated more frequently with intravenous iron than the 
      darbepoetin group. Given that many patients were relatively iron deficient at 
      baseline, iron administration was successful in many of them in obtaining and 
      maintaining partial anaemia correction without the need for ESAs, thus 
      underlining the great importance of iron supplementation in correcting anaemia. 
      The upper safety limit for iron administered to patients in order to minimize, as 
      much as possible, the ESA dose and the upper limit for ESA dosage for maintaining 
      the target Hb range as suggested by the current guidelines are still open 
      questions.

TI  - Epoetin beta pegol alleviates oxidative stress and exacerbation of renal damage 
      from iron deposition, thereby delaying CKD progression in progressive 
      glomerulonephritis rats.
LID - 10.14814/phy2.12637 [doi]
LID - e12637
AB  - The increased deposition of iron in the kidneys that occurs with glomerulopathy 
      hinders the functional and structural recovery of the tubules and promotes 
      progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we evaluated whether epoetin 
      beta pegol (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator: CERA), which has a long 
      half-life in blood and strongly suppresses hepcidin-25, exerts renoprotection in 
      a rat model of chronic progressive glomerulonephritis (cGN). cGN rats showed 
      elevated urinary total protein excretion (uTP) and plasma urea nitrogen (UN) from 
      day 14 after the induction of kidney disease (day 0) and finally declined into 
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), showing reduced creatinine clearance with 
      glomerulosclerosis, tubular dilation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. A single 
      dose of CERA given on day 1, but not on day 16, alleviated increasing uTP and UN, 
      thereby delaying ESKD. In the initial disease phase, CERA significantly 
      suppressed urinary 8-OHdG and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a 
      tubular damage marker. CERA also inhibited elevated plasma hepcidin-25 levels and 
      alleviated subsequent iron accumulation in kidneys in association with elevated 
      urinary iron excretion and resulted in alleviation of growth of Ki67-positive 
      tubular and glomerular cells. In addition, at day 28 when the exacerbation of uTP 
      occurs, a significant correlation was observed between iron deposition in the 
      kidney and urinary L-FABP. In our study, CERA mitigated increasing kidney damage, 
      thereby delaying CKD progression in this glomerulonephritis rat model. 
      Alleviation by CERA of the exacerbation of kidney damage could be attributable to 
      mitigation of tubular damage that might occur with lowered iron deposition in 
      tubules.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) is a definitive treatment 
      for anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). During long-term rHuEpo treatment 
      most patients develop and show persistent iron deficiency in spite of oral iron 
      supplementation. Abnormalities of iron absorption and transport in the duodenum 
      may contribute to this deficiency. METHODS: To investigate changes in iron 
      absorption and transport in CKD and iron deficiency against the background of 
      rHuEpo treatment, we used severely anaemic rats with adenine-induced renal 
      failure (adenine rats) and sham-treated control rats given only the vehicle. 
      After 4 weeks on adenine or the vehicle, the rats were divided into four groups 
      according to whether or not they received rHuEpo for the next 4 weeks: 
      rHuEpo(-)-adenine, rHuEpo(-)-control, rHuEpo(+)-adenine and rHuEpo(+)-control. We 
      evaluated the effects of rHuEpo treatment on iron balance, duodenal mRNA 
      expression of molecules related to iron absorption and transport and hepatic mRNA 
      expression of hepcidin. RESULTS: Treatment with rHuEpo improved anaemia and 
      induced iron deficiency only in the adenine rats, in whom the expression of mRNAs 
      for ferroportin 1 and hephaestin 1 increased and for divalent metal transporter 1 
      (DMT1) was unchanged. In contrast, control rats treated with rHuEpo showed no 
      changes. Hepcidin mRNA expression was greater in adenine rats than in control 
      rats. CONCLUSIONS: In the adenine rats, rHuEpo treatment improved renal anaemia 
      and induced persistent iron deficiency. An alteration of mRNA expression of 
      molecules related to iron metabolism in renal insufficiency may be one of the 
      reasons for this iron deficiency.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease, anemia and malnutrition coupled with inflammation as 
      malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrom are common and considered as 
      morbidity-mortality factors. The link between these two factors has been 
      described at length in the literature highlighting an association of malnutrition 
      with iron deficiency considered itself as one of the causes of anemia in chronic 
      kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis). Our study aims to know the 
      prevalence of these two factors in a population of chronic kidney disease 
      (non-dialysis and hemodialysis) of Algiers and to highlight the possible 
      associations between them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a multicentre, 
      cross-sectional and descriptive study carried out over a period of 6months 
      (August 2018 to January 2019). Anemia and malnutrition were assessed by various 
      biological and clinical tools such as the malnutrition inflammation score and the 
      International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism criteria. Statistical 
      tests were performed on the R studio software, considering P<0.05 as a 
      statistically significant value. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine patients on 
      chronic kidney disease were included (90 non dialysis and 119 hemodialysis). The 
      median age was 70 (IQR=16) for non dialysis and 56 (IQR=16.5) for hemodialysis. 
      The prevalence of anemia was 66.66% (n=60) in non dialysis and 70.58% (n=84) in 
      hemodialysis. Absolute iron deficiency anemia was higher in non dialysis (48.33%; 
      n=29) while functional iron deficiency anemia was higher in hemodialysis (34.52%; 
      n=29). The prevalence of malnutrition by malnutrition inflammation score was 
      relatively low. Only functional iron deficiency anemia was associated with 
      malnutrition. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anemia was higher in Algerian chronic 
      kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis) unlike malnutrition which remains 
      associated with functional iron deficiency anemia.

TI  - Introducing iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®)-development rationale and clinical 
      experience.
PG  - i10-i13
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often suffer from iron deficiency 
      anaemia necessitating treatment with intravenous (IV) iron. Several studies 
      demonstrate that oral iron is insufficient in these patients and that IV 
      supplementation is a more effective treatment. Until now, use of available 
      parenteral iron preparations has been limited by dosing schedules and the need, 
      in some cases, for a test dose, and despite the availability of a range of 
      different IV iron compounds, there is still a need for improved compounds. The 
      new IV iron, iron isomaltoside 1000 Monofer®, is composed of iron and chemically 
      modified isomalto-oligosaccharides which have a mean molecular weight of 1000 Da 
      and consist predominantly of 3-5 glucose units. In contrast to dextrans, the 
      carbohydrate isomaltoside 1000 is a linear and unbranched structure with 
      theoretically a low immunological potential. Hence, a test dose is not necessary. 
      Iron isomaltoside 1000 contains strongly bound iron within the iron-isomaltoside 
      formulation, which enables a controlled slow release of bioavailable iron to the 
      iron-binding proteins, with potentially a reduced risk of free iron toxicity. 
      This allows flexible dosing including high and rapid dosing securing convenient 
      iron therapy for a wide range of patients. The development of Monofer® has been 
      enthusiastically acknowledged by clinicians, and in 2009, there has been fast 
      approval by European authorities via a decentralized registration procedure. This 
      new IV iron is currently being marketed in several European countries. This 
      article describes the development rationale and summarizes the clinical data 
      assessing the use of iron isomaltoside 1000 administered without a test dose by 
      either repeated bolus injections or fast high single iron infusions [defined as 
      total dose infusion (TDI)] to patients suffering from CKD. Since CKD is 
      associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, data from a small 
      trial applying high single doses of iron isomatoside 1000 in patients with 
      chronic heart failure (CHF) are also reviewed. Collectively, the available data 
      demonstrate adequate efficacy and a good safety profile of iron isomaltoside 1000 
      in CKD and CHF patients even when administered without a test dose and as single 
      rapid high-dose infusions.

TI  - Effect of Ferric Citrate versus Ferrous Sulfate on Iron and Phosphate Parameters 
      in Patients with Iron Deficiency and CKD: A Randomized Trial.
PG  - 1251-1258
LID - 10.2215/CJN.15291219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ferric citrate is an oral medication approved for 
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with CKD not requiring dialysis. 
      The relative efficacy of ferric citrate versus ferrous sulfate in treating iron 
      deficiency in patients with CKD is unclear. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: We randomized 60 adults with moderate to severe CKD (eGFR 15-45 
      ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and iron deficiency (transferrin saturation [TSAT] ≤30% and 
      ferritin ≤300 ng/ml) to ferric citrate (2 g three times a day with meals, n=30) 
      or ferrous sulfate (325 mg three times a day, n=30) for 12 weeks. Primary 
      outcomes were change in TSAT and ferritin from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary 
      outcomes were change in hemoglobin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and 
      hepcidin. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between study 
      arms. There was a greater increase in TSAT (between-group difference in mean 
      change, 8%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1 to 15; P=0.02) and ferritin 
      (between-group difference in mean change, 37 ng/ml; 95% CI, 10 to 64; P=0.009) 
      from baseline to 12 weeks in participants randomized to ferric citrate as 
      compared with ferrous sulfate. Similarly, as compared with ferrous sulfate, 
      treatment with ferric citrate resulted in a greater increase in hepcidin from 
      baseline to 12 weeks (between-group difference, 69 pg/ml; 95% CI, 8 to 130). 
      There were no between-group differences in mean change for hemoglobin (0.3 g/dl; 
      95% CI, -0.2 to 0.8), intact FGF23 (-29 pg/ml; 95% CI, -59 to 0.1), or C-terminal 
      FGF23 (61 RU/ml; 95% CI, -181 to 58). The incidence of adverse events did not 
      differ between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with ferrous sulfate, 
      treatment with ferric citrate for 12 weeks resulted in a greater mean increase in 
      TSAT and ferritin concentrations in individuals with moderate to severe CKD and 
      iron deficiency. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: Impact of 
      Ferric Citrate vs Ferrous Sulfate on Iron Parameters and Hemoglobin in 
      Individuals With Moderate to Severe Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) With Iron 
      Deficiency, NCT02888171.

TI  - Comparison of intravenous iron sucrose to oral iron in the treatment of anemic 
      patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis.
PG  - c55-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies compare oral to intravenous (IV) iron for managing anemia 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis. METHODS: We 
      enrolled 96 CKD anemic patients on erythropoietin in a randomized, open-label, 
      multicenter, controlled study. Patients received 29 days of oral FeSO4 (325 mg 
      t.i.d.) or intravenous (IV) iron sucrose (5 doses of 200 mg weekly). Assessments 
      were made up to 14 days after the last dose. Primary endpoints were changes in 
      hemoglobin and ferritin, and clinical success was evaluated from the percent of 
      patients with combined endpoints of rises in hemoglobin/ferritin, 
      hemoglobin/ferritin/TSAT, and hemoglobin/TSAT. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference in hemoglobin values between IV and oral therapy. IV iron patients had 
      greater increases in mean serum ferritin (288 ng/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oral 
      iron patients (-5.1 ng/ml, p = NS). IV iron patients with baseline ferritin < 100 
      ng/ml had a greater increase in hemoglobin (1.4 g/dl) compared to oral iron 
      patients (0.9 g/dl) (p < 0.05). More IV iron patients (54.2%) attained hemoglobin 
      values > 11.0 g/dl compared to oral iron patients (31.3%, p = 0.028), and met 
      hemoglobin/ferritin (62.5%), hemoglobin/TSAT (47.9%), hemoglobin/ferritin/TSAT 
      (43.8%), and ferritin/TSAT criteria (54.2%) than oral iron patients (0, 22.9, 0, 
      and 0%, respectively). There were no serious side effects. CONCLUSIONS: These CKD 
      patients had increases in both hemoglobin and ferritin following IV iron therapy, 
      whereas those treated with oral iron had increases in hemoglobin without 
      increases in iron stores. Iron sucrose, given weekly as 200 mg IV push over 5 min 
      is an effective and safe anemia treatment in this population.

      session.
PG  - 2465-71
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr711 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study analysed, in vivo and in vitro, the effects of four 
      different intravenous iron preparations (iron gluconate, iron sucrose, iron 
      dextran and ferric carboxymaltose) on activation and damage of mononuclear cells. 
      METHODS: A randomized prospective study was conducted in 10 haemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. Blood samples were collected at baseline (T0); 1 h after starting HD, 
      just before the iron or saline administration (T1); 30 min after the iron or 
      saline infusion (T2) and at the end of HD (T3). In addition, peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells from 10 healthy individuals and 9 chronic kidney disease 
      Stage-5 (CKD-5) without HD treatment were cultured with the 4 iron preparations. 
      RESULTS: Iron infusion during the HD session increased the percentage of 
      mononuclear cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, Inter-Cellular 
      Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and apoptosis. There were no significant differences 
      between the four iron preparations. Culture of mononuclear cells from healthy 
      individuals and CKD-5 patients with the different iron preparations resulted in a 
      significant increase in ROS, ICAM-1 and apoptosis as compared with control. In an 
      additional study, the effect of original iron sucrose formulation on mononuclear 
      cells was compared with that of one generic formulation. The generic formulation 
      produced a greater increase in ROS, ICAM-1 and apoptosis than the original iron 
      sucrose. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that intravenous iron has deleterious 
      effects on mononuclear cells. The four iron compounds evaluated produced similar 
      effects on oxidative stress, cell activation and apoptosis. However, the effects 
      of iron compounds with the same formulation were different, thus further 
      investigation may be required to establish the safety of iron preparations that 
      theoretically have the same composition.

TI  - Effect of oral liposomal iron versus intravenous iron for treatment of iron 
      deficiency anaemia in CKD patients: a randomized trial.
PG  - 645-52
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfu357 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia in non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD). Controversies exist about the optimal route of 
      administration for iron therapy. Liposomal iron, a new generation oral iron with 
      high gastrointestinal absorption and bioavailability and a low incidence of side 
      effects, seems to be a promising new strategy of iron replacement. Therefore, we 
      conducted a study to determine whether liposomal iron, compared with intravenous 
      (IV) iron, improves anaemia in ND-CKD patients. METHODS: In this randomized, 
      open-label trial, 99 patients with CKD (stage 3-5, not on dialysis) and iron 
      deficiency anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) ≤12 g/dL, ferritin ≤100 ng/mL, transferrin 
      saturation ≤25%] were assigned (2:1) to receive oral liposomal iron (30 mg/day, 
      Group OS) or a total dose of 1000 mg of IV iron gluconate (125 mg infused weekly) 
      (Group IV) for 3 months. The patients were followed-up for the treatment period 
      and 1 month after drug withdrawal. The primary end point was to evaluate the 
      effects of the two treatments on Hb levels; the iron status, compliance and 
      adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: The short-term therapy with IV iron 
      produced a more rapid Hb increase compared with liposomal iron, although the 
      final increase in Hb was similar with either treatment; the difference between 
      the groups was statistically significant at the first month and such difference 
      disappeared at the end of treatment. After iron withdrawal, Hb concentrations 
      remained stable in Group IV, while recovered to baseline in the OS group. The 
      replenishment of iron stores was greater in the IV group. The incidence of 
      adverse event was significantly lower in the oral group (P < 0.001), and the 
      adherence was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that oral 
      liposomal iron is a safe and efficacious alternative to IV iron gluconate to 
      correct anaemia in ND-CKD patients, although its effects on repletion of iron 
      stores and on stability of Hb after drug discontinuation are lower.

TI  - Ferumoxytol for iron deficiency anemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis. 
      The FACT randomized controlled trial .
PG  - 237-245
LID - 10.5414/CN109512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing dialysis often 
      require intravenous iron for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The Ferumoxytol for Anemia of CKD Trial (FACT), a randomized, multicenter, 
      open-label, phase 4 study, compared the long-term safety and efficacy of 
      ferumoxytol with iron sucrose for the treatment of IDA in patients with CKD 
      undergoing hemodialysis. Patients with IDA and CKD undergoing hemodialysis were 
      randomized 2:1 to ferumoxytol 1.02 g (2 × 510 mg) or iron sucrose 1.0 g (10 × 
      100 mg) for a 5-week treatment period (TP). Over 11 months, patients underwent 
      additional 5-week TPs whenever IDA (hemoglobin < 11.5 g/dL and transferrin 
      saturation < 30%) was detected. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in 
      hemoglobin from baseline to week 5 for each TP. Adverse events were recorded 
      during the study. RESULTS: Overall, 293 patients received ferumoxytol (n = 196) 
      or iron sucrose (n = 97). Ferumoxytol was noninferior to iron sucrose regarding 
      hemoglobin change from baseline to week 5. The mean change in hemoglobin in the 
      ferumoxytol and iron sucrose groups was 0.5 and 0.4 g/dL, respectively, in TP 1 
      (least-squares mean difference, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, -0.11 to 0.36) and 
      0.6 and 0.3 g/dL, respectively, in TP 2 (0.30; 0.06 - 0.55). Treatment-related 
      and serious adverse events were similar in both groups; no new safety signals 
      emerged. CONCLUSION: Long-term administration of ferumoxytol has noninferior 
      efficacy and a similar safety profile to iron sucrose when used to treat IDA in 
      patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis. .

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Jian-Pi-Yi-Shen (JPYS) is a herbal decoction 
      being used to relieve the symptoms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its 
      complications, including anemia, for over twenty years. Nonetheless, it is 
      unclear how JPYS influences renal anemia and iron metabolism. AIM OF THE STUDY: 
      An analysis of network pharmacology, chemical profiling, and in vivo experiments 
      was conducted to identify the impact of JPYS on JAK2-STAT3 pathway and iron 
      utilization in renal anemia and CKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical 
      properties of JPYS and its exposed ingredients were detected in vivo. And based 
      on the aforesaid chemical compounds, the potential targets and signaling pathways 
      of JPYS for renal anemia treatment were predicted by network pharmacology. 
      Afterward, an adenine-feeding animal model of CKD-related anemia was developed to 
      verify the mechanism by which JPYS modulates iron recycling to treat renal 
      anemia. Renal injury was estimated by serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen 
      (BUN), histopathological examinations and fibrosis degree. Western blot, 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry approaches were utilized to assess 
      the levels of JAK2, STAT3 and iron metabolism-related factors. RESULTS: There 
      were 164 active ingredients identified in JPYS, including prototypes and 
      metabolites in vivo were identified in JPYS, and 21 core targets were found 
      through network pharmacology based on topological characteristics. Combined with 
      the core targets and pathway enrichment analysis, the majority of the candidate 
      targets were associated with the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathways. Experimental 
      results indicated that JPYS treatment significantly decreased the expression of 
      BUN and Scr, restored renal pathological damage, down-regulated fibrosis degree, 
      and improved hematological parameters such as red blood cell, hemoglobin and 
      hematocrit in CKD rats. Furthermore, JPYS significantly restored iron metabolism 
      from dysregulation by increasing the levels of iron and ferritin in the serum, 
      inhibiting the production of hepcidin in liver and serum, and regulating 
      transferrin receptor 1 in bone marrow. Meanwhile, the expression of JAK2 and 
      STAT3 was suppressed by JPYS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, JPYS 
      reduces hepcidin levels by inhibiting the activation of JAK2-STAT3 signaling, 
      thereby protecting against iron deficiency anemia.

AB  - Impaired energy metabolism is a feature of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Iron 
      deficiency has been shown to reduce energy production in the cell in animals and 
      humans. Iron deficiency is common in both Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and in 
      CHF. Recent studies suggest that iron deficiency is an independent risk factor 
      for mortality in CHF. Studies of correction of the anemia with intravenous (IV) 
      iron in both CKD and CHF have shown an improvement in the anemia and, in some 
      cases, in the renal function as well. Some CHF studies of correction of the iron 
      deficiency have shown an improvement in cardiac function and structure as well as 
      in exercise capacity and quality of life. This occurred independent of whether or 
      not they had anemia, suggesting that the iron deficiency itself may be 
      independently contributing to the worsening of the CHF and CKD. If future 
      long-term studies confirm the safety and efficacy of IV iron in the treatment of 
      iron deficiency in CKD and CHF, this will become a new addition to the 
      therapeutic armamentarium of the cardiorenal syndrome, and parameters of iron 
      deficiency will become part of the routine measurements performed in both CKD and 
      CHF whether or not the patient is anemic.

TI  - Ferumoxytol versus iron sucrose treatment: a post-hoc analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials in patients with varying renal function and iron deficiency 
      anemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia is highly prevalent in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease and is often treated with intravenous iron. There are few trials 
      directly comparing the safety and efficacy of different intravenous iron 
      products. METHODS: This post-hoc analysis pooled data from 767 patients enrolled 
      in two randomized, controlled, open-label trials of similar design comparing the 
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia with ferumoxytol and iron sucrose across 
      patients with all stages of renal function. One trial was conducted in adults 
      with CKD either on or not on dialysis and the second in adults with IDA of any 
      underlying cause and a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom 
      oral iron could not be used who had normal to no worse than moderately impaired 
      renal function. Patients were categorized by chronic kidney disease stage (i.e., 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the 
      mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5. RESULTS: The overall incidence 
      of adverse events was numerically lower in ferumoxytol-treated patients compared 
      to those treated with iron sucrose (42.4 vs. 50.2 %, respectively); the incidence 
      of treatment-related adverse events was generally similar between the two 
      treatment groups (13.6 vs. 16.0 %, respectively). Adverse events of Special 
      Interest (i.e., hypotension, hypersensitivity) occurred at lower rates in those 
      treated with ferumoxytol compared to those treated with iron sucrose (2.5 vs. 
      5.3 %, respectively). Overall, mean hemoglobin increased in both treatment 
      groups, regardless of degree of renal insufficiency, although greater increases 
      were seen among those with less severe kidney damage. Mean increases in 
      hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 were significantly greater with ferumoxytol 
      than with iron sucrose treatment in the subgroup with an estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate ≥90 mL/min (Least Squares mean difference = 0.53 g/dL; 
      p < 0.001). There were no other consistent, significant differences in hemoglobin 
      levels between treatment groups for the other chronic kidney disease categories 
      except for isolated instances favoring ferumoxytol. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and 
      safety of ferumoxytol is at least comparable to iron sucrose in patients with 
      varying degrees of renal function. TRIAL REGISTRATION: (CKD-201; 
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01052779; registered 15 January, 2010),

TI  - Receipt of Intravenous Iron and Clinical Outcomes among Hemodialysis Patients 
      Hospitalized for Infection.
PG  - 1799-805
LID - 10.2215/CJN.01090115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Anemia guidelines for CKD recommend withholding 
      intravenous iron in the setting of active infection, although no data 
      specifically support this recommendation. This study aimed to examine the 
      association between intravenous iron and clinical outcomes among hemodialysis 
      patients hospitalized for infection. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study using data from 
      the US Renal Data System of 22,820 adult Medicare beneficiaries on in-center 
      hemodialysis who had received intravenous iron in the 14 days preceding their 
      first hospitalization for bacterial infection in 2010. In multivariable analyses, 
      the association between receipt of intravenous iron at any point from the day of 
      hospital admission to discharge and all-cause 30-day mortality, mortality in 
      2010, length of hospital stay, and readmission for infection or death within 30 
      days of discharge was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 2463 patients (10.8%) who 
      received intravenous iron at any point from the day of admission to discharge. 
      Receipt of intravenous iron was not associated with age, dialysis vintage, or 
      comorbidities. There were 2618 deaths within 30 days of admission and 6921 deaths 
      in 2010 (median follow-up 173 days; 25th and 75th percentiles, 78-271 days). The 
      median length of stay was 7 days (25th and 75th percentiles, 5-12 days). Receipt 
      of intravenous iron was not associated with higher 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 
      0.86; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.74 to 1.00), higher mortality in 2010 
      (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00), longer mean length of stay (10.1 days 
      [95% CI, 9.7 to 10.5] versus 10.5 days [95% CI, 10.3 to 10.7]; P=0.05), or 
      readmission for infection or death within 30 days of discharge (odds ratio, 1.08; 
      95% CI, 0.96 to 1.22) compared with no receipt of intravenous iron. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This analysis does not support withholding intravenous iron upon admission for 
      bacterial infection in hemodialysis patients, although clinical trials are 
      required to make definitive recommendations.

TI  - Is hepcidin the star player in iron metabolism in chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 873-4
LID - 10.1038/ki.2009.46 [doi]
AB  - It is well known that abnormal iron metabolism contributes to the development of 
      anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Hepcidin is a circulating 
      peptide produced in the liver that regulates efflux of iron from the cells. Ashby 
      et al. measured the serum level of hepcidin using a new assay. Although the new 
      assay produced mixed results and needs to be verified, these data suggest that 
      hepcidin is not the only star player in iron metabolism in CKD.

TI  - Low hepcidin triggers hepatic iron accumulation in patients with hepatitis C.
PG  - 1141-4
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft467 [doi]
AB  - Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver 
      disease including fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic 
      hepatitis C (CHC) is also a problem in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), particularly in those on haemodialysis. Excessive iron in the liver of CHC 
      patients contributes to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally HCC, while iron 
      depletion is beneficial. In CHC patients without CKD, in HCV-infected 
      experimental animals and in cell culture studies, serum hepcidin levels and/or 
      cellular hepcidin expression are low and directly suppressed by HCV, radical 
      oxygen species, growth factors and/or transcription factors. In contrast, 
      antiviral therapy (e.g. with pegylated interferon-alpha combined with ribavirin) 
      raises hepcidin levels and reduces iron overload in patients with CHC. Hepcidin 
      directly inhibits HCV replication mediated by STAT3 activation. HCV circumvents 
      hepatic innate antiviral defence by lowering hepcidin. If hepcidin is also low in 
      CKD patients with CHC, iron supplementation should be avoided even in CKD 
      patients with CHC treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

TI  - Management of anemia and iron deficiency in heart failure.
PG  - 532-48
LID - 10.1007/s11936-010-0095-4 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality and 
      morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). The diagnosis of anemia should 
      prompt assessment of the underlying cause(s), first by using routine laboratory 
      measurements (i.e., serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      [eGFR], serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, folic acid, 
      and thyroid stimulating hormone). In clinical practice, it remains unclear 
      whether using levels of the soluble transferrin receptor in HF patients to assess 
      iron deficiency is warranted. Further investigation should follow these simple 
      tests when judged appropriate (e.g., if occult gastrointestinal blood losses are 
      suspected). Hemodilution may contribute significantly to anemia in patients with 
      advanced HF and may be suspected when signs of hypervolemia are present. 
      Euvolemia should be the first goal in such cases (as always), followed by 
      optimization of the disease-modifying therapies used in HF 
      (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, 
      β-blockers, or aldosterone antagonists and cardiac resynchronization therapy in 
      selected cases). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) can be used to improve 
      functional capacity in patients with significant chronic kidney disease (CKD), a 
      frequent comorbidity in HF patients. ESA and iron therapy is recommended in 
      patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), with a target 
      hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL. In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled 
      clinical trial, weekly administration of intravenous iron significantly improved 
      symptoms, New York Heart Association class, quality of life, and exercise 
      capacity in both anemic and non-anemic HF patients. A trend toward fewer 
      hospitalizations was seen in the group treated with intravenous iron. The rates 
      of adverse events were similar in the treatment and the placebo groups. 
      Larger-scale and longer-term studies are needed to establish the safety and 
      efficacy profile of intravenous iron in non-CKD HF patients and in HF patients 
      without anemia. Studies designed to further unravel the pathophysiology of anemia 
      in HF are essential in order to determine 1) novel treatment targets and 2) 
      whether and how the treatment of anemia could improve outcomes.

TI  - Iron chelation by deferoxamine prevents renal interstitial fibrosis in mice with 
      unilateral ureteral obstruction.
PG  - e89355

LID - e89355
AB  - Renal fibrosis plays an important role in the onset and progression of chronic 
      kidney diseases (CKD). Although several mechanisms underlying renal fibrosis and 
      candidate drugs for its treatment have been identified, the effect of iron 
      chelator on renal fibrosis remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the 
      effect of an iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO), on renal fibrosis in mice with 
      surgically induced unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO). Mice were divided into 4 
      groups: UUO with vehicle, UUO with DFO, sham with vehicle, and sham with DFO. One 
      week after surgery, augmented renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the 
      expression of collagen I, III, and IV increased in mice with UUO; these changes 
      were suppressed by DFO treatment. Similarly, UUO-induced macrophage infiltration 
      of renal interstitial tubules was reduced in UUO mice treated with DFO. 
      UUO-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix 
      proteins was abrogated by DFO treatment. DFO inhibited the activation of the 
      transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-Smad3 pathway in UUO mice. UUO-induced 
      NADPH oxidase activity and p22(phox) expression were attenuated by DFO. In the 
      kidneys of UUO mice, divalent metal transporter 1, ferroportin, and ferritin 
      expression was higher and transferrin receptor expression was lower than in 
      sham-operated mice. Increased renal iron content was observed in UUO mice, which 
      was reduced by DFO treatment. These results suggest that iron reduction by DFO 
      prevents renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis by regulating TGF-β-Smad signaling, 
      oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses.

TI  - Maintenance of elevated versus physiological iron indices in non-anaemic patients 
      with chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 920-6
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An optimal haemoglobin (Hb) response to erythropoietin requires 
      elevated iron indices in dialysis patients; however, it is unknown if the same 
      applies in chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: One hundred patients [CKD 
      Stages 3-5, Hb >or= 110 g/L, iron replete, erythropoietin-stimulating agent 
      (ESA)-naive, 47% diabetic, median age 69.5 years] were block-randomized in an 
      open-label study to receive up to 200 mg intravenous iron sucrose (Group A, n = 
      52) bimonthly or oral iron sulphate (Group B) to maintain raised and normal iron 
      indices (respectively) over 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change in Hb 
      concentration at 12 months or at termination after at least 6 months of 
      treatment. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients reached the primary endpoint (43, Group 
      A; 42, Group B). Initial Hb was 119 +/- 7 vs 116 +/- 12 g/L (mean +/- standard 
      deviation); ferritin 122 (71-176), median (inter-quartile range), vs 90 microg/L 
      (58-150); transferrin saturation (TSat) 22 (18-26) vs 21% (15-24); and creatinine 
      240 (195-313) vs 230 micromol/L (184-352). Ferritin and TSat differed by month 2 
      [157 (103-220) vs 96 microg/L (73-162), P = 0.003] and month 6 [25 (20-31) vs 21% 
      (17-27), P = 0.02], respectively. At study end, Hb did not differ between groups 
      (121 +/- 10 vs 117 +/- 13 g/L). Ferritin was 362 (310-458) vs 125 microg/L 
      (84-190), P < 0.001; TSat 30 (23-34) vs 21% (18-24), P < 0.001; and creatinine 
      229 (188-326) vs 272 micromol/L (195-413), P = NS. For patients (Groups A and B, 
      n = 27 in each group) whose creatinine regression slope increased (indicating 
      worsening function), the fall in Hb over 12 months also did not differ between 
      groups despite adequate separation in iron indices. Serious adverse events 
      overall did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated iron indices did not 
      increase Hb synthesis in ESA-naive, iron replete, pre-dialysis patients with Hb 
      >110 g/L.

TI  - Clinical and economic outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with stage 3 or stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease and anemia: the role of intravenous iron therapy.
PG  - 605-15
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2010.16.8.605
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated 
      with increased morbidity and mortality, decreased quality of life, and 
      substantial health care costs. Iron therapy is recommended, usually in 
      combination with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), in many CKD patients 
      with anemia and low iron levels to raise hemoglobin levels to a range of 10 to 12 
      grams per deciliter; iron deficiency is defined by a ferritin score less than 100 
      micrograms (mcg) per liter and transferrin saturation (TSAT) less than 20%. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of intravenous (IV) iron and its associated 
      economic and clinical outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with stage 3 or stage 4 
      CKD and anemia. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis using 2006 and 
      2007 Medicare 5% Standard Analytic Files (SAF). Use of therapy with IV iron 
      and/or ESAs was identified among patients diagnosed with CKD and anemia. The 
      study index quarter was the first quarter in 2006 during which the patient had 
      primary or secondary diagnoses of both CKD and anemia. Based on the receipt of IV 
      iron or ESA treatment in the index quarter, patients were classified into 1 of 4 
      treatment groups: IV iron and ESA; IV iron without ESA; ESA without IV iron; 
      neither IV iron nor ESA. Therapy with oral iron was not measurable with this 
      database. Clinical and economic outcomes, including the progression to advanced 
      CKD stages, development of anemia, mortality, hospitalization, and net Medicare 
      reimbursement (i.e., not including patient or supplemental plan contribution) for 
      all-cause health care services, were examined for 1 year following the index 
      quarter. Between-group differences were tested using Pearson chi-square for 
      categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test for 
      reimbursement. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to assess 
      the associations of mortality, inpatient hospitalization, skilled nursing 
      facility (SNF) admission, and hospice care with treatment regimen, controlling 
      for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 4,310 study 
      patients with both CKD and anemia, 2,913 (67.6%) received neither IV iron nor 
      ESA; 984 (22.8%) received ESA without IV iron; 277 (6.4%) received IV iron and 
      ESA; and 136 (3.2%) received IV iron without ESA in the index quarter. Logistic 
      regression analyses showed that patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA 
      (reference group) were at increased risk of death compared with patients 
      receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.42-0.90). Additionally, 
      patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA were more likely to be hospitalized 
      compared with patients receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 
      0.50-0.87), IV iron without ESA (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38-0.79), and ESA without 
      IV iron (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.62-0.87). Further, patients not receiving IV iron 
      or ESA were more likely to be admitted to an SNF than patients receiving both IV 
      iron and ESA (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.32-0.61), IV iron without ESA (OR = 0.57, 95% 
      CI = 0.36-0.88), and ESA without IV iron (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.47-0.67). 
      Patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA in the index quarter had the highest 
      mean [SD] total Medicare reimbursement per patient in the subsequent year 
      ($42,353 [$52,887]) compared with patients receiving IV iron without ESA ($28,654 
      [$32,068]), IV iron and ESA ($34,152 [$30,506]), or ESA without IV iron ($38,172 
      [$35,591], P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use rates of IV iron and ESA in a sample of 
      Medicare enrollees with CKD and anemia in 2006 suggest that anemia management 
      therapies may be underutilized; however, oral iron therapy use was not measurable 
      with the study database, and therapies initiated after the index quarter were not 
      measured. Patients not treated with IV iron or ESA had significantly higher rates 
      of hospitalization and SNF admission than patients treated with either IV iron or 
      ESA. Further, mortality was significantly higher in patients receiving neither IV 
      iron nor ESA than in patients who received IV iron and ESA. Additionally, total 
      all-cause health care costs were higher among patients receiving neither IV iron 
      nor ESA treatment compared with patients treated with IV iron and/or ESA.

TI  - Cardiac Hepcidin Expression Associates with Injury Independent of Iron.
PG  - 368-378
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepcidin regulates systemic iron homeostasis by downregulating the 
      iron exporter ferroportin. Circulating hepcidin is mainly derived from the liver 
      but hepcidin is also produced in the heart. We studied the differential and local 
      regulation of hepcidin gene expression in response to myocardial infarction (MI) 
      and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that cardiac hepcidin gene 
      expression is induced by and regulated to severity of cardiac injury, either 
      through direct (MI) or remote (CKD) stimuli, as well as through increased local 
      iron content. METHODS: Nine weeks after subtotal nephrectomy (SNX) or sham 
      surgery (CON), rats were subjected to coronary ligation (CL) or sham surgery to 
      realize 4 groups: CON, SNX, CL and SNX + CL. In week 16, the gene expression of 
      hepcidin, iron and damage markers in cardiac and liver tissues was assessed by 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ferritin protein expression was 
      studied by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Cardiac hepcidin messenger RNA (mRNA) 
      expression was increased 2-fold in CL (p = 0.03) and 3-fold in SNX (p = 0.01). 
      Cardiac ferritin staining was not different among groups. Cardiac hepcidin mRNA 
      expression correlated with mRNA expression levels of brain natriuretic peptide (β 
      = 0.734, p < 0.001) and connective tissue growth factor (β = 0.431, p = 0.02). In 
      contrast, liver hepcidin expression was unaffected by SNX and CL alone, while it 
      had decreased 50% in SNX + CL (p < 0.05). Hepatic ferritin immunostaining was not 
      different among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate differences in hepcidin 
      regulation in liver and heart and suggest a role for injury rather than iron as 
      the driving force for cardiac hepcidin expression in renocardiac failure.

TI  - Iron repletion is associated with reduction in platelet counts in non-dialysis

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is common in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease 
      (ND-CKD) patients and, on occasion, requires parenteral iron therapy. We 
      investigated the effect of intravenous iron repletion on platelet counts in 
      ND-CKD patients with and without concomitant darbepoetin administration. METHODS: 
      We conducted a retrospective analysis of ND-CKD patients with iron deficiency 
      anemia treated with low molecular weight iron dextran (LMWID) between 2005 and 
      2009 at our CKD clinic. The primary end-point was change in platelet count 
      60 days post infusion of LMWID in those with and without concomitant darbepoetin 
      administration. Secondary end-points were the correlations between changes in 
      platelet count and iron indices. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients met inclusion 
      and exclusion criteria. The decrease in platelet counts in response to iron 
      repletion was statistically significant (305.72 ± 108.86 vs 255.58 ± 78.97, P = < 
      .0001). The decrease in platelet count was independent of concomitant darbepoetin 
      use. Bivariate regression analysis between baseline platelet count and 
      transferrin saturation by iron (TSAT) showed a negative association 
      (βTSAT = -5.82, P = .0007) and moderate correlation (R = 0.32). Following iron 
      treatment, the within individual changes in platelet count in 60 days were not 
      related to changes in TSAT (βΔTSAT = -0.41, P = .399) and demonstrated a poor 
      correlation (R = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral iron treatment by LMWID is 
      associated with reduction in platelet counts in iron deficient anemic ND-CKD 
      patients. However, ESA use in the majority of patients prior to intravenous iron 
      administration could have altered platelet production through bone marrow 
      competition.

TI  - Safety profiles of total dose infusion of low-molecular-weight iron dextran and 
      high-dose iron sucrose in renal patients.
PG  - 374-8

AB  - Iron sucrose and low-molecular-weight iron dextran (LMW-ID), two commonly used 
      iron solutions, have been compared in terms of allergic adverse event profiles to 
      date. However, the safety of total dose infusion of LMW-ID has been investigated 
      by only one study in chronic kidney disease (CKD) (not dialysis) patients. Thus, 
      we aimed to compare adverse event profiles of total and high-dose LMW-ID and iron 
      sucrose infusions in a heterogenous renal patient group comprising CKD, 
      hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. In this retrospective chart review study, 
      we included 110 predialysis CKD, 101 peritoneal dialysis, and 118 hemodialysis 
      patients. We included a total of 329 patients who were administered parenteral 
      iron sucrose or LMW-ID between September 2006 and April 2010. Adverse events were 
      determined both by medical and nursing follow-up notes. Laboratory data and 
      clinical characteristics were collected from patient charts. Adverse event rates 
      were compared between iron sucrose and LMW-ID infusions. In a total of 329 
      patients, 530 infusions (3470 ampules) were administered. We detected adverse 
      reaction in only 1 patient. This adverse reaction, which manifested as 
      generalized pruritus, occurred in a patient who received 500 mg of iron sucrose 
      infusion. There were neither anaphylactic reactions nor deaths associated with 
      infusion of either preparation. We did not observe any other adverse event 
      related to administration of 500 and 1000 mg of iron sucrose at single infusion. 
      The results of this study showed comparable safety of total dose LMW-ID and 
      high-dose iron sucrose in a heterogenous group of renal patients.

TI  - Suppression of iron-regulatory hepcidin by vitamin D.
PG  - 564-72
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2013040355 [doi]
AB  - The antibacterial protein hepcidin regulates the absorption, tissue distribution, 
      and extracellular concentration of iron by suppressing ferroportin-mediated 
      export of cellular iron. In CKD, elevated hepcidin and vitamin D deficiency are 
      associated with anemia. Therefore, we explored a possible role for vitamin D in 
      iron homeostasis. Treatment of cultured hepatocytes or monocytes with prohormone 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D or active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreased expression of 
      hepcidin mRNA by 0.5-fold, contrasting the stimulatory effect of 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D on related antibacterial proteins 
      such as cathelicidin. Promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      analyses indicated that direct transcriptional suppression of hepcidin gene 
      (HAMP) expression mediated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binding to the vitamin D 
      receptor caused the decrease in hepcidin mRNA levels. Suppression of HAMP 
      expression was associated with a concomitant increase in expression of the 
      cellular target for hepcidin, ferroportin protein, and decreased expression of 
      the intracellular iron marker ferritin. In a pilot study with healthy volunteers, 
      supplementation with a single oral dose of vitamin D (100,000 IU vitamin D2) 
      increased serum levels of 25D-hydroxyvitamin D from 27±2 ng/ml before 
      supplementation to 44±3 ng/ml after supplementation (P<0.001). This response was 
      associated with a 34% decrease in circulating levels of hepcidin within 24 hours 
      of vitamin D supplementation (P<0.05). These data show that vitamin D is a potent 
      regulator of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis in humans and highlight a potential 
      new strategy for the management of anemia in patients with low vitamin D and/or 
      CKD.

TI  - [Nephrologist's behaviours and perceptions on sideropenic anemia's diagnosis and 
      treatment for conservative phase nephropatic patient intolerant or not responding 
      to oral iron therapy].
LID - gin/30.6.3 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION. The objective of this survey was to describe the nephrologists 
      attitude on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-dialysis Chronic 
      Kidney Disease (CKD stages 3, 4 and 5), with iron deficiency anemia and no 
      response/intolerance to oral iron therapy. Furthermore, this survey describes the 
      nephrologists view about the impact of lack of anemia correction on patient 
      health, as well as the influence of organization and management of nephrological 
      centers on IV iron management. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 60 nephrologists were 
      interviewed via web by using an interactive simulation that investigates 
      nephrologists clinical and therapeutic approach on 3 different types of patients; 
      subsequently, a questionnaire was administered with in-deeper questions. RESULTS. 
      Regarding the first virtual patient, 64% of nephrologists still choose oral iron, 
      while IV iron was chosen by 16% of them. 36% opted for ESA. For the other two 
      virtual patients the most selected treatments were combinations of oral iron + 
      ESA (42% and 36%) or IV iron + ESA (21% and 38%), respectively. According to what 
      was perceived by nephrologists, issues related to IV iron are: patient discomfort 
      due to frequent hospital transfers for IV administration (50%), inadequate center 
      organization (48%), fear of damaging the venous tree (40%). CONCLUSIONS. Half of 
      the nephrologists stated they are unsatisfied with available iron therapies. 
      Difficult therapy management and restrictions of health structure were identified 
      as barriers to the prescription of IV iron therapy. A smaller number of

TI  - Efficacy of IV iron compared to oral iron for increment of haemoglobin level in 
      anemic chronic kidney disease patients on erythropoietin therapy.
PG  - 133-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anemia is the most common finding in chronic kidney disease 
      patients. Iron supplements are commonly prescribed for these patients with or 
      without erythropoietin therapy by means of oral and intravenous iron. Both oral 
      and intravenous irons have their own advantage and disadvantage, and the efficacy 
      is also different. The objective of the study is to analyze the efficacy of oral 
      and intravenous iron in chronic kidney disease patients on erythropoietin 
      therapy, an erythropoiesis stimulating agents for increment of haemoglobin. 
      METHODS: This is a prospective study comparing intravenous iron to oral iron in 
      chronic kidney disease patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis at 
      different centers and visited Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital from 
      April 2010 to April 2011. Patients having a haemoglobin level of < 11 g/dl, 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 25%, ferritin < 300ng/ml and who were on 
      erythropoietin therapy were allocated alternately into two groups to receive oral 
      iron (iron fumarate) or IV iron (iv sucrose). Haemoglobin was measured after 30 
      days of therapy. RESULTS: A significant increase in haemoglobin levels was 
      observed in both groups. But the mean haemoglobin increment was more in the IV 
      iron group than in the oral iron group. Sixty percent 60% of patients in the IV 
      iron group had an increase in the haemoglobin level of more than 1gm/dl while 
      only 20% of the oral iron group had this increase. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron 
      therapy is more effective in raising the hemoglobin level in hemodialysis 
      dependent chronic kidney disease patients.

TI  - Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus standard medical care in the treatment 
      of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease: a randomized, 
      active-controlled, multi-center study.
PG  - 953-64
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfs528 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently available intravenous (IV) iron agents vary in indication, 
      dosing regimens and safety profiles. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a stable, 
      non-dextran-containing iron formulation developed for rapid IV administration in 
      high doses with controlled delivery of iron into target tissues. The objective of 
      the present study was to evaluate the safety of FCM compared with standard 
      medical care (SMC) in dialysis (HD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients. METHODS: Adults 18-85 years of age with CKD were 
      enrolled. NDD-CKD (n = 204) patients received an undiluted IV dose of FCM (15 
      mg/kg to a maximum of 1000 mg IV) and HD-CKD (n = 50) patients received an 
      undiluted IV push of 200 mg ~30-60 min into the dialysis session. Subjects 
      randomized to the SMC group (n = 259) received treatment determined by the 
      investigator that could include oral iron, IV iron or no iron. RESULTS: Single 
      doses of FCM of 200 mg in HD-CKD patients and up to 1000 mg in NDD-CKD patients 
      were well tolerated. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar 
      between the groups: 30.3% (77 of 254) in the FCM group and 32.8% (85 of 259) in 
      the SMC group. Incidences of serious adverse events were higher in the SMC group 
      overall and in patients receiving iron sucrose or sodium ferric gluconate. There 
      were no clinically significant differences in laboratory or clinical chemistry 
      values or vital signs between the groups. There were no statistically significant 
      differences between the FCM and SMC groups in indices of hemoglobin (Hb) 
      improvement, including proportions of patients achieving a ≥ 1 g/dL increase in 
      Hb and proportions of patients achieving Hb level of >12 g/dL. CONCLUSION: FCM in 
      doses of 200 mg for HD-CKD patients and up to 1000 mg in NDD-CKD patients were 
      well tolerated and displayed comparable efficacy to other IV iron formulations.

TI  - The effects of iron on FGF23-mediated Ca-P metabolism in CKD patients.
PG  - 416-23
LID - 10.1007/s10157-012-0725-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an important counterregulatory 
      hormone for phosphate homeostasis. Since it has been reported that iron 
      administration induces hypophosphatemic osteomalacia by triggering FGF23 
      synthesis, we hypothesized that iron administration might lead to a further 
      increase in FGF23, resulting in alterations to Ca-P metabolism in a stage 5 CKD 
      population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in a single center, 
      and involved 73 hemodialysis patients (47.7 ± 15.74 years old, 68.5% men), 29 
      peritoneal dialysis patients (44.55 ± 15.05 years old, 62.1% men), and 55 healthy 
      (43.57 ± 14.36 years old, 55.6% men) subjects. The dialysis group was 
      subcategorized according to iron therapy administration into users and nonusers. 
      RESULTS: The median iFGF23 level was significantly higher in the dialysis 
      population than in the healthy controls [88.050 (25.2-1038.3) pg/ml versus 46.95 
      (2.4-356) pg/ml (p < 0.001)]. In the dialysis population, a significantly lower 
      median iFGF23 level was observed in iron therapy users than in nonusers [87.6 
      (25.2-1038.3) versus 119 (51.6-1031); respectively, p = 0.045]. A significant 
      negative association between iron administration and iFGF23 level was revealed by 
      both univariate (r = -0.237, p = 0.016) and multivariate (β = -0.221, p = 0.032) 
      analysis. No association was found between iFGF23 and serum ferritin and iron 
      levels. Also, there was no association between iron therapy and serum phosphate 
      level. CONCLUSION: In contrast to what is seen for the general population, this 
      study showed that there was a negative relationship between iron administration 
      and serum iFGF23 level in a dialysis population. We can therefore conclude that 
      if high levels of FGF23 are harmful, iron therapy may have a beneficial effect on 
      bone metabolism by reducing FGF23 levels in a dialysis population.

TI  - [Liposomial iron: a new proposal for the treatment of anaemia in chronic kidney 
      disease].
LID - gin/30.5.7 [pii]
AB  - Iron supplementation is essential for the treatment of anemia in the chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) population. Liposomial iron is a preparation of ferric 
      pyrophosphate carried within a phospholipidic membrane. Compared to other oral 
      formulations, it is well absorbed from the gut and demonstrates high 
      bioavailability together with a lower incidence of side effects. The aim of our 
      study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with liposomial iron 
      compared to intravenous iron in a CKD population with anemia and iron deficiency. 
      Our study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, fourth-phase study. 
      Enrollment for the study began in October 2011 and CKD 3, 4 and 5 patients were 
      randomized to receive either intravenous iron or liposomial iron in a 1:2 ratio. 
      The primary outcome was set as the increase of hemoglobin from baseline. The 
      secondary outcomes were the reduction of erythropoietin dosage by at least 25% in 
      patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and an increase in serum 
      ferritin of 100 ng/ml from baseline values. In the preliminary study, 21 patients 
      were analyzed, 14 of whom were treated with oral liposomial iron and 7 with 
      intravenous iron. The observed increase of hemoglobin at 8 weeks compared to 
      baseline was similar in both groups but was significant in the liposomial group 
      only.

TI  - Correction of iron deficiency anaemia using IV CosmoFer in CKD patients with 
      asthma: a prospective study.
PG  - 187-90
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcv117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) iron is commonly used for correcting iron deficiency 
      anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There remains a concern 
      for its use in patients with asthma as it may trigger an acute exacerbation. 
      Pre-treatment with a single dose of parenteral hydrocortisone may obviate this 
      risk. METHOD: We carried out a prospective study of known asthmatic patients with 
      CKD requiring single-dose iron repletion therapy. We analysed the efficacy and 
      safety of IV CosmoFer (low molecular weight iron dextran). Twenty non-dialysis 
      CKD patients with iron deficiency anaemia and a history of asthma were enrolled. 
      Severity of asthma and level of control were recorded as per British Thoracic 
      Society Guidelines and Royal Collage of Physician questionnaire, respectively. 
      All patients received IV hydrocortisone 30 min before the test dose of CosmoFer 
      followed by the remaining total dose. Patients were monitored for adverse 
      reactions. Haemoglobin, serum ferritin levels and estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate were measured pre and 6-weeks post-infusion. All patients were followed up 
      until 6 weeks to assess the control of their asthma. RESULTS: All 20 patients 
      completed the study. No patient experienced acute hypersensitivity or infusion 
      reactions. At 6 weeks follow-up, no patient reported worsening of their asthma. 
      There was an increase in mean haemoglobin from 10.1 to 11.1 g/dl and mean 
      ferritin from 93.5 to 302.6 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that IV 
      CosmoFer may be administered safely in asthmatics by administering a single 50 mg 
      dose of hydrocortisone pre-infusion.

TI  - Functional iron deficiency in patients on hemodialysis: prevalence, nutritional 
      assessment, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.
PG  - 472-480
LID - 10.1590/2175-8239-JBN-2018-0092 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be divided 
      into anemic patients without or with functional iron deficiency (FID). The 
      increase in the number of cases of hemosiderosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD) 
      attributed to excessive intravenous iron replacement has called for the 
      investigation of the factors involved in the genesis of FID. OBJECTIVES: This 
      study aimed to describe the prevalence of FID in patients with CKD on HD, 
      characterize the included individuals in terms of clinical and workup parameters, 
      and assess their nutritional, oxidative stress, and inflammation statuses. This 
      cross-sectional study assembled a convenience sample of 183 patients with CKD on 
      HD treated in Southern Brazil. Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria were divided into two groups, one with anemic subjects with FID and one 
      with anemic patients without FID. Participants answered a questionnaire probing 
      into socio-epidemiological factors, underwent anthropometric measurements, and 
      were tested for markers of anemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nutrition. 
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The date sets were treated on software package GraphPad 
      InStat version 3.1. Variables were tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, 
      chi-square, Student's t, and Mann-Whitney tests. Statistical significance was 
      attributed to differences with a p < 0.05. RESULTS: Markers of inflammation were 
      not statistically different between the two groups. Markers of anemia and 
      nutrition were significantly lower in patients with FID. Patients with FID were 
      prescribed higher doses of parenteral iron (p < 0,05). DISCUSSION: FID was 
      associated with lower nutritional marker levels, but not to increased levels of 
      markers of inflammation or oxidative stress, as reported in the literature. 
      Additional studies on the subject are needed.

TI  - Iatrogenic Iron Overload in a Patient With Chronic Kidney Disease: Is There a 
      Correlation Between Serum Ferritin and Liver Iron Concentration Determined by MRI 
      T2*?
PG  - e8914
LID - 10.7759/cureus.8914 [doi]
LID - e8914
AB  - Secondary iron overload in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to 
      iatrogenic iron replacement is an emerging medical challenge. There are limited 
      options to manage secondary iron overload in patients with CKD as most iron 
      chelators are contraindicated due to low creatinine clearance. In addition to 
      that, accuracy of serum ferritin in monitoring is questionable since it is 
      affected by different variables including inflammation and liver disease. 
      Moreover, correlation of serum ferritin with liver iron concentration (LIC) and 
      heart iron concentration is not well studied in CKD patients. There is no 
      established cut-off value in the current guidelines, and this warrants further 
      investigation with more accurate methods. There are few studies that evaluated 
      the relationship between serum ferritin and LIC determined by different MRI 
      protocols. Limited data in the literature concluded that a positive correlation 
      exists between serum ferritin and LIC determined by MRI T2* and that serum 
      ferritin more than 290 mcg/L is equivalent to severe iron overload on MRI T2*. 
      However, we had a different observation of a patient with CKD on a prolonged 
      course of iron replacement who was monitored with serum ferritin, and despite 
      having a serum ferritin level of more than 1,000 mcg/L, LIC determined by MRI T2* 
      was 5.3 mg/g of liver dry tissue, which is equivalent to mild iron overload.  
      This observation opens the door for further studies to examine the correlation 
      between serum ferritin and LIC determined by MRI and to establish a safe cut-off 
      value of serum ferritin so that further investigation would be indicated in 
      patients with CKD.

TI  - Safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron in patients with 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD: an analysis of the 1-year FIND-CKD trial.
PG  - 1530-1539
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw264 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evidence base regarding the safety of intravenous (IV) iron 
      therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is incomplete and largely 
      based on small studies of relatively short duration. METHODS: FIND-CKD 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00994318) was a 1-year, open-label, multicenter, 
      prospective study of patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD, anemia and iron 
      deficiency randomized (1:1:2) to IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting higher 
      (400-600 µg/L) or lower (100-200 µg/L) ferritin, or oral iron. A post hoc 
      analysis of adverse event rates per 100 patient-years was performed to assess the 
      safety of FCM versus oral iron over an extended period. RESULTS: The safety 
      population included 616 patients. The incidence of one or more adverse events was 
      91.0, 100.0 and 105.0 per 100 patient-years in the high ferritin FCM, low 
      ferritin FCM and oral iron groups, respectively. The incidence of adverse events 
      with a suspected relation to study drug was 15.9, 17.8 and 36.7 per 100 
      patient-years in the three groups; for serious adverse events, the incidence was 
      28.2, 27.9 and 24.3 per 100 patient-years. The incidence of cardiac disorders and 
      infections was similar between groups. At least one ferritin level ≥800 µg/L 
      occurred in 26.6% of high ferritin FCM patients, with no associated increase in 
      adverse events. No patient with ferritin ≥800 µg/L discontinued the study drug 
      due to adverse events. Estimated glomerular filtration rate remained the stable 
      in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results further support the conclusion that 
      correction of iron deficiency anemia with IV FCM is safe in patients with 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD.

TI  - The Superiority of T2*MRI Over Serum Ferritin in the Evaluation of Secondary Iron 
      Overload in a Chronic Kidney Disease Patient: A Case Report.
PG  - 665-670
LID - 10.2147/JBM.S319591 [doi]
AB  - Secondary iron overload is increasingly encountered in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) patients because of the frequent use of parenteral iron products, 
      especially in hemodialysis patients. Serum ferritin has been commonly used to 
      monitor iron overload in these patients; however, other conditions can be 
      associated with the high serum ferritin, like infections and inflammatory 
      conditions. Currently, T2*MRI of the heart and liver is the preferred 
      investigation for evaluating liver iron concentration (LIC) and cardiac iron 
      concentration, which reflect the state of iron overload. Few studies observe a 
      positive correlation between serum iron and LIC in CKD patients and postulate 
      that serum ferritin exceeding 290 mcg/L should indicate significant iron overload 
      and necessitates further MRI evaluation. However, here, we present a patient with 
      a history of ESRD for which she underwent renal transplantation twice referred to 
      our clinic due to persistent elevation in serum ferritin level (>1000 mcg/L) for 
      several years. T2*MRI of the heart and liver revealed the absence of iron 
      overload. Our objective of this case is to demonstrate the accuracy of T2*MRI 
      over serum ferritin in evaluating iron overload and questioning the positive 
      correlation between serum ferritin and LIC in CKD patients.

      target for treating anemia in CKD.

AB  - Both insufficient kidney production of erythropoietin and inflammation-mediated 
      reduction of transferrin-bound iron are major factors in anemia of chronic kidney 
      disease. Improved therapies for anemia in chronic kidney disease may involve 
      modifying regulators of erythropoiesis and iron availability. Olivari et al. show 
      in a mouse model of chronic kidney disease that transferrin receptor 2 in 
      hepatocytes, where it is required for hepcidin production, and in erythroid 
      cells, where it downregulates erythropoietin receptor activity, is a potential 
      therapeutic target.

TI  - Ferric pyrophosphate citrate for parenteral administration of maintenance iron: 
      structure, mechanism of action, clinical efficacy and safety.
PG  - 1417-1429

AB  - Anemia is a common complication in patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic 
      kidney disease (HDD-CKD). Anemia is principally the result of erythropoietin 
      deficiency, inflammation, and iron deficiency. High molecular weight iron oxide 
      nanoparticles (IONP) are routinely administered intravenously to replace iron 
      losses and, although effective, there are lingering concerns about possible 
      safety issues. Ferric pyrophosphate citrate (FPC, Triferic, Triferic AVNU 
      [Triferic and Triferic AVNU are the proprietary name for ferric pyrophosphate 
      citrate. Triferic and Triferic AVNU are registered trademarks of Rockwell medical 
      Inc.]) is a complex iron salt that donates iron directly to plasma transferrin. 
      FPC is devoid of any carbohydrate moiety and is administered via the dialysate or 
      intravenously during each hemodialysis session to replace iron and maintain 
      hemoglobin. Controlled clinical trials of up to 48 weeks in duration have 
      demonstrated the efficacy of regular administration of dialysate FPC for 
      maintaining hemoglobin levels and iron balance in HDD-CKD patients. Clinical data 
      also suggest that dialysate FPC may reduce the dose requirements for and use of 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and IONPs in HDD-CKD patients. Safety data from 
      clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance show that FPC is well tolerated 
      and not associated with an increased risk of infection, inflammation, iron 
      overload, or serious hypersensitivity reactions. FPC represents an effective and 
      well-tolerated choice for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in the 
      long-term management of HDD-CKD patients.

TI  - Prospective controlled study of androgen therapy in the anemia of chronic renal 
      disease: effects on iron kinetics.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - Ferrokinetic and RBC mass determinations were made at 3-month intervals in 
      iron-replete hemodialysis patients randomized to a control group or to nandrolone 
      decanoate therapy. After 3 months, RBC mass increased in two of 4 
      androgen-treated patients. Erythron iron turnover, an index of RBC production, 
      increased in the one responder studied but not in the two nonresponders. 
      Similarly, in a fifth subject, who was not restudied until 6 months of androgen 
      therapy were completed, an increase in RBC mass was associated with an increase 
      in erythron iron turnover. However, between 3 and 6 months, RBC mass increased in 
      all 4 androgen-treated patients studied even though erythron iron turnovers 
      remained unchanged and dialysis-associated blood losses did not decrease. Thus, 
      at least two androgen-treated patients had increases in RBC mass without ever 
      increasing their erythron iron turnover. Two of three control subjects also had 
      increased erythron iron turnovers, which in one case was related to increased 
      dialysis-associated blood losses. Changes in RBC mass were not consistently 
      paralleled by changes in Hb. These findings suggest that increases in RBC mass 
      during nandrolone decanoate therapy result from two mechanisms: increased 
      erythropoiesis (shown by simultaneous increases in RBC mass and erythron iron 
      turnover) and increased RBC survival (indirectly shown by increases in RBC mass 
      without increases in erythron iron turnover). The importance of control groups, 
      RBC mass determinations and the monitoring of dialysis-associated blood losses in 
      studying the effects of androgens on erythropoiesis in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients is also demonstrated.

      nonsurgical periodontal therapy on clinical, renal, and hematological parameters 
      at baseline and 3 months postoperatively on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. This comparative interventional study was conducted 
      among CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study 
      included chronic periodontitis (CP) patients divided into three groups Group I: 
      CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis for less than a year; Group II: CKD patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis for more than a year; and Group III: systemically healthy 
      CP patients. Clinical parameters (bleeding on probing [BOP], probing pocket depth 
      (PPD), and clinical attachment level [CAL]) were recorded at baseline (T0), 1 
      month (T1), and 3 months after scaling and root planing (SRP) (T2). C-reactive 
      protein (CRP) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were observed at T0 and at T2. 
      Paired t-test and Chi-square test were applied to find the statistical 
      significance (P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% confidence 
      interval) between the T0 and T2 time within the groups. RESULTS: Clinical 
      parameters such as PPD and CAL decreased with statistical significance in Group 
      III alone, whereas BOP decreased with statistical significance in all the three 
      groups. The study showed statistically significant reduction of CRP (in Group I 
      and Group III) and TSAT increased with statistical significance in all the three 
      groups after SRP. CONCLUSION: This suggests that SRP can bring an improvement in 
      the systemic markers in CP patients under hemodialysis. However, we need a 
      longitudinal study with a larger sample size to confirm the results.

TI  - A 3-marker index improves the identification of iron disorders in CKD anaemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron disorders are common and complex in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). We sought to determine whether a 3-marker index would improve the 
      classification of iron disorders in CKD anaemia. METHODS: We studied the 
      association between Hb level and iron indexes combining 2 or 3 of the following 
      markers: serum ferritin (<40 ng/mL), transferrin saturation (TSAT<20%) and total 
      iron binding capacity (TIBC<50 µmol/L) in 1011 outpatients with non-dialysis CKD 
      participating in the Nephrotest study. All had glomerular filtration rates 
      measured (mGFR) by (51)Cr-EDTA renal clearance; 199 also had hepcidin measures. 
      RESULTS: The TSAT-TIBC-ferritin index explained Hb variation better than indexes 
      combining TSAT-TIBC or ferritin-TSAT. It showed hypotransferrinaemia and 
      non-inflammatory functional iron deficiency (ID) to be more common than either 
      absolute or inflammatory ID: 20%, 19%, 6%, and 2%, respectively. Hb was lower in 
      all abnormal, compared with normal, iron profiles, and decreased more when mGFR 
      was below 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (interaction p<0.0001). In patients with mGFR<30 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2), the Hb decreases associated with hypotransferrinaemia, 
      non-inflammatory functional ID, and absolute ID were 0.83±0.16 g/dL, 0.51±0.18 
      and 0.89±0.29, respectively. Compared with normal iron profiles, hepcidin was 
      severely depressed in absolute ID but higher in hypotransferrinaemia. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The combined TSAT-TIBC-ferritin index identifies 
      hypotransferrinaemia and non-inflammatory functional ID as the major mechanisms 
      of iron disorders in CKD anaemia. Both disorders were associated with a greater 
      decrease in Hb when mGFR was <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Taking these iron profiles 
      into account may be useful in stratifying patients in clinical trials of CKD 
      anaemia and might improve the management of iron therapy.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial comparing intravenous ferric carboxymaltose with 
      oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia of non-dialysis-dependent 
      chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 1599-607
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia and hyporesponsiveness 
      to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in non-dialysis-dependent chronic 
      kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. Current intravenous iron agents cannot be 
      administered in a single high dose because of adverse effects. Ferric 
      carboxymaltose, a non-dextran parenteral iron preparation, can be rapidly 
      administered in high doses. METHODS: This open-label trial randomized 255 
      subjects with glomerular filtration rates ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), haemoglobin ≤ 11 
      g/dL, transferrin saturation ≤ 25%, ferritin ≤ 300 ng/mL, and stable ESA dose to 
      either intravenous ferric carboxymaltose 1000 mg over 15 min (with up to two 
      additional doses of 500 mg at 2-week intervals) or oral ferrous sulphate 325 mg 
      thrice daily for a total of 195 mg elemental iron daily for 56 days. RESULTS: In 
      the modified intent-to-treat population, the proportion of subjects achieving a 
      haemoglobin increase ≥ 1 g/dL at any time was 60.4% with ferric carboxymaltose 
      and 34.7% with oral iron (P < 0.001). At Day 42, mean increase in haemoglobin was 
      0.95 ± 1.12 vs 0.50 ± 1.23 g/dL (P = 0.005), mean increase in ferritin was 432 ± 
      189 ng/mL vs 18 ± 45 ng/mL (P < 0.001) and mean increase in transferrin 
      saturation was 13.6 ± 11.9% vs 6.1 ± 8.1% (P < 0.001). Treatment-related adverse 
      events were significantly fewer with ferric carboxymaltose than with oral iron 
      (2.7% and 26.2%, respectively; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 1000 mg 
      ferric carboxymaltose can be rapidly administered, is more effective and is 
      better tolerated than oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency in ND-CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Determination of functional iron deficiency status in haemodialysis patients in 
      central South Africa.
PG  - 352-9
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12492 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Functional iron deficiency (FID) is characterized by adequate body 
      iron stores with an inadequate rate of iron delivery for erythropoiesis. In 
      chronic kidney failure (CKD), iron availability is best assessed using the 
      percentage of hypochromic red cells (%Hypo). The aim of our study was to 
      determine the FID status of haemodialysis patients in central South Africa, using 
      the %Hypo analyte and to evaluate the ability of the currently used biochemical 
      tests, transferrin saturation (TSat) and serum ferritin to diagnose FID. METHODS: 
      For this study, 49 patients on haemodialysis were recruited. Haemoglobin (Hb), 
      mean cell volume (MCV) and %Hypo were measured on the Advia 2120i. Biochemical 
      analytes (serum ferritin, TSat) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also 
      recorded. RESULTS: Of the 49 participants, 21 (42.9%) were diagnosed with FID 
      (%Hypo >6%). A large number of patients (91.8%) were anaemic. The TSat 
      demonstrated poor sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing FID compared with 
      %Hypo. The use of %Hypo (rather than TSat) to guide intravenous iron use spared 
      16 patients the potential harmful effects thereof. CONCLUSION: Using %Hypo as a 
      single analyte to diagnose FID will lead to more appropriate use of limited 
      resources and a reduction in treatment-related complications.

TI  - Reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent: an indicator of reduced iron availability in 
      chronic kidney diseases during erythropoietin therapy.
PG  - 6-11
AB  - Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in 
      dialysis patients. Correction of anemia in CKD patients includes the 
      administration of both recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron. An 
      optimization of iron treatment requires obtaining a target hemoglobin level and 
      avoiding an excessive body-iron overload. The reticulocyte hemoglobin content 
      (CHr) has been shown to be an early indicator of iron-restricted erythropoiesis. 
      The recent European guidelines for anemia treatment in CKD assessed the value for 
      CHr >29 pg/cell as the reticulocyte parameter to evaluate a patient's iron needs. 
      The reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (RET-He), recently introduced to determine 
      the forward scatter of fluorescence-labeled reticulocytes, seems to be a 
      sensitive indicator of iron-deficiency anemia. This study evaluates the 
      concordance between the CHr parameter, used as a reference, and the new RET-He in 
      a cohort of 57 dialysis patients referred to the Nephrology Unit of our hospital. 
      All patients received erythropoietin, and iron was administered intravenously to 
      maintain the hemoglobin level between 10 and 12 mg/dL. A total of 285 
      determinations were performed with both instruments. In the dialysis population, 
      the 95% central range for CHr of 24.8 to 36.3 pg corresponds to a range for 
      RET-He of 23.3 to 40.1 pg, with a mean bias of 1.12 pg between the 2 parameters. 
      In comparison with CHr, the value of 30.5 pg for RET-He appeared to be the best 
      cut-off point with a very good sensitivity and specificity to determine patients 
      needing iron supplementation. Our study showed an excellent diagnostic efficiency 
      of RET-He to evaluate patients needing iron support and demonstrated a strict 
      correspondence between the classic CHr and the new Ret-He. This correspondence 
      was independent of clinical changes, frequently occurring in dialysis patients. 
      Both parameters could be used soon to guide and monitor iron treatment in 
      dialysis patients.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of SBR759, a novel calcium-free, iron (III)-based phosphate 
      binder, versus placebo in chronic kidney disease stage V Japanese patients on 
      maintenance renal replacement therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SBR759, an iron (III)-based oral phosphate binder, was developed for 
      the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in chronic kidney disease stage V patients 
      receiving maintenance renal replacement therapy (RRT). Serum phosphate-lowering 
      efficacy and dose response of SBR759 (3-, 6-, 9- and 12-g/day doses) were 
      compared with placebo. METHODS: Japanese patients with hyperphosphataemia (P ≥ 
      5.5 mg/dL [≥ 1.78 mmol/L]) receiving maintenance RRT (N = 63) were randomised to 
      receive either SBR759 (3-, 6-, 9-, 12-g/day dose) or placebo (12-g/day dose) for 
      4 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 72-h post-dialysis 
      serum phosphate levels at week 4 for different doses of SBR759 versus placebo. 
      Secondary endpoints were change from baseline in serum phosphate levels and 
      dose-dependent efficacy of SBR759 during the 4-week treatment period. RESULTS: 
      SBR759 showed significant reduction in serum phosphate levels compared with 
      placebo at week 4, demonstrating a significant linear dose response (P < 0.001). 
      Incidence of adverse events was comparable between the SBR759 treatment groups 
      (7/13 and 5/12 in the 3- and 12-g/day groups, respectively, and 8/13 in the 6- 
      and 9-g/day groups) and was 6/12 in the placebo group. Discoloured faeces and 
      diarrhoea were the most frequently reported adverse events. Two serious adverse 
      events were reported--one in the SBR759 3-g/day group (1/13, skin ulcer) and one 
      in the SBR759 12-g/day group (1/12, arthralgia). CONCLUSIONS: SBR759 showed 
      significant phosphate-lowering efficacy and dose-dependent response compared with 
      placebo in patients with chronic kidney disease receiving RRT.

TI  - Association between iron status markers and kidney outcome in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease.

LID - 18278
AB  - Several studies conducted in patients with various stages of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) have investigated the association of iron status markers, such as 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin, with kidney outcomes. However, 
      the associations were inconsistent and remain strongly debated. Therefore, we 
      aimed to investigate whether TSAT and serum ferritin levels were associated with 
      kidney outcome in such a population. In this study, 890 patients who were 
      admitted for the evaluation of and education for CKD were prospectively followed. 
      Primary kidney outcome was a composite of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage 
      kidney disease, or death due to kidney failure. Participants were divided into 
      quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to TSAT or serum ferritin levels. During a median 
      follow-up period of 2.8 years, kidney events occurred in 358 patients. In the 
      multivariable Cox analyses, compared with Q3 of TSAT, the hazard ratios (95% 
      confidence intervals) for Q1, Q2, and Q4 were 1.20 (0.87, 1.66), 1.38 (1.01, 
      1.87), and 1.14 (0.82, 1.59), respectively. Compared with Q2 of serum ferritin, 
      lower and higher quartiles had a significantly increased risk for kidney outcome; 
      hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for Q1, Q3, and Q4 were 1.64 (1.18, 
      2.27), 1.71 (1.24, 2.37), and 1.52 (1.10, 2.10), respectively. A Fine-Gray model 
      with death before kidney events as a competing risk showed results similar to the 
      above. In CKD, lower and higher ferritin levels were independent risk factors for 
      kidney disease progression.

AB  - Iron deficiency is commonly observed in chronic kidney disease. Blood loss and 
      iron consumption under erythropiesis activating agents (ESA) induce absolute 
      deficiency whereas defect of iron intestinal absorption and storage release 
      account for functional deficiency. High hepcidin plasma levels are probably 
      induced by inflammatory process and can explain functional deficiency. However, 
      hepcidin is negatively correlated with ESA needs and hepcidin expression is 
      influenced by other factors as degree of renal insufficiency, iron pool, 
      treatments (iron IV and ESA). IV iron is the common therapeutic approach of iron 
      deficiency and only normalized iron marrow supply cannot account for his 
      efficiency. New IV iron products allow us to conceive new therapeutic schemes. 
      Hepcidin inhibition is another therapeutic alternative.

      chronic kidney disease of stage III-IV in systemic diseases].
PG  - 30-4
AB  - AIM: To study efficacy and safety of long-term administration of epoetin and iron 
      preparations in glomerulonephritis (GN) patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) of stage III-IV in systemic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 189 
      patients at predialysis stage of CKD (glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 
      60 ml/min) were randomized into 3 groups depending on GN etiology: primary GN 
      (group 1, 123 patients), GN in systemic diseases (group 2, 45 patients), controls 
      (group 3, 21 patients). Anemia was characterized not only by red cells indices 
      but also by the level of serum ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), saturation of 
      transferrin with iron. Remodeling of the heart was determined in all the patients 
      at dopplerechocardiography estimating left ventricular myocardial mass, relative 
      thickness of its wall. RESULTS: Correction of anemia was achieved in all the 
      patients with GN and CKD of stage III-IV in systemic diseases despite the 
      activity of systemic disease (high blood level of CRP) and persistent nephritis 
      activity (high proteinuria). In many patients from groups 1 and 2 who were 
      initially diagnosed to have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of excentric type 
      LVH regressed after 6 months of anemia correction. In group 3 with untreated 
      anemia frequency of LVH increased. CONCLUSION: Treatment of anemia in GN patients 
      with CKD of stage III-IV in systemic diseases needed higher doses of epoetin and 
      parenteral iron preparations compared to patients with the above stages of CKD 
      with primary GN.

AB  - Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets(ADHR)is caused by gain-of-function 
      mutations in FGF23 that prevent its proteolytic cleavage. Fibroblast growth 
      factor 23(FGF23)is a hormone that inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and 
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D biosynthesis. Low iron status plays a role in the 
      pathophysiology of ADHR. Iron deficiency is an environmental trigger that 
      stimulates FGF23 expression and hypophosphatemia in ADHR. It was reported that 
      FGF23 elevation in patients with CKD, who are often iron deficient. In patients 
      with nondialysis-dependent CKD, treatment with ferric citrate hydrate resulted in 
      significant reductions in serum phosphate and FGF23.

TI  - Indications and associated factors for prescribing intravenous iron 
      supplementation in Swiss general practice: a retrospective observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron supplementation (IVIS) is increasing in Swiss 
      general practice. This is controversial because of higher costs and risks 
      compared with oral iron supplementation (OIS). In this study, we aimed to 
      investigate indications for OIS and IVIS in Swiss general practice and test which 
      factors are associated with prescribing IVIS instead of OIS. METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective observational study using data from electronic medical records of 
      279 Swiss general practitioners (GPs), including all their patients at their 
      first OIS and IVIS administration who were at least 14 years old and with 
      available pretreatment serum ferritin and haemoglobin measurements. We also 
      collected data about the following comorbidities: chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      stage 3b or higher, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic heart failure and 
      restless legs syndrome. Outcomes were proportions of cases treated with IVIS or 
      OIS by assumed indication (anaemic or non-anaemic iron deficiency [NAID]) or the 
      abovementioned comorbidities. We evaluated associations with IVIS prescription 
      using regression models adjusting for patient and GP variables. RESULTS: We 
      assessed 1282 IVIS and 3003 OIS cases (median age 44 and 40 years, female in 86.7 
      and 88.6%, respectively). The most important indication for both IVIS and OIS was 
      NAID (59.4 and 74.7%, respectively). Significant associations with prescribing 
      IVIS instead of OIS were the severity of iron deficiency (reflected by serum 
      ferritin levels and the presence of anaemia), the presence of advanced CKD, IBD 
      and male sex of the GP. There was a time trend towards increasing serum ferritin 
      levels associated with initiation of IVIS in NAID. CONCLUSION: When preferring 
      IVIS to OIS, Swiss GPs seem to consider severity of iron deficiency and comorbid 
      conditions. However, pretreatment serum ferritin levels in IVIS for NAID are 
      increasing, suggesting an ongoing indication extension and potential overuse.

TI  - The safety of intravenous iron sucrose use in the elderly patient.
PG  - 230-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to assess the safety and tolerability of 
      the use of intravenous (IV) iron sucrose in the therapy of iron-deficiency anemia 
      in elderly, hemodialysis dependent (HDD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
      METHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label study in a large consecutive sample 
      of 665 HDD-CKD patients (in 11 locations). Patients received IV iron sucrose 
      therapy in treatment and maintenance dosing cycles over 10-week periods. There 
      were 10 doses of 100 mg of iron sucrose in each drug cycle, and participants 
      could receive multiple cycles of either or both regimens. Variables evaluated in 
      the intent-to-treat population included adverse events (AEs), hemoglobin, and 
      iron indices. RESULTS: Of the 665 patients, 391 patients were under the age of 65 
      (younger adults) and 274 were 65 years of age or older (elder adults). Iron needs 
      and erythropoietin dosing were similar in both the elder and younger adult 
      patients. The incidence, severity, and nature of AEs and overall mortality were 
      similar in both age groups. There were no drug-related deaths or drug-related 
      serious AEs in either group. There were no hypersensitivity reactions or allergic 
      reactions in either patient population, even among those with a prior history of 
      intolerance to other parenteral-iron products. Comparison of the two age groups 
      also revealed no differences in the efficacy of iron treatment as reflected by 
      hemoglobin, transferring saturation, and ferritin response. CONCLUSIONS: There is 
      no apparent difference in the safety and efficacy of iron sucrose between elder 
      and younger adults in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in HDD patients 
      with CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite different pharmacologic properties, little is known about the 
      comparative safety of sodium ferric gluconate versus iron sucrose in hemodialysis 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using the clinical database of 
      a large dialysis provider (2004-2005) merged with administrative data from the US 
      Renal Data System. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 66,207 patients with Medicare coverage 
      who received center-based hemodialysis. PREDICTORS: Iron formulation use assessed 
      during repeated 1-month exposure periods (n=278,357). OUTCOMES: All-cause 
      mortality, infection-related hospitalizations and mortality, and 
      cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and mortality occurring during a 3-month 
      follow-up period. MEASUREMENTS: For all outcomes, we estimated 90-day risk 
      differences between the formulations using propensity score weighting of 
      Kaplan-Meier functions, which controlled for a wide range of demographic, 
      clinical, and laboratory variables. Risk differences were also estimated within 
      various clinically important subgroups. RESULTS: Ferric gluconate was 
      administered in 11.4%; iron sucrose, in 48.9%; and no iron in 39.7% of the 
      periods. Risks for most study outcomes did not differ between ferric gluconate 
      and iron sucrose; however, among patients with a hemodialysis catheter, use of 
      ferric gluconate was associated with a slightly decreased risk for both 
      infection-related death (risk difference, -0.3%; 95% CI, -0.5% to 0.0%) and 
      infection-related hospitalization (risk difference, -1.5%; 95% CI, -2.3% 
      to -0.6%). Bolus dosing was associated with an increase in infection-related 
      events among both ferric gluconate and iron sucrose users. LIMITATIONS: Residual 
      confounding and outcome measurement error. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the 2 iron 
      formulations studied exhibited similar safety profiles; however, ferric gluconate 
      was associated with a slightly decreased risk for infection-related outcomes 
      compared to iron sucrose among patients with a hemodialysis catheter. These 
      associations should be explored further using other data or study designs.

PG  - 1599-605
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2007101156 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency is an important cause of anemia in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), but intravenous iron is infrequently used among patients who are 
      not on dialysis. Ferumoxytol is a novel intravenous iron product that can be 
      administered as a rapid injection. This Phase III trial randomly assigned 304 
      patients with CKD in a 3:1 ratio to two 510-mg doses of intravenous ferumoxytol 
      within 5 +/- 3 d or 200 mg of elemental oral iron daily for 21 d. The increase in 
      hemoglobin at day 35, the primary efficacy end point, was 0.82 +/- 1.24 g/dl with 
      ferumoxytol and 0.16 +/- 1.02 g/dl with oral iron (P < 0.0001). Among patients 
      who were not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, hemoglobin increased 
      0.62 +/- 1.02 g/dl with ferumoxytol and 0.13 +/- 0.93 g/dl with oral iron. Among 
      patients who were receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, hemoglobin 
      increased 1.16 +/- 1.49 g/dl with ferumoxytol and 0.19 +/- 1.14 g/dl with oral 
      iron. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 10.6% of patients who were 
      treated with ferumoxytol and 24.0% of those who were treated with oral iron; none 
      was serious. In summary, a regimen of two doses of 510 mg of intravenous 
      ferumoxytol administered rapidly within 5 +/- 3 d was well tolerated and had the 
      intended therapeutic effect. This regimen may offer a new, efficient option to 
      treat iron deficiency anemia in patients with CKD.

      treatment with intravenous (IV) iron. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a novel IV 
      iron formulation designed to permit larger infusions compared to currently 
      available IV standards such as Venofer(R) (iron sucrose). METHODS: The primary 
      objective of REPAIR-IDA is to estimate the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of 
      FCM (two doses at 15 mg/kg to a maximum of 750 mg per dose) compared to 
      Venofer(R) (1000 mg administered as five infusions of 200 mg) in subjects who 
      have IDA and NDD-CKD. REPAIR-IDA is a multi-centre, randomized, 
      active-controlled, open-label study. Eligible patients must have haemoglobin 
      (Hgb) < or = 11.5 g/dL and CKD defined as (1) GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) on two 
      occasions or (2) GFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and either evidence of renal injury by 
      urinalysis or elevated Framingham cardiovascular risk score. Two thousand and 
      five hundred patients will be randomized to FCM or Venofer(R) in a 1:1 ratio. The 
      primary efficacy endpoint is mean change in Hgb from baseline to the highest 
      observed Hgb between baseline and Day 56. The primary safety endpoint is the 
      proportion of subjects experiencing at least one of the following events: death 
      due to any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, unstable 
      angina requiring hospitalization, congestive heart failure requiring 
      hospitalization or medical intervention, arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension 
      during the 120 days following randomization. CONCLUSION: REPAIR-IDA will assess 
      the efficacy and safety of two 750-mg infusions of FCM compared to an 
      FDA-approved IV iron regimen in patients with NDD-CKD at increased risk for 
      cardiovascular disease.

TI  - The iron-based phosphate binder PA21 has potent phosphate binding capacity and 
      minimal iron release across a physiological pH range in vitro.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - AIMS: Hyperphosphatemia in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) necessitates the 
      use of phosphate binders. This in vitro study assessed phosphate binding and Fe 
      release properties of the novel iron-based phosphate binder PA21. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Phosphate adsorption and Fe release were assessed under conditions 
      simulating administration of PA21 on an empty stomach and full stomach across a 
      pH range to which PA21 would be exposed during passage through the 
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract. RESULTS: PA21 showed a robust phosphate binding 
      capacity over the entire physiologically relevant pH range. The high binding 
      capacity at low pH indicates that phosphate binding could begin in the stomach. 
      Under the current experimental setting, the maximal bound phosphate to Fe ratio 
      was 0.47 mmol P/mmol Fe. The largest amount of Fe release was observed at the 
      lowest pH without phosphate and was much lower in the presence of phosphate. 
      These results are in line with the formation of iron phosphate at low pH, as 
      indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermodynamic calculations. Fe 
      release was minimal (≤ 0.35%) across pH 2.5 - 8.5. CONCLUSIONS: These studies 
      demonstrate that PA21 has potent phosphate binding capacity and low iron release 
      over a physiologically relevant pH range in the GI tract. These features indicate 
      PA21 could be an effective alternative phosphate binder for CKD patients.

AB  - RATIONALE: Intravenous iron is commonly use in anemia related to chronic kidney 
      disease. Skin staining due to iron extravasation is a rare adverse reaction that 
      can leave a long-term staining of the skin. PRESENTING CONCERNS OF THE PATIENTS: 
      During iron derisomaltose infusion, patient reported iron extravasation. Five 
      months after the incident, the skin stain related to the extravasation was still 
      present. DIAGNOSIS: A case of skin staining due to iron derisomaltose 
      extravasation was diagnosed. INTERVENTIONS/OUTCOMES: She was reviewed by 
      dermatology and laser therapy was offered. TEACHING POINTS: Patients and 
      clinicians need to be aware of this complication, and protocol needs to be put in 
      place to minimize extravasation and its complication.

TI  - Development of a novel immunoassay for the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin.
PG  - 150-7
AB  - To date there have been few published immunoassays for the important iron 
      regulator hepcidin. This study describes a novel competitive radioimmunoassay 
      (RIA) for the bioactive hepcidin peptide. A rabbit anti-hepcidin polyclonal 
      antibody was produced using synthetic hepcidin radiolabelled with 125I to produce 
      a competitive RIA. Normal patient (n=47) samples were collected and assayed for 
      hepcidin to determine a reference range. Other patient groups collected were 
      ulcerative colitis (UC; n=40), iron deficiency anaemia (IDA; n=15), chronic 
      kidney disease not requiring dialysis (CKD; n=45) and chronic kidney disease 
      requiring dialysis (HCKD; n=94). Detection limit of the assay was determined as 
      0.6 ng/mL. Intra-assay precision was 5 ng/mL (7.2%) and 50 ng/mL (5.8%), 
      interassay precision was 5 ng/mL (7.6%) and 50 ng/mL (6.7%). Analytical recovery 
      was 98% (5 ng/mL), 94% (10 ng/mL) and 97% (50 ng/mL). The assay was linear up to 
      200 ng/mL. No demonstrable cross-reactivity with human insulin, glucagon I, 
      angiotensinogen I, beta-defensin 1-4, alpha-defensin-1 and plectasin was 
      observed. There was significant correlation (r=0.96, P < or = 0.0001) between the 
      hepcidin RIA and an established hepcidin SELDI-TOF-MS method. Analysis of the 
      normal human samples gave a reference range of 1.1-55 ng/mL for hepcidin. Further 
      statistical evaluation revealed a significant difference between male and female 
      hepcidin levels. There was significant correlation between hepcidin and ferritin 
      in the control group (r=0.6, P < or = 0.0001). There was also a significant 
      difference between the normal and disease groups (P < or = 0.0001). Healthy 
      volunteers (n=10) showed a diurnal increase in plasma hepcidin at 4.00 pm 
      compared to 8.00 am. A robust and optimised immunoassay for bioactive hepcidin 
      has been produced and the patient sample results obtained further validates the 
      important role of hepcidin in iron regulation, and will allow further 
      investigation of this important peptide and its role in iron homeostasis.

TI  - Patient reported outcome measures and cardiovascular outcomes following high dose 
      modern intravenous iron in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease: 
      secondary analysis of ExplorIRON-CKD.

AB  - Intravenous iron is commonly used to treat iron deficiency anemia in non-dialysis 
      chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD). There is a paucity of information on the 
      potential impact of intravenous iron on patient reported outcome measures, 
      functional status and markers of cardiovascular health. As part of the secondary 
      analysis of this double-blind exploratory randomized controlled trial focusing on 
      patients with iron deficiency (+ /- anemia) and ND-CKD (serum ferritin < 200 µg/L 
      or transferrin saturation ≤ 20% and serum ferritin 200-299 µg/L; CKD stages: 
      3a-5), 26 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ferric derisomaltose 
      or ferric carboxymaltose. Participants received 1000 mg at baseline and 
      500-1000 mg at one month to achieve iron repletion. Quality of life and fatigue 
      status were assessed using the Short-Form (36) questionnaire and the fatigue 
      severity scale. Functional status was evaluated using the Duke Activity Status 
      Index and the 1-min-sit-to-stand test. Cardiac markers such as NT-proBNP, 
      Troponin T and pulse wave velocity were monitored. Intravenous iron was 
      associated with similar improvements in most domains of the Short-Form (36) 
      questionnaire, fatigue status, and 1-min-sit-to-stand ability increased 
      significantly by the end of the trial in both groups (p < 0.001). Markers of 
      cardiac function remained stable, with no arterial stiffness impact. Longer term 
      studies are required to further evaluate the impact of intravenous iron on 
      quality of life and cardiac safety in patients with ND-CKD.

TI  - Intravenous iron therapy and risk for progressive loss of kidney function in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - c189-94
LID - 10.1159/000320707 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) iron is used in the treatment of anemia in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Several lines of evidence have brought up 
      potential concerns regarding the effect of IV iron on the kidney, specifically 
      the possibility of IV iron leading to renal injury and hastening the progression 
      of CKD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 77 patients to assess 
      the rate of change in kidney function prior to and after IV iron infusion. 
      RESULTS: Patients were followed for an average of 21.3 months (range 2-35) prior 
      and 32.8 months (range 2-58) after the single iron infusion. Sixty-one percent of 
      patients had CKD stage 3 and 30% were at CKD stage IV at the time of iron 
      infusion. Of the 77 patients, 74.1% received iron dextran and 25.9% received 
      ferric gluconate (1 g total). The average slope before and after iron infusion 
      for 1/serum creatinine versus time (months) were -0.0066 and -0.0053, 
      respectively (p = 0.12). The average slope before and after iron infusion for 
      glomerular filtration rate versus time (months) were -0.5439 and -0.2998, 
      respectively (p = 0.14). There was no difference in subgroup analysis in the rate 
      of change in renal function in those with more advanced renal function as opposed 
      to those with more preserved renal function. CONCLUSION: In this limited 
      retrospective study, IV iron dextran or ferric gluconate was not associated with 
      a change in the rate of progression of CKD.

TI  - Circulating Double-Stranded DNA in Plasma of Hemodialysis Patients and its 
      Association with Iron Stores.
PG  - 985-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by oxidative stress, 
      and most of the adverse effects of CKD are mediated by iron-catalyzed ROS 
      generation. The DNA, in particular, is more susceptible to attack by ROS than 
      other proteins and membrane lipids. Considering the evidence on the relationship 
      between CKD, iron metabolism, and DNA damage, the purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate cell-free DNA in the plasma of HD patients and its association with iron 
      status biomarkers and kidney function. METHODS: Measurements of the circulating 
      cell-free DNA in plasma, iron, ferritin, transferrin and other biochemical 
      parameters were performed in 40 chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients and 40 healthy 
      controls. Blood samples were also collected 1 hour before and 1 hour after the HD 
      session to check whether a single HD session would be able to promote an increase 
      in cell-free DNA in the plasma. RESULTS: Cell-free DNA in plasma was 
      significantly increased in HD patients in comparison with healthy controls (p = 
      0.0017), and significant correlations were observed between cell-free DNA and GFR 
      and ferritin. Our findings showed that a single HD session was not able to 
      promote an increase in cell-free DNA. It was reported that increased ferritin 
      levels and reduced GFR were associated with higher circulating cell-free DNA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The HD patients presented increased ceIl-free DNA. In addition, the 
      increase of ferritin levels and the decrease of GFR were associated with DNA 
      damage. We also observed that a single HD session was not able to promote an 
      increase in cell-free DNA.

TI  - [Which is the role of the oral iron therapies for iron deficiency anemia in 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients? Results from clinical 
      experience].
LID - 2021-vol2 [pii]
AB  - Iron deficiency afflicts about 60% of dialysis patients and about 30% of 
      non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients (ND-CKD). The role of iron deficiency in 
      determining anemia in CKD patients is so relevant that guidelines from the Kidney 
      Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) initiative recommend treating it before 
      starting with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. KDIGO guidelines suggest oral 
      iron therapy because it is commonly available and inexpensive, although it is 
      often characterized by low bioavailability and low compliance due to adverse 
      effects. A new-generation oral iron therapy is now available and seems to be 
      promising. We therefore conducted a study to determine whether an association of 
      iron sucrose, folic acid and vitamins C, B6, B12, can improve anemia in ND-CKD 
      patients, stage 3-5. Our study shows that iron sucrose is a safe and effective 
      oral iron therapy and that it is capable of correcting anemia in ND-CKD patients, 
      although it does not seem to replete low iron stores.

PG  - e01234
LID - 10.1213/XAA.0000000000001234 [doi]
AB  - Preoperative treatment of anemia with intravenous iron is inconsistent despite 
      known risks of anemia and allogeneic blood transfusions. Limited research exists 
      on the effectiveness of preoperative intravenous iron for chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) patients. We discuss a patient with severe anemia from advanced CKD, 
      endometrial cancer, and menometrorrhagia. Her hemoglobin increased more than 
      2 g/dL after erythropoietin and two 750-mg ferric carboxymaltose infusions 5 
      weeks before a total abdominal hysterectomy and avoided blood transfusions 
      perioperatively. By raising hemoglobin, preoperative intravenous iron and 
      erythropoietin reduce blood transfusions and consequent risk of future allograft 
      rejection and alloimmunization in potential transplant recipients.

TI  - An economic evaluation of intravenous versus oral iron supplementation in people 
      on haemodialysis.
PG  - 413-20
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfs487 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron supplementation can be administered either intravenously or 
      orally in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and iron deficiency anaemia, 
      but practice varies widely. The aim of this study was to estimate the health care 
      costs and benefits of parenteral iron compared with oral iron in haemodialysis 
      patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). METHODS: Using broad 
      health care funder perspective, a probabilistic Markov model was constructed to 
      compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of parenteral iron therapy versus 
      oral iron for the management of haemodialysis patients with relative iron 
      deficiency. A series of one-way, multi-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
      were conducted to assess the robustness of the model structure and the extent in 
      which the model's assumptions were sensitive to the uncertainties within the 
      input variables. RESULTS: Compared with oral iron, the incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for parenteral iron were $74,760 per life year 
      saved and $34,660 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of 
      one-way sensitivity analyses show that the ICER is most sensitive to the 
      probability of achieving haemoglobin (Hb) targets using supplemental iron with a 
      consequential decrease in the standard ESA doses and the relative increased risk 
      in all-cause mortality associated with low Hb levels (Hb < 9.0 g/dL). If the 
      willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $50,000/QALY, the proportions of 
      simulations that showed parenteral iron was cost-effective compared with oral 
      iron were over 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that there is an overall increased 
      mortality risk associated with very low Hb level (<9.0 g/dL), using parenteral 
      iron to achieve an Hb target between 9.5 and 12 g/L is cost-effective compared 
      with oral iron therapy among haemodialysis patients with relative iron 
      deficiency.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The FIND-CKD study has validated the use of ferric carboxymaltose 
      (FCM) injection with a target of ferritin level between 400 and 600ng/mL to treat 
      iron deficiency anemia in non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) 
      patients. In order to assess this strategy in clinical practice, we constituted a 
      cohort of patients within our nephrology department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Patients had CKD stages 3 to 5, hemoglobin level (Hb)<13g/dL (men) or<12g/dL 
      (women), and ferritin level (F)<100ng/mL or transferrin saturation (TSAT)<20%. 
      They were not treated by erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) for at least one 
      month, and oral iron had been poorly tolerated or ineffective. FCM first dose was 
      adjusted according to patient weight. A new infusion was possible, at least one 
      month after the first, with a half-dose if TSAT<20% but F≥200ng/mL; no perfusion 
      was performed if F≥400ng/mL. RESULTS: In all, 53 patients were included with a 
      mean Hb of 11.4g/dL and a mean TSAT of 16%. Over one year of follow-up, only 
      12 patients (22.6%) needed another treatment for anemia (blood transfusion or 
      ESA). No patient showed a significant decrease in Hb. In all, 62% of patients 
      received only one infusion of FCM. CONCLUSION: The administration of FCM IV with 
      ferritin levels in the recommended target has proven effective in correcting 
      anemia of ND-CKD patients while limiting the use of another therapeutic strategy.

TI  - Impact of individual intravenous iron preparations on the differentiation of 
      monocytes towards macrophages and dendritic cells.
PG  - 1835-1845
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of iron deficiency with intravenous (i.v.) iron is a 
      first-line strategy to improve anaemia of chronic kidney disease. Previous in 
      vitro experiments demonstrated that different i.v. iron preparations inhibit 
      differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells to monocytes, but their effect on 
      monocyte differentiation to macrophages and mature dendritic cells (mDCs) has not 
      been assessed. We investigated substance-specific effects of iron sucrose (IS), 
      sodium ferric gluconate (SFG), ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and iron isomaltoside 
      1000 (IIM) on monocytic differentiation to M1/M2 macrophages and mDCs. METHODS: 
      Via flow cytometry and microRNA (miRNA) expression analysis, we morphologically 
      and functionally characterized monocyte differentiation to M1/M2 macrophages and 
      mDCs after monocyte stimulation with IS, SFG, FCM and IIM (0.133, 0.266 and 0.533 
      mg/mL, respectively). To assess potential clinical implications, we compared 
      monocytic phagocytosis capacity in dialysis patients who received either 500 mg 
      IS or IIM. RESULTS: Phenotypically, IS and SFG dysregulated the expression of 
      macrophage (e.g. CD40, CD163) and mDC (e.g. CD1c, CD141) surface markers. 
      Functionally, IS and SFG impaired macrophage phagocytosis capacity. Phenotypic 
      and functional alterations were less pronounced with FCM, and virtually absent 
      with IIM. In miRNA expression analysis of mDCs, IS dysregulated miRNAs such as 
      miR-146b-5p and miR-155-5p, which are linked to Toll-like receptor and 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways. In vivo, IS reduced 
      monocytic phagocytosis capacity within 1 h after infusion, while IIM did not. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that less stable i.v. iron preparations 
      specifically affect monocyte differentiation towards macrophages and mDCs.

TI  - A randomized, controlled trial comparing IV iron sucrose to oral iron in anemic 
      patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD.
PG  - 2846-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although iron deficiency frequently complicates anemia in patients 
      with nondialysis-dependent CKD (ND-CKD), the comparative treatment value of IV 
      iron infusion and oral iron supplementation has not been established. METHODS: In 
      a randomized, controlled multicenter trial, we compared the efficacy of iron 
      sucrose, given as 1 g in divided IV doses over 14 days, with that of ferrous 
      sulfate, given 325 mg orally thrice daily for 56 days in patients with ND-CKD 
      stages 3 to 5, Hb < or =11 g/dL, TSAT < or =25%, and ferritin < or =300 ng/mL. 
      Epoetin/darbepoetin therapy, if any, was not changed for eight weeks prior to or 
      during the study. RESULTS: The proportion of patients achieving the primary 
      outcome (Hb increase > or =1 g/dL) was greater in the IV iron treatment group 
      than in the oral iron treatment group (44.3% vs. 28.0%, P= 0.0344), as was the 
      mean increase in Hb by day 42 (0.7 vs. 0.4 g/dL, P= 0.0298). Compared to those in 
      the IV iron group, patients in the oral iron treatment group showed a greater 
      decline in GFR during the study (-4.40 vs. -1.45 mL/min/1.73m2, P= 0.0100). No 
      serious adverse drug events (ADE) were seen in patients administered IV iron 
      sucrose as 200 mg IV over two to five minutes, but drug-related hypotension, 
      including one event considered serious, occurred in two females weighing less 
      than 65 kg after 500 mg doses were given over four hours. CONCLUSION: IV iron 
      administration using 1000 mg iron sucrose in divided doses is superior to oral 
      iron therapy in the management of ND-CKD patients with anemia and low iron 
      indices.

TI  - High-phosphate induced vascular calcification is reduced by iron citrate through 
      inhibition of extracellular matrix osteo-chondrogenic shift in VSMCs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High serum phosphate (Pi) levels strongly associate with 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 
      with vascular calcification playing a major role in the pathogenesis of related 
      cardiovascular disease. High-Pi challenged vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 
      undergo simil-osteoblastic transformation and actively deposit calcium-phosphate 
      crystals. Iron-based Pi-binders are used to treat hyperphosphatemia in CKD 
      patients. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the direct effect of iron 
      citrate on extracellular matrix (ECM) modification induced by high-Pi, following 
      either prophylactic or therapeutic approach. RESULTS: Iron prophylactically 
      prevents and therapeutically blocks high-Pi induced calcification. Masson's 
      staining highlights the changes of muscular ECM that after high-Pi stimulation 
      becomes fibrotic and which modifications are prevented or partially reverted by 
      iron. Interestingly, iron preserves glycogen granules and either prevents or 
      partially reverts the formation of non-glycogen granules induced by high-Pi. In 
      parallel, iron addition is able to either prevent or block the high-Pi induced 
      acid mucin deposition. Iron inhibited calcification also by preventing exosome 
      osteo-chondrogenic shift by reducing phosphate load (0,61 ± 0.04vs0,45 ± 0.05, 
      PivsPi + Fe, p < 0,05, nmol Pi/mg protein) and inducing miRNA 30c 
      (0.62 ± 0.05vs3.07 ± 0.62; PivsPi + Fe, p < 0.01, relative expression). Studying 
      aortic rings, we found that iron significantly either prevents or reverts the 
      high-Pi induced collagen deposition and the elastin decrease, preserving elastin 
      structure (0.7 ± 0.1 vs 1.2 ± 0.1; Pi vs Pi + Fe, p < 0.05, elastin mRNA relative 
      expression). CONCLUSIONS: Iron directly either prevents or partially reverts the 
      high-Pi induced osteo-chondrocytic shift of ECM. The protection of muscular 
      nature of VSMC ECM may be one of the mechanisms elucidating the anti-calcific 
      effect of iron.

PG  - 53-56
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Disorders of mineral and bone metabolism in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular calcification and 
      osteoporosis. Anemia has been associated with progressive loss of kidney function 
      and increased mortality. Ferric citrate was recently developed, primarily as a 
      novel oral, non-calcium phosphate binder, which has also shown to replenish the 
      iron deficient state of the CKD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective 
      study was done on 40 pre-dialysis adult patients of CKD (stage 3-5) from a 
      tertiary care centre in North India. Patients on intravenous iron, erythropoietin 
      stimulating agents or other phosphate binders were excluded from the study. All 
      the patients were given tablet ferric citrate (each tablet containing ferric 
      citrate 1.1 gm equivalent to ferric iron 210 mg) in a dose of 3 tablets per day 
      for three months. Patients were followed up at two weekly intervals and relevant 
      investigations were done. They were divided into three groups according to their 
      CKD stages for subgroup analysis. OBSERVATIONS: After three months of therapy 
      with ferric citrate there was a significant decrease in mean serum phosphate from 
      6.55±0.70 mg/dl at baseline to 4.36±0.50 mg/dl at the end of three months 
      (p<0.001). Mean hemoglobin increased from 7.92±1.05 g/dl at baseline to 
      10.96±1.04 g/dl at the end of three months (p<0.001). Serum ferritin and serum 
      transferrin saturation increased from 278.25±110.56 ng/dl, 25.02±4.03 % at 
      baseline to 401.24±152.47 ng/dl and 29.62±3.77 % at the end of three months. The 
      mean serum vitamin D and serum iPTH levels, at baseline and at the end of 3 
      months were 14.61±10.80 ng/ml, 509.48±210.75 pg/ml and 23.65±14.00 ng/ml, 
      424.14±173.18 pg/ml respectively. The change in all these parameters were 
      significant irrespective of the CKD stages. CONCLUSION: The present study has 
      shown that ferric citrate is an effective and well tolerated phosphate binder, 
      which also significantly improves hematologic parameters in an iron deficient CKD 
      patient.

TI  - Iron deficiency, elevated erythropoietin, fibroblast growth factor 23, and 
      mortality in the general population of the Netherlands: A cohort study.
PG  - e1002818
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002818 [doi]
LID - e1002818
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging data in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients suggest that 
      iron deficiency and higher circulating levels of erythropoietin (EPO) stimulate 
      the expression and concomitant cleavage of the osteocyte-derived, 
      phosphate-regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a risk factor 
      for premature mortality. To date, clinical implications of iron deficiency and 
      high EPO levels in the general population, and the potential downstream role of 
      FGF23, are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine the associations between 
      iron deficiency and higher EPO levels with mortality, and the potential mediating 
      role of FGF23, in a cohort of community-dwelling subjects. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 
      We analyzed 6,544 community-dwelling subjects (age 53 ± 12 years; 50% males) who 
      participated in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) 
      study-a prospective population-based cohort study, of which we used the second 
      survey (2001-2003)-and follow-up was performed for a median of 8 years. We 
      measured circulating parameters of iron status, EPO levels, and plasma total 
      FGF23 levels. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. In multivariable 
      linear regression analyses, ferritin (ß = -0.43), transferrin saturation (TSAT) 
      (ß = -0.17), hepcidin (ß = -0.36), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR; ß = 0.33), 
      and EPO (ß = 0.28) were associated with FGF23 level, independent of potential 
      confounders. During median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up of 8.2 (7.7-8.8) 
      years, 379 (6%) subjects died. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, lower 
      levels of TSAT (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 standard deviation [SD], 0.84; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.95; P = 0.004) and higher levels of sTfR (HR, 
      1.15; 95% CI 1.03-1.28; P = 0.01), EPO (HR, 1.17; 95% CI 1.05-1.29; P = 0.004), 
      and FGF23 (HR, 1.20; 95% CI 1.10-1.32; P < 0.001) were each significantly 
      associated with an increased risk of death, independent of potential confounders. 
      Adjustment for FGF23 levels markedly attenuated the associations of TSAT (HR, 
      0.89; 95% CI 0.78-1.01; P = 0.06), sTfR (HR, 1.08; 95% CI 0.96-1.20; P = 0.19), 
      and EPO (HR, 1.10; 95% CI 0.99-1.22; P = 0.08) with mortality. FGF23 remained 
      associated with mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.27; P = 0.008) after 
      adjustment for TSAT, sTfR, and EPO levels. Mediation analysis indicated that 
      FGF23 explained 31% of the association between TSAT and mortality; similarly, 
      FGF23 explained 32% of the association between sTfR and mortality and 48% of the 
      association between EPO and mortality (indirect effect P < 0.05 for all 
      analyses). The main limitations of this study were the observational study design 
      and the absence of data on intact FGF23 (iFGF23), precluding us from discerning 
      whether the current results are attributable to an increase in iFGF23 or in 
      C-terminal FGF23 fragments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, we found 
      that functional iron deficiency and higher EPO levels were each associated with 
      an increased risk of death in the general population. Our findings suggest that 
      FGF23 could be involved in the association between functional iron deficiency and 
      increased EPO levels and death. Investigation of strategies aimed at correcting 
      iron deficiency and reducing FGF23 levels is warranted.

TI  - The Role of Reticulocyte Hemoglobin Content for the Diagnosis of Functional Iron 
      Deficiency in Hemodialyzed patients.
PG  - 50-54
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.08.030 [doi]
AB  - The effectiveness of reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) had been reported to 
      detect early functional iron deficiency especially among Chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) patients. CHr is more superior to classic biochemical indices in reflecting 
      transient iron-deficiency status, therefore improving diagnosis and treatment. 
      This study was conducted to determine the sensitivity of CHr in the diagnosis of 
      functional iron deficiency (FID) in hemodialyzed patients. One hundred 
      hemodialyzed patients along with 60 healthy controls were recruited and blood 
      specimens were collected. Venous blood was used for hematological and biochemical 
      investigations collected via 3 ml lavender-top tubes for hematological tests 
      including CBC, blood film, ESR and CHr, and red-top tube for biochemical tests 
      including TIBC, SF and CRP. A statistically significant decrease was noted in CHr 
      values between hemodialysis patients and the control group (24.8 ± 2.0 pg vs. 
      30.9 ± 1.3 pg, p<0.001). CHr values showed a significant correlations with RBCs, 
      Hb- hemoglobin, Hct- hematocrit level, MCV- mean corpuscular volume, MCH- mean 
      corpuscular hemoglobin, MCHC, RDW- red cell distribution width , SI-Serum Iron, 
      TIBC- Total iron binding capacity and TSAT- Transferrin saturation. The present 
      study showed that CHr in comparison to the conventional hematological and 
      biochemical markers commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency.

TI  - Suppressive effects of iron overloading on vascular calcification in uremic rats.
PG  - 135-42
LID - 10.1007/s40620-014-0046-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medial vascular calcification is a specific complication in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients although its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The 
      administration of iron (Fe), generally used for the treatment of anemia in CKD 
      patients, induces oxidative stress. Fe loading possibly affects the progress of 
      vascular calcification in uremia. We investigated the effect of Fe on vascular 
      calcification and its mechanism in uremic rats. METHOD: Thirty-two rats were 
      divided into four groups: untreated rats (controls), rats fed a standard diet 
      with Fe administration (Fe group), rats fed an adenine-enriched diet (uremic 
      group), and rats fed an adenine-enriched diet with Fe administration (uremic + Fe 
      group). Iron dextran was administered once a week for 5 weeks intraperitoneally. 
      Morphological alterations and vascular calcification-associated factors in the 
      aortic wall were evaluated. RESULTS: No aortic calcification was observed in the 
      control group although uremic rats developed severe vascular calcification. Fe 
      loading suppressed vascular calcification in the uremic groups. Expressions of 
      runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), single-strand (ss)DNA and phosphate 
      transporter (Pit)-1 were increased in the uremic rats compared to the control 
      rats. In the uremic group, Fe administration did not show any effect on ssDNA 
      expression, but reduced Runx2 and Pit-1 expressions. CONCLUSION: Fe suppressed 
      the development of vascular calcification through the prevention of Pit-1 and 
      vascular smooth muscle cell osteoblastic transdifferentiation.

TI  - The additive burden of iron deficiency in the cardiorenal-anaemia axis: scope of 
      a problem and its consequences.
PG  - 655-62
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.84 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Iron deficiency (ID), anaemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common 
      co-morbidities in chronic heart failure (CHF) and all independent predictors of 
      unfavourable outcome. The combination of anaemia and CKD in CHF has been 
      described as the cardiorenal-anaemia syndrome. However, the role of ID within 
      this complex interplay of co-existing pathologies is unclear. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We studied the clinical correlates of ID (defined as ferritin <100 µg/L 
      or 100-299 µg/L in combination with a transferrin saturation <20%, anaemia) and 
      renal dysfunction (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2) ) and their prognostic implications in an international pooled 
      cohort, comprising 1506 patients with CHF. Mean age was 64 ± 13 years, 74.2% were 
      male, and 47.3% were in NYHA functional class III. The presence of ID, anaemia, 
      CKD, or a combination of these co-morbidities was observed in 69.3% of the 
      patients. During a median (Q1-Q3) follow-up of 1.92 years (1.18-3.26 years), 440 
      patients (29.2%) died. Eight-year survival rates decreased significantly from 
      58.0% for no co-morbidities to 44.6, 33.0, and 18.4%, for one, two, or three 
      co-morbidities, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate hazard models revealed ID 
      to be the key determinant of prognosis, either individually (P = 0.04) or in 
      combination with either anaemia (P = 0.006), CKD (P = 0.03), or both (P = 0.02). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency frequently overlaps with anaemia and/or CKD in CHF. 
      The presence of ID amplifies mortality risk, either alone or in combination with 
      anaemia, CKD, or both, making it a potential viable therapeutic target.

TI  - Accelerated total dose infusion of low molecular weight iron dextran is safe and 
      efficacious in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 221-30
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcq180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low molecular weight iron dextran (LMWID) is licensed for use as a 
      total dose infusion (TDI) over 4-6 h. In order to improve patient convenience and 
      cost-effectiveness of therapy, we investigated the safety and efficacy of 
      adopting accelerated dosing regimens and compared this with a standard rate LMWID 
      infusion. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients undergoing accelerated and 
      standard rate TDI of LMWID was conducted across three centres. A total of 1904 
      doses of LMWID were administered at an accelerated rate of 1 g over 1 h 40 min. 
      This was compared with 395 patients who had standard rate infusion of 1 g LMWID 
      over 3-4 h. RESULTS: There were eight minor adverse events in patients receiving 
      accelerated dose LMWID (8/1904, 0.42%) in comparison to one adverse event in 
      patients receiving a standard regimen (1/395, 0.25%). No serious adverse events 
      occurred. Serum haemoglobin and ferritin significantly improved in both groups. 
      CONCLUSION: TDI LMWID is a safe and efficacious method of iron replacement. 
      Accelerated infusion regimen is safe and compares well with standard rate 
      infusion regimen. Furthermore, accelerated TDI of LMWID enables greater numbers 
      of patients to be treated and consequently there appear to be advantages for both 
      patient and health resources.

TI  - Ferumoxytol as an intravenous iron replacement therapy in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 386-93
LID - 10.2215/CJN.02840608 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intravenous iron is a key component of anemia 
      management for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Ferumoxytol is a unique intravenous 
      iron product that can be administered as a rapid injection in doses up to 510 mg. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a randomized, open-label, 
      controlled, multicenter Phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
      intravenous ferumoxytol compared with oral iron. Anemic patients with CKD stage 
      5D on hemodialysis and on a stable erythropoiesis-stimulating agent regimen 
      received either two injections of 510 mg of ferumoxytol within 7 d (n = 114) or 
      200 mg elemental oral iron daily for 21 d (n = 116). The primary efficacy 
      endpoint was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to day 35. Safety was closely 
      monitored. RESULTS: Ferumoxytol resulted in a mean increase in hemoglobin of 1.02 
      +/- 1.13 g/dl at day 35 compared with 0.46 +/- 1.06 g/dl with oral iron (P = 
      0.0002). Twice as many ferumoxytol-treated patients than oral iron-treated 
      patients achieved a > or =1 g/dl hemoglobin increase at day 35 (P = 0.0002). 
      There was a greater mean increase in transferrin saturation (TSAT) with 
      ferumoxytol compared with oral iron at day 35 (P < 0.0001). The larger hemoglobin 
      increase after ferumoxytol compared with oral iron at day 35 persisted after 
      adjustment for baseline hemoglobin, TSAT, and serum ferritin. Overall adverse 
      event rates were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients on 
      hemodialysis, rapid intravenous injection of 510 mg of ferumoxytol led to 
      significantly greater hemoglobin increases compared with oral iron, with 
      comparable tolerability.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose in correcting iron-deficiency 
      anemia: a review of randomized controlled trials across different indications.
PG  - 386-98
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1296303 [doi]
AB  - Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject) was effective and well tolerated in the 
      treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in nine, Phase III, randomized, 
      controlled, multicenter trials in a diverse range of indications, including 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), post-partum anemia (PPA) or 
      abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), chronic heart failure (CHF), 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those undergoing 
      hemodialysis (HD). In most trials, patients received either FCM doses of < or = 
      1000 mg, administered intravenously (i.v.) over < or = 15 min. or oral ferrous 
      sulfate (FeSulf) 325 mg (65 mg iron), three times daily (t.i.d.), or 304 mg (100 
      mg iron), twice daily (b.i.d.). In one trial, patients on HD received 200 mg i.v. 
      of either FCM or iron sucrose (ISC), two-to-three times weekly. In a pilot study 
      in patients with CHF and CKD, patients received 200 mg of FCM by push injection 
      compared with 200 mg of ISC slow injection. FCM was usually administered until 
      the patient's calculated total iron replacement dose was achieved. Treatment with 
      FCM improved indices of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb], ferritin and transferrin 
      saturation [TSAT] values). In patients on HD with IDA secondary to CKD, FCM 
      demonstrated comparable efficacy to ISC in achieving an increase in Hb. In 
      patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than 
      with FeSulf. Patients with PPA receiving FCM compared with those receiving oral 
      iron achieved an Hb rise > or = 2.0 g/dl earlier (7 days compared with 14 days; p 
      < 0.001), were more likely to achieve an Hb rise > or = 3.0 g/dl at any time 
      beginning at day 14 (86.3% compared with 60.4%; p < 0.001), and achieve an Hb > 
      12.0 g/dl at the end of the study (Day 42; 90.5% compared with 68.6%, p < 0.01). 
      Serum ferritin increased in the i.v. FCM treatment group, but not in the oral 
      iron group. Differences between groups were significant at each study interval. 
      TSAT increased significantly at every interval in both groups; however, 
      FCM-treated patients showed higher TSAT at each interval after the first week. 
      FCM improved patient quality of life to an equivalent extent to oral FeSulf in 
      patients with IBD or PPA, and to a greater extent than oral FeSulf in women with 
      AUB. FCM also improved quality of life as well as functional symptoms and 
      exercise capacity in patients with CHF. Safety data from more than 3000 patients 
      showed that FCM was well tolerated. No safety concerns have been identified in 
      breastfed infants of mothers receiving FCM. FCM is, therefore, an effective and 
      well-tolerated option in the treatment of IDA.

TI  - Therapeutic Effect of Iron Citrate in Blocking Calcium Deposition in High 
      Pi-Calcified VSMC: Role of Autophagy and Apoptosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20235925 [doi]
LID - 5925
AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the first cause of mortality is cardiovascular 
      disease induced mainly by vascular calcification (VC). Recently, iron-based 
      phosphate binders have been proposed in advanced CKD to treat hyperphosphatemia. 
      We studied the effect of iron citrate (iron) on the progression of calcification 
      in high-phosphate (Pi) calcified VSMC. Iron arrested further calcification when 
      added on days 7-15 in the presence of high Pi (1.30 ± 0.03 vs 0.61 ± 0.02; OD/mg 
      protein; day 15; Pi vs Pi + Fe, p < 0.01). We next investigated apoptosis and 
      autophagy. Adding iron to high-Pi-treated VSMC, on days 7-11, decreased apoptotic 
      cell number (17.3 ± 2.6 vs 11.6 ± 1.6; Annexin V; % positive cells; day 11; Pi vs 
      Pi + Fe; p < 0.05). The result was confirmed thorough analysis of apoptotic 
      nuclei both in VSMCs and aortic rings treated on days 7-15 (3.8 ± 0.2 vs 2.3 ± 
      0.3 and 4.0 ± 0.3 vs 2.2 ± 0.2; apoptotic nuclei; arbitrary score; day 15; Pi vs 
      Pi + Fe; VSMCs and aortic rings; p < 0.05). Studying the prosurvival axis 
      GAS6/AXL, we found that iron treatment on days 9-14 counteracted protein 
      high-Pi-stimulated down-regulation and induced its de novo synthesis. Moreover, 
      iron added on days 9-15 potentiated autophagy, as detected by an increased number 
      of autophagosomes with damaged mitochondria and an increase in autophagic flux. 
      Highlighting the effect of iron on apoptosis, we demonstrated its action in 
      blocking the H(2)O(2)-induced increase in calcification added both before high Pi 
      treatment and when the calcification was already exacerbated. In conclusion, we 
      demonstrate that iron arrests further high Pi-induced calcium deposition through 
      an anti-apoptotic action and the induction of autophagy on established calcified 
      VSMC.

TI  - Iron metabolism imbalance at the time of listing increases overall and infectious 
      mortality after liver transplantation.
PG  - 1938-1949
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v26.i16.1938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for patients with 
      liver cancer or end stage cirrhosis, but it is still associated with a 
      significant mortality. Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality 
      could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could 
      be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. 
      Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher 
      mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in 
      critically ill patients has not been considered. AIM: To assess the impact of 
      pre-transplant iron metabolism parameters on post-transplant survival. METHODS: 
      From 2001 to 2011, 553 patients who underwent LT with iron metabolism parameters 
      available at LT evaluation were included. Data were prospectively recorded at the 
      time of evaluation and at the time of LT regarding donor and recipient. Serum 
      ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) were studied as continuous and 
      categorical variable. Cox regression analysis was used to determine mortality 
      risks factors. Follow-up data were obtained from the local and national database 
      regarding causes of death. RESULTS: At the end of a 95-mo median follow-up, 196 
      patients were dead, 38 of them because of infections. In multivariate analysis, 
      overall mortality was significantly associated with TS > 75% [HR: 1.73 (1.14; 
      2.63)], SF < 100 µg/L [HR: 1.62 (1.12; 2.35)], hepatocellular carcinoma [HR: 1.58 
      (1.15; 2.26)], estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD EPI Cystatin C) [HR: 
      0.99 (0.98; 0.99)], and packed red blood cell transfusion [HR: 1.05 (1.03; 
      1.08)]. Kaplan Meier curves show that patients with low SF (< 100 µg/L) or high 
      SF (> 400 µg/L) have lower survival rates at 36 mo than patients with normal SF 
      (P = 0.008 and P = 0.016 respectively). Patients with TS higher than 75% had 
      higher mortality at 12 mo (91.4% ± 1.4% vs 84.6% ± 3.1%, P = 0.039). TS > 75% was 
      significantly associated with infection related death [HR: 3.06 (1.13; 8.23)]. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results show that iron metabolism imbalance (either deficiency or 
      overload) is associated with post-transplant overall and infectious mortality. 
      Impact of iron supplementation or depletion should be assessed in prospective 
      study.

TI  - Rapid, high-dose intravenous iron sucrose therapy in 2 Jehovah's Witness patients 
      with severe anemia, iron deficiency and chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 116-20
AB  - AIMS: Two patients with chronic kidney disease presented with severe anemia and 
      iron deficiency. Because of their religious beliefs, red blood cell transfusions 
      were not possible, and an aggressive therapeutic regimen of iron replenishment 
      was instituted. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The regimen included epoetin, folic acid 
      and high-dose intravenous iron sucrose infusions over multiple successive days 
      (total dosages of 2 and 3.5 g). RESULTS: The patients' iron stores were 
      replenished and an erythropoietic response ensued subsequent to this aggressive 
      and unique therapeutic regimen. There were no side effects observed which could 
      be attributed to iron sucrose, and both patients stabilized and were discharged 
      after 3 - 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic kidney disease who are 
      severely anemic and iron-deficient and where transfusions are not possible, an 
      aggressive regimen of multiple high-dose iron sucrose infusions may be both safe 
      and effective.

TI  - Relative Incidence of Acute Adverse Events with Ferumoxytol Compared to Other 
      Intravenous Iron Compounds: A Matched Cohort Study.
PG  - e0171098
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0171098 [doi]
LID - e0171098
AB  - Concerns persist about adverse reactions to intravenous (IV) iron. We aimed to 
      determine the relative safety of ferumoxytol compared to other IV iron compounds. 
      This retrospective cohort study with propensity-score matching for patients and 
      drug doses used the Medicare 20% random sample to identify patients (1) without 
      chronic kidney disease (non-CKD) and (2) with non-dialysis-dependent chronic 
      kidney disease (NDD-CKD) who received a first dose of IV iron in 2010-2012. 
      Exposures were ferumoxytol, iron sucrose, sodium ferric gluconate, or iron 
      dextran. Outcomes were hypersensitivity symptoms, anaphylaxis, emergency 
      department (ED) encounters, hospitalizations, and death after acute IV iron 
      exposure. In the primary analysis for reactions on the day of or following 
      exposure, there was no difference in hypersensitivity symptoms (hazard ratio 
      1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.16) or hypotension (0.83, 0.52-1.34) between 
      4289 non-CKD ferumoxytol users and an equal number of users of other compounds; 
      results were similar for 7358 NDD-CKD patients and an equal number of controls. 
      All-cause ED encounters or hospitalizations were less common in both the non-CKD 
      (0.56, 0.45-0.70) and NDD-CKD ferumoxytol-treated patients (0.83, 0.71-0.95). 
      Fewer than 10 deaths occurred in both the non-CKD and NDD-CKD ferumoxytol users 
      and in matched controls; the hazard for death did not differ significantly 
      between ferumoxytol users and controls in the non-CKD patients (2.00, 0.33-11.97) 
      or in the NDD-CKD patients (0.25, 0.04-1.52). Multiple sensitivity analyses 
      showed similar results. Ferumoxytol did not appear to be associated with more 
      adverse reactions than other compounds for the treatment of iron-deficiency 
      anemia in both non-CKD and NDD-CKD patients.

TI  - An Analytical Method for Determination of Total Iron in Pharmaceuticalgrade 
      Intravenous Iron Colloidal Complexes by Redox-Potentiometry.
PG  - 486-492
LID - 10.2174/2211738511666230507190224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron carbohydrate complexes are colloidal dispersions made up of 
      polynuclear Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide cores surrounded by a carbohydrate shell that 
      stabilizes the complex in iron colloidal formulations. The current study provides 
      an improved method that is precise, accurate, and linear for quantifying total 
      iron in most Iron Carbohydrate Colloid Drug Products. METHODS: Redox iodometry 
      with a potentiometric determination is used to evaluate total iron in intravenous 
      formulations. The visual indicator approach is more prone to fluctuations at 
      endpoint calculations. Hence, the voltage potential approach is widely accepted 
      as it is more accurate and sensitive. It tracks the actual change in activity 
      that coincides with the equivalence point that is finally considered an endpoint. 
      The principle is based on the idea that ferric iron in formulation reduces to 
      ferrous iron in the presence of the iodide, which oxidizes to iodine. The 
      released iodine is titrated using sodium thiosulfate. RESULTS: The proposed 
      method was precise, with %RSD (relative standard deviation) not more than 1. The 
      method was linear between 80% and 120%, with a linear regression of 0.999. The 
      percent recovery ranged from 98.20 to 99.98 for the concentration ranges of 
      80-120. The method's robustness was checked by various analysts using different 
      reagent grades. CONCLUSION: The proposed potentiometric determination method was 
      precise, accurate, linear, and sensitive. The method was successfully validated, 
      and the total iron content determined for commercial batches agrees with the iron 
      claim on the label. Therefore, this method can be adapted widely for total iron 
      content determination in any Intravenous formulation currently available on the 
      market. The proposed method is more accessible at the Quality Control facilities 
      on an industrial scale.

AB  - We investigated the effect of two dosing regimens of oral iron on iron status and 
      hematological parameters in patients with CKD. In this single center, open label, 
      randomized, active controlled clinical trial, stable adult patients with CKD 
      stage G3-4 with percentage transferrin saturation (%TSAT) ≤ 30% and serum 
      ferritin ≤ 500 ng/ml were eligible. Participants were randomized to receive 
      either 100 mg of ferrous ascorbate once daily (OD group) or 100 mg of ferrous 
      ascorbate twice daily (BD group, total daily dose 200 mg). The primary outcome 
      was change in %TSAT between groups over 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes were 
      changes in other iron status and hematological parameters, serum interleukin-6 
      (IL-6) and hepcidin. 80 participants were enrolled out of which 76 completed the 
      study. Change in %TSAT was not significantly different between groups 
      (β = - 1.43, 95% CI - 3.99 to 1.12, BD group as reference). The rise in serum 
      ferritin was less in the OD group as compared to BD group (β = - 0.36, 95% CI 
      - 0.61 to - 0.10) whereas MCHC increased in the OD group as compared to decrease 
      in the BD group (β = 0.37, 95% CI 0.067-0.67). These observations need 
      exploration to ascertain the impact of different oral iron dosing strategies in 
      CKD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Low hemoglobin density (LHD%) is a new parameter provided by 
      Beckman-Coulter derived from the mean cell hemoglobin concentration, using the 
      mathematical sigmoid transformation LHD% = 100×√(1-(1/(1 + e(1.8(30-MCHC)))). 
      This study investigated the reliability of LHD% for the assessment of iron status 
      in the presence of inflammation. METHODS: Healthy subjects (n = 90) and patients 
      with iron deficiency (IDA, n = 110), chronic kidney disease (CKD, n = 65) and 
      anemia of chronic disease (ACD, n = 85; 24 were iron deficient and 61 were iron 
      sufficient) were analyzed on a LH 780 analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Miami, FL, 
      USA). Independent samples U test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve analysis were applied. To determine the concordance between LHD% and 
      soluble transferrin receptor (sTrR) Cohen's κ index was calculated. RESULTS: LHD 
      % values showed no statistical difference in patients with IDA and patients with 
      ACD accompanied with IDA (P = 0.6427); LHD% values in these patients were 
      significantly different (P < 0.0001) compared with the iron-sufficient patients 
      with ACD. ROC analysis for LHD% in the detection of iron deficiency showed the 
      following: area under curve 0.903; cut off 5.5%, sensitivity 88.6%, specificity 
      76.9%; κ index, 0.65. CONCLUSION: LHD% is a reliable parameter for the detection 
      of iron deficiency in patients with anemia in the presence of inflammation.

TI  - Synbiotic supplement for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in haemodialysis 
      patients: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 234-239
LID - 10.1111/nep.14149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that probiotics can increase the availability of 
      iron. The aim of current study was to determine the effects of synbiotic 
      supplementation on the haematological parameters and anaemia in haemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      trial. Fifty patients were randomly selected from the haemodialysis section of 
      Vaseii Hospital, Sabzevar, Iran. Subjects in the symbiotic and control groups 
      received 2 capsules of synbiotic supplement or placebo, respectively, once a day 
      for 8 weeks. Blood samples were divided into two test tubes in equal volumes. 
      Blood haemoglobin, haematocrit, transferrin saturation, red blood cells (RBCs), 
      and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were measured with auto-analyser. Ferritin 
      was determined using Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: 
      Twenty tree patients in each group completed the study. Significant results were 
      recorded in synbiotic groups regarding the concentration of blood haemoglobin, 
      haematocrit, transferrin saturation, the number of RBCs, and serum ferritin 
      compare to placebo group (P < .05). At the end of week 8, TIBC significantly 
      decreased in synbiotic than placebo group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Synbiotic 
      supplementation could be a safe and promising candidate in improving anaemia in 
      CKD patients.

AB  - Population-based study demonstrated that iron deficiency is really frequent, and 
      anaemia not rare. Nevertheless, iron deficiency afflicts anaemic patients at all 
      stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Bioavailability of oral iron supplements 
      is highly variable, particularly in case of CKD. Moreover, efficacy is in favour 
      of intravenous (i.v.) iron over oral iron. And safety of i.v. iron sucrose is 
      today definite. Finally, recommended targets, i.e. Hb > 11 g/dl and transferring 
      saturation > 20%, necessitate i.v. iron.

TI  - Effects of carnitine on oxidative stress response to intravenous iron 
      administration to patients with CKD: impact of haptoglobin phenotype.
PG  - 135
LID - 10.1186/s12882-015-0119-0 [doi]
LID - 135
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common disorder in CKD patients. It is largely attributed 
      to decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production and iron deficiency. Therefore, 
      besides EPO, therapy includes iron replenishment. However, the latter induces 
      oxidative stress. Haptoglobin (Hp) protein is the main line of defense against 
      the oxidative effects of Hemoglobin/Iron. There are 3 genotypes: 1-1, 2-1 and 
      2-2. Hp 2-2 protein is inferior to Hp 1-1 as antioxidant. So far, there is no 
      evidence whether haptoglobin phenotype affects iron-induced oxidative stress in 
      CKD patients. Therefore, the present study examines the influence of carnitine 
      treatment on the intravenous iron administration (IVIR)-induced oxidative stress 
      in CKD patients, and whether Hp phenotype affects this response. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN5700858. This study included 26 
      anemic (Hb = 10.23 ± 0.28) CKD patients (stages 3-4) that were given a weekly 
      IVIR (Sodium ferric gluconate, [125 mg/100 ml] for 8 weeks, and during weeks 5-8 
      also received Carnitine (20 mg/kg, IV) prior to IVIR. Weekly blood samples were 
      drawn before and after each IVIR for Hp phenotype, C-reactive protein (CRP), 
      advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP), neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
      lipocalin (NGAL), besides complete blood count and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: 
      Eight percent of CKD patients were Hp1-1, 19 % Hp2-1, and 73 % Hp2-2. IVIR for 4 
      weeks did not increase hemoglobin levels, yet worsened the oxidative burden as 
      was evident by elevated plasma levels of AOPP. The highest increase in AOPP was 
      observed in Hp2-2 patients. Simultaneous administration of Carnitine with IVIR 
      abolished the IVIR-induced oxidative stress as evident by preventing the 
      elevations in AOPP and NGAL, preferentially in patients with Hp2-2 phenotype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Hp2-2 is a significant risk factor for 
      IVIR-induced oxidative stress in CKD patients. Our finding, that 
      co-administration of Carnitine with IVIR preferentially attenuates the adverse 
      consequences of IVIR, suggests a role for Carnitine therapy in these patients.

TI  - [Treatment of iron deficiency in predialysis state by low molecular weight iron 
      dextran high doses intravenously].
PG  - 41-6
LID - 10.1016/j.nephro.2011.04.005 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in predialysis 
      stage. Iron deficiency is more common than in normal patients and plays a key 
      role in the genesis of anemia. Its correction avoids the use of erythropoiesis 
      stimulating agents (ESA) or reduces their dosage. Treatment with oral iron is 
      often poorly tolerated and ineffective, necessitating the use of intravenous 
      iron. New forms of injectable iron allow the use of high doses and correct iron 
      deficiency in a single administration with consequent preservation of venous 
      capital and lower costs. We studied the effectiveness of iron dextran of low 
      molecular weight (LMWID) in high doses to correct iron deficiency and treat 
      anemia in predialysis CKD patients. Twenty-nine doses of 500 to 1600 mg were 
      administered to 25 patients followed for CKD (GFR between 60 and 10 ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2)), selected on biological criteria of iron deficiency defined by a ratio 
      of transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20% and/or serum ferritin of less than 100 
      μg/L. Patients received treatment by ESA in 16 cases out of 29. One month after 
      treatment, hemoglobin (Hb) increased significantly (11.4±1.6 vs 10.4±1.4 g/dL, 
      P=0.0003) along with a significant increase in TSAT (21.3±7.3 vs 13.3±3.8%, 
      P=0.000003) and serum ferritin (286±253 vs 91±60 μg/L, P=0.00005). Six patients 
      had a serum ferritin greater than 500 μg/L after treatment, which may put them at 
      risk of iron overload. Their serum ferritin was higher than the rest of the 
      population before treatment, while the TSAT was no different, reflecting a 
      functional deficiency. Their hemoglobin did not increase after treatment in 
      contrast to the rest of the population suggesting the unavailability of iron for 
      erythropoiesis with accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system. Renal 
      function did not change significantly and there were no cases of acute renal 
      failure. No immediate side effect was observed. Three patients presented delayed 
      reactions to such self-limiting myalgia and arthralgia. No venous inflammatory 
      reaction was noted. The administration of high doses of LMWID is effective in 
      treating anemia of CKD in the predialysis stage with a satisfactory tolerance, 
      without affecting kidney function and helps preserve the venous capital. It 
      should be reserved for patients whose serum ferritin is less than or equal to 150 
      μg/L.

TI  - [Recommendations of iron management in chronic kidney patients].
PG  - S356-62
AB  - The national and international recommendations concerning the iron management in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient are well established. All acknowledge the 
      fact that iron needs are increased in uremic patients. This is particularly true 
      for CKD-5 patients treated by hemodialysis (increased losses) and when treated by 
      an erythropoetic stimulating agent (ESA). Annual iron requirements are currently 
      estimated between 500 mg and 3000 mg per year. The biodisponibility of oral iron 
      isreduced and side effects are quite common. The venous supplementation of iron 
      offers today the best safety/efficacy profile. The evaluation of iron store is 
      mandatory in CKD patient. The assessment of iron store in kidney patient relies 
      on three major markers: transferrin saturation (Trf Sat); ferritin; percentage of 
      hypochromic erythroid cells. Faced to iron deficiency, it is crucial to 
      differentiate two situations: an absolute iron deficiency (Trf Sat < 20 % ; 
      ferritin < 100 ng/ml; percentage of hypochromic cells > 10%); a functional iron 
      deficiency (Trf Sat < 20%; ferritin > 200-500 ng/ml; percentage of hypochromic 
      cells > 5-10%). When intravenous iron supplementation is indicated, dosing regime 
      should be based on a slow and a reduced dosage administration to comply with 
      manufacturer and best practice recommendations. Regular iron infusion of 50 to 
      100 mg per week is able to cover the basic needs for most hemodialysis patients.

TI  - [Searching for additional markers of impaired iron metabolism in diabetes 
      mellitus].
PG  - 61-70
LID - 10.14341/probl12277 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is known that metabolic disorders in diabetes mellitus have a 
      regulating effect on ferrokinetics, and therefore diabetes mellitus is often 
      accompanied by various disorders of iron metabolism, both anemia and secondary 
      iron overload. The main problem is timely and accurate differential diagnosis 
      between anemia of chronic diseases and iron deficiency anemia. It is necessary to 
      establish reliable laboratory markers of anemia of chronic diseases in order to 
      solve this problem, as well as to understand what metabolic disorders can lead to 
      the occurrence and aggravate the course of this type of anemia. AIMS: To study 
      the frequency of occurrence of violations of ferrokinetics in patients with 
      diabetes mellitus, as well as to establish clinical and biochemical correlations 
      that are significant in the differential diagnosis of various disorders of iron 
      metabolism: iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic diseases and dysmetabolic 
      iron overload syndrome in diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research 
      design a single-stage observational single-center research. The research was 
      conducted on the basis of the endocrinological clinic of the Federal State 
      Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education Siberian State Medical 
      University in Tomsk. The research included 76 patients with type 1 and type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. We conducted an assessment of all patients as follows: 
      anthropometric data assessment; glycated hemoglobin study; creatinine level study 
      with the calculation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the CKD-EPI 
      formula. We also evaluated the number of erythrocytes, reticulocytes, the 
      hemoglobin concentration, haematocrit level and biochemical parameters of iron 
      metabolism: serum iron and ferritin concentrations; the concentration of hepsidin 
      and non-specific markers of inflammation: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 
      and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: 20 people (26.3%) of the 
      76 patients included in the study, had type 1 diabetes mellitus and 56 people 
      (73.3%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The parameters of ferrokinetics did not 
      significantly differ in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while 
      in the group of patients with 20 patients (26.3%) from the 76 ones included into 
      the research had type 1 diabetes mellitus and 56 (73.3%) from them had type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. The parameters of ferrokinetics did not significantly differ 
      in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while in the group of 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the levels of CRP (p=0.034) and blood 
      leukocytes (p=0.020) were significantly higher than in patients with type 1 
      diabetes mellitus. Both in the main group of patients with impaired carbohydrate 
      metabolism, and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, anemia of chronic 
      diseases prevailed in the structure of the anemia syndrome. After dividing the 
      main group of patients into groups by type of anemia syndrome: absence of anemia, 
      anemia of chronic diseases and iron deficiency anemia, a comparative analysis of 
      the average values of markers of inflammation and the level of hepsidin in these 
      groups was performed. It was found that in patients with anemia of chronic 
      diseases, the level of hepsidin is significantly higher than in patients without 
      anemic syndrome (p=0.033). Paired correlation analysis showed a positive 
      correlation of ESR with microalbuminuria (r=0.515; P&lt;0.0001), creatinine level 
      (r=0.467; P&lt;0.0001) and negative &mdash; with GFR (r= -0.436; P&lt;0.0001) and 
      iron in serum (r=-0.276; p=0.017). As the result of ROC analysis the most 
      informative in the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease were: ferritin &mdash; 
      sensitivity 78%, specificity 52% with a diagnostic threshold of 75.5 ng/ml (area 
      under the curve 0,695; p=0.006); ESR &mdash; sensitivity 67%, specificity 64% 
      with a diagnostic threshold of 15.5 mm/HR (area under the curve of 0.750 in; 
      p=0.040) and the CRP &mdash; sensitivity 67%, specificity 64% with a diagnostic 
      threshold of 5.2 ng/ml (area under the curve 0,646; р&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSION: 
      Thus, the studied markers of inflammation &mdash; ESR and CRP, as well as 
      hepsidin in combination with the classic diagnostic parameter &mdash; ferritin, 
      demonstrated high value in the diagnosis of anemia of chronic diseases and can be 
      included in the modified algorithm for differential diagnosis of anemia syndrome 
      in patients with diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Individualized use of iron therapy (IT) and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents 
      (ESA) may effectively correct anemia and its symptoms in CKD patients (Pts). The 
      aim of this retrospective study was to precise the anemia management (AM) in 
      incident HD Pts, and to compare Pts treated by intravenous (i.v.) IT and ESA 
      during predialysis to those treated by oral IT and ESA on AM and cardiovascular 
      parameters during the first year of HD. One hundred and two Pts performed their 
      first dialysis in the unit, mean age 58.5 (15.9) years, 70% males, 27% diabetes. 
      Ninety Pts started with a native arteriovenous fistula. Charlson comorbidity 
      index was 7.3 (3.5). Mortality rate was 3% at one year. Hb level was at start 
      10.6 (1.7) and at one year 11.7 (1.1) g/dL (P<0.0001). DA injected every 2weeks 
      was at the beginning at 107 (56) μg and then at 61 (46) (P<0.0001). i.v. IT 
      injected every week was at the dosage of 87 (23) mg and then at 57 (40mg) per 
      injection (P<0.001). Out of 102 Pts, 33 received i.v. IT during predialysis. 
      These Pts started dialysis with a better Hb level: 11.1 (1.3) versus 10.4 (1.55) 
      g/dL (P<0.01), had a TSAT at 50.0 (19.2) versus 30.1 (15.2) % (P<0.001), received 
      less ESA 0.58 (0.28) versus 0.82 (0.37) μg/kg per week (P<0.01). More important 
      were the changes on the cardiovascular functions: left ventricular mass at 116 
      (34) versus 134 (39) g/m(2) (P<0.02), left ventricular ejection fraction at 64.7 
      (4.4) versus 61.4 (8.7) % (P<0.02) and mean arterial pressure at 104.7 (80) 
      versus 109 (13.2) mmHg (P<0.02). These Pts were also less hospitalized. This 
      study revealed the importance of i.v. IT during predialysis care not only on AM 
      but also on cardiovascular status in HD Pts starting dialysis.

TI  - [Effect of diet therapy on iron metabolism in chronic kidney disease].
PG  - 16-9
AB  - A modified Giordano-Giovanetti diet has a beneficial therapeutic effect in the 
      treatment of azotemia and uremia. The diet is capable of maintaining nitrogenous 
      equilibrium for a long period of time. However, the chemical composition of the 
      diet does not meet iron requirements of patients with chronic renal diseases. 
      Besides, the quantitative ratio of the ingredients such as proteins and 
      carbohydrates has an adverse effect on iron absorption, the greatest portion of 
      iron contained by the diet is bound with products of plant origin and absorbed by 
      the body to a negligible degree. It is recommended that the diet suggested be 
      supplemented with readily available iron preparations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The percentage of hypochromic red cells (% Hypo-He) is now available 
      on the Sysmex analyzer XE 5000 (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). In this study 
      the reliability of % Hypo-He in the assessment of iron status in the presence of 
      inflammation is investigated. METHODS: Ninety healthy subjects, 91 patients with 
      iron deficiency anemia (IDA) previous to therapy, 65 patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), 57 patients with anemia of chronic diseases (ACD) and 28 patients 
      with storage iron deficiency (ACD/IDA) receiving therapy were analyzed. Pearson's 
      correlation, Independent samples t-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve analysis and Cohen's k index were applied. RESULTS: % Hypo-He values 
      inversely correlated with the blood hemoglobin (Hb) (r=-0.78) and Hb content 
      (MHC, r=-0.75). In patients with IDA and ACD/IDA the values obtained for % 
      Hypo-He showed no statistical difference (p=0.5037). ROC analysis results for % 
      Hypo-He in the detection of iron deficiency defined by a serum transferrin 
      receptor (sTfR) >21 nmol/L. The area under the curve is 0.929; cut-off 3.6%, 
      sensitivity 91.5% and specificity 80.9%. Using the threshold 3.6% the k index 
      obtained in comparison to sTfR was 0.64. CONCLUSIONS: % Hypo-He is a reliable 
      parameter for the detection of iron deficiency in patients with anemia in the 
      presence of inflammation.

TI  - Erythropoietin therapy in pre-dialysis patients with chronic renal failure: lack 
      of need for parenteral iron.
PG  - 78-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: During erythropoietin therapy, scant information exists regarding the 
      optimal target percent saturation of transferrin (TSAT), ferritin and the mode 
      and amount of iron supplementation in pre-dialysis patients with anemia due to 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). HYPOTHESIS: Pre-dialysis CKD patients may have 
      different needs for iron supplementation than end-stage renal disease subjects 
      during erythropoietin therapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of pre-dialysis 
      CKD subjects (n = 31) treated with erythropoietin at our institution. RESULTS: In 
      this population our results showed that target hematocrit (33-36%) was achievable 
      with erythropoietin (mean subcutaneous dose 86 +/- 17 [SD] units/kg/week) without 
      parenteral iron therapy. The hematocrit increased from a mean baseline value of 
      28.4 +/- 2.7 to 33.6 +/- 3.4% at time 1 (4-9 weeks, p < 0.0001), and to 37.7 +/- 
      4.5% at time 2 (10-20 weeks, p < 0.0001). The hemoglobin concentration increased 
      from 9 +/- 0.9 g/dl at baseline to 10.7 +/- 1.1 g/dl at time 1 (p < 0.0001) and 
      to 12 +/- 1.5 g/dl at time 2 (p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses of patients 
      prescribed <200 mg oral elemental iron per day (n = 10), those with TSAT <20% 
      and/or ferritin <100 ng/ml (n = 19), and those prescribed erythropoietin <80 
      units/kg/week (n = 12), all showed a significant increase in hematocrit and 
      hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that pre-dialysis CKD subjects respond 
      adequately to erythropoietin at or lower than recommended erythropoietin doses 
      without parenteral iron. This response extends even to subgroups with TSAT and/or 
      ferritin levels deemed to indicate iron deficiency in CKD subjects, and may be 
      due to lack of existence of functional iron deficiency in this group of patients.

AB  - In chronic kidney diseases, NTBI can occur even when total iron levels in serum 
      are low and transferrin is not saturated. We postulated that elevated serum 
      phosphate concentrations, present in CKD patients, might disrupt Fe(3+) loading 
      into apo-transferrin by forming Fe(III)-phosphate species. We report that 
      phosphate competes with apo-transferrin for Fe(3+) by forming a soluble 
      Fe(III)-phosphate complex. Once formed, the Fe(III)-phosphate complex is not a 
      substrate for donating Fe(3+) to apo-transferrin. Phosphate (1-10mM) does not 
      chelate Fe(III) from diferric transferrin under the conditions examined. 
      Complexed forms of Fe(3+), such as iron nitrilotriacetic acid (Fe(3+)-NTA), and 
      Fe(III)-citrate are not susceptible to this phosphate complexation reaction and 
      efficiently deliver Fe(3+) to apo-transferrin in the presence of phosphate. This 
      reaction suggests that citrate might play an important role in protecting against 
      Fe(III), phosphate interactions in vivo. In contrast to the reactions of Fe(3+) 
      and phosphate, the addition of Fe(2+) to a solution of apo-transferrin and 
      phosphate lead to rapid oxidation and deposition of Fe(3+) into apo-transferrin. 
      These in vitro data suggest that, in principle, elevated phosphate concentrations 
      can influence the ability of apo-transferrin to bind iron, depending on the 
      oxidation state of the iron.

TI  - The future of intravenous iron in nephrology.
PG  - i6-i9
AB  - Management of anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients can be difficult 
      and expensive. The recently completed Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with 
      Aranesp Therapy (TREAT), the largest double-blinded trial of 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) treatment in CKD to date, provides us 
      with a wealth of new information on the natural history of anaemia in Stage 3 and 
      4 CKD and the risks and benefits of use of ESAs. This section will discuss some 
      of the TREAT trial results in the context of other recent studies of ESAs and 
      intravenous iron in CKD patients. It will also review applying those results when 
      choosing anaemia goals for an individual, and determining if iron therapy might 
      improve anaemia.

TI  - Beyond efficacy and safety-the need for convenient and cost-effective iron 
      therapy in health care.
PG  - i14-i19
AB  - The National Service Framework advocates correction of anaemia in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral iron is insufficient, while intravenous (IV) 
      supplementation replenishes and maintains iron stores. Previously, effective 
      delivery of iron therapy using available parenteral preparations has been 
      hampered by dosing schedules and the need in some cases of a test dose. The 
      introduction in Europe of newer iron preparations, including iron isomaltoside 
      1000 (Monofer) and iron carboxymaltose (Ferinject), now offers a potentially 
      safe, effective and time-efficient method of outpatient iron repletion. This may 
      potentially lead to better cost-effectiveness in a resource-limited service.

TI  - Iron-based phosphate binders: do they offer advantages over currently available 
      phosphate binders?
PG  - 161-7
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfu139 [doi]
AB  - Increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been associated with the 
      hyperphosphatemia seen in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      Oral phosphate binders are prescribed in these patients to prevent intestinal 
      absorption of dietary phosphate and reduce serum phosphate. In prospective 
      observational cohorts they have shown to decrease all-cause and cardiovascular 
      mortality risk. Different problems have been associated with currently available 
      phosphate binders as positive calcium balance and impaired outcomes with 
      calcium-based phosphate binders or increased costs with non-calcium-based 
      phosphate binders. Iron-based phosphate binders represent a new class of 
      phosphate binders. Several iron-based phosphate binders have undergone testing in 
      clinical trials. Ferric citrate (JTT-751) and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21) are 
      the two iron-based binders that have passed to the clinical field after being 
      found safe and effective in decreasing serum phosphate. Iron from ferric citrate 
      is partially absorbed compared to sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Ferric citrate usage 
      could result in an important reduction in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) 
      and IV iron usage, resulting in significant cost savings. Sucroferric 
      oxyhydroxide was effective in lowering serum phosphorus in dialysis patients with 
      similar efficacy to sevelamer carbonate, but with lower pill burden, and better 
      adherence. Ferric citrate may be more suited for the treatment of chronic 
      hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients requiring iron supplements but its use may have 
      been hampered by potential aluminum overload, as citrate facilitates its 
      absorption; sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be more suited for hyperphosphatemic CKD 
      patients not requiring iron supplementation, with low pill burden.

TI  - Route of intestinal absorption and tissue distribution of iron contained in the 
      novel phosphate binder ferric citrate.
PG  - 1136-1144
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfaa053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is, in part, caused by 
      hepcidin-mediated impaired iron absorption. However, phosphate binder, ferric 
      citrate (FC) overcomes the CKD-induced impairment of iron absorption and 
      increases serum iron, transferrin saturation, and iron stores and reduces 
      erythropoietin requirements in CKD/ESRD patients. The mechanism and sites of 
      intestinal absorption of iron contained in FC were explored here. METHODS: 
      Eight-week old rats were randomized to sham-operated or 5/6 nephrectomized (CKD) 
      groups and fed either regular rat chow or rat chow containing 4% FC for 6 weeks. 
      They were then euthanized, and tissues were processed for histological and 
      biochemical analysis using Prussian blue staining, Western blot analysis to 
      quantify intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins and real-time PCR to 
      measure Fatty Acid receptors 2 (FFA2) and 3 (FFA3) expressions. RESULTS: CKD rats 
      exhibited hypertension, anemia, azotemia, and hyperphosphatemia. FC-treated CKD 
      rats showed significant reductions in blood pressure, serum urea, phosphate and 
      creatinine levels and higher serum iron and blood hemoglobin levels. This was 
      associated with marked increase in iron content of the epithelial and 
      subepithelial wall of the descending colon and modest iron deposits in the 
      proximal tubular epithelial cells of their remnant kidneys. No significant 
      difference was found in hepatic tissue iron content between untreated and 
      FC-treated CKD or control groups. Distal colon's epithelial tight Junction 
      proteins, Occludin, JAM-1 and ZO-1 were markedly reduced in the CKD groups. The 
      FFA2 expression in the jejunum and FFA3 expression in the distal colon were 
      significantly reduced in the CKD rats and markedly increased with FC 
      administration. CONCLUSION: Iron contained in the phosphate binder, FC, is 
      absorbed by the distal colon of the CKD animals via disrupted colonic epithelial 
      barrier and upregulation of short chain fatty acid transporters.

TI  - Monitoring iron status in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis.
PG  - 73-8
AB  - Body iron stores should be assessed regularly and accurately during 
      erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) replacement therapy. To evaluate the accuracy of the 
      current tests, transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin levels, in 
      assessing and monitoring body iron stores, we studied 24 regular hemodialysis 
      patients (19 males, mean age 47+/-18 years, and mean duration on hemodialysis 
      15+/-13 months) on regular erythropoietin therapy over a 12 month period. 
      Patients were classified as having normal, deficient, indeterminate, or overload 
      status depending on the values of TSAT and serum ferritin. Using TSAT and serum 
      ferritin, iron status could be determined in 16 (67%) patients only; 12 (50%) had 
      adequate (or normal) iron status, 3 (12.5%) had iron deficiency, and one (4.2%) 
      had iron overload. In the remaining 8 patients, iron status was indeterminate; 
      six patients had high serum ferritin with low TSAT (functional iron deficiency), 
      and two patients had high TSAT values and low serum ferritin. Serum ferritin 
      alone had very low specificity in diagnosing iron overload. In conclusion, when 
      used together, TSAT and serum ferritin have a low sensitivity for diagnosing the 
      iron status of CKD patients on HD. When TSAT and serum ferritin values diverge, 
      they become unreliable in guiding iron therapy, and this set of findings 
      generally indicates functional iron deficiency. There is a clear need to use the 
      newer indices, like reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration and percentage of 
      hypochromic red cells, which are more sensitive. This is likely to make the 
      diagnosis of iron status more accurate and may reduce the requirements and 
      frequency of iron and r-HuEPO administration.

TI  - Theranostic Role of Iron Oxide Nanoparticle for Treating Renal Anemia: Evidence

LID - 1714
AB  - (1) Background: Increasing attention has been given to applying nanosized iron 
      oxide nanoparticles (IOPs) to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients who suffer from IDA often need long-term iron supplements. 
      We aim to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effect of MPB-1523, a novel IOPs, 
      in anemic CKD mice and to monitor iron storage by magnetic resonance (MR) 
      imaging. (2) Methods: MPB-1523 was intraperitoneally delivered to the CKD and 
      sham mice, and blood were collected for hematocrit, iron storage, cytokine 
      assays, and MR imaging throughout the study. (3) Results: The hematocrit levels 
      of CKD and sham mice dropped initially but increased gradually to reach a steady 
      value 60 days after IOP injection. The body iron storage indicator, ferritin 
      gradually rose and total iron-binding capacity stabilized 30 days after IOP 
      injection. No significant inflammation or oxidative stress were observed in both 
      groups. By T2-weighted MR imaging, the liver signal intensity gradually increased 
      in both groups but was more pronounced in the CKD group, indicating aggressive 
      utilization of MPB-1523. MR imaging, histology and electron microscopy showed 
      MPB-1523 is liver-specific. (4) Conclusions: MPB-1523 can serve as a long-term 
      iron supplement and is monitored by MR imaging. Our results have strong 
      translatability to the clinic.

AB  - Anemia is common in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and is associated with an 
      increased mortality, morbidity and progressive renal failure. The most common 
      causes of the anemia in CHF are (1) the associated Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), 
      which causes depression of erythropoietin (EPO) production in the kidney, and (2) 
      excessive cytokine production in CHF, which can cause both depression of 
      erythropoietin production in the kidney and depression of erythropoietin response 
      in the bone marrow. The cytokines can also induce iron deficiency by increasing 
      hepcidin production from the liver, which both reduces gastrointestinal iron 
      absorption and reduces iron release from iron stores located in the macrophages 
      and hepatocytes. It appears that iron deficiency is very common in CHF and is 
      rarely recognized or treated. The iron deficiency can cause a thrombocytosis that 
      might contribute to cardiovascular complications in both CHF and CKD and is 
      reversible with iron treatment. Thus, attempts to control this anemia in CHF will 
      have to take into consideration both the use of both Erythropoiesis Stimulating 
      Agents (ESA) such as EPO and oral and, probably more importantly, intravenous 
      (IV) iron. Many studies of anemia in CHF with ESA and oral or IV iron and even 
      with IV iron without ESA have shown a positive effect on hospitalization, New 
      York Heart Association functional class, cardiac and renal function, quality of 
      life, exercise capacity and reduced Beta Natriuretic Peptide and have not 
      demonstrated an increase in cardiovascular damage related to the therapy. 
      However, adequately powered long-term placebo-controlled studies of ESA and of IV 
      iron in CHF are still needed and are currently being carried out.

TI  - How to diagnose iron deficiency in chronic disease: A review of current methods

AB  - Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide. It is 
      often observed in patients with chronic diseases, such as heart failure (HF), 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. ID is 
      associated with poor clinical outcome, including poor performance, reduced 
      quality of life, as well as increased hospitalization and mortality. The aim of 
      this review is to provide an overview about the role of ID in chronic diseases 
      (HF, CKD, IBD, cancer) regarding their current definitions and clinical 
      relevance; diagnostic accuracy of iron parameters in chronic inflammatory 
      conditions and its potential as prognostic markers. Due to different definitions 
      and guideline recommendations of ID, various laboratory parameters for ID 
      diagnostic exist and there is no general consensus about the definition of ID and 
      its treatment. Still, a general trend can be observed across all investigated 
      indications of this review (HF, CKD, IBD, cancer) that serum ferritin and 
      transferrin saturation (TSAT) are the two parameters mentioned most often and 
      emphasized in all guidelines to define ID and guide treatment. The most commonly 
      used threshold values for the diagnosis of ID are TSAT of < 20% and serum 
      ferritin of < 100-300 µg/L. Noteworthy, both TSAT and particularly ferritin are 
      frequently applied, but both may vary due to inflammatory conditions. Studies 
      showed that TSAT is less affected by inflammatory processes and may therefore be 
      more accurate and reliable than serum ferritin, particularly in conditions with 
      elevated inflammatory state. A low iron status and particularly a low TSAT value 
      was associated with a poor outcome in all investigated indications, with the 
      strongest evidence in HF patients. Routine surveillance of iron status in these 
      groups of patients with chronic conditions is advisable to detect ID early. 
      Depending on the inflammatory state, TSAT < 20% may be the more accurate 
      diagnostic marker of ID than ferritin. Moreover, TSAT may also be the more 
      reliable estimate for the prognosis, particularly in HF.

TI  - Iron sucrose ('RBT-3') activates the hepatic and renal HAMP1 gene, evoking renal 
      hepcidin loading and resistance to cisplatin nephrotoxicity.
PG  - 465-474
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfaa348 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron sucrose (FeS) administration induces a state of renal 
      preconditioning, protecting against selected forms of acute kidney injury (AKI). 
      Recent evidence suggests that recombinant hepcidin also mitigates acute renal 
      damage. Hence the goals of this study were to determine whether a new proprietary 
      FeS formulation ('RBT-3') can acutely activate the hepcidin (HAMP1) gene in 
      humans, raising plasma and renal hepcidin concentrations; assess whether the 
      kidney participates in this posited RBT-3-hepcidin generation response; test 
      whether RBT-3 can mitigate a clinically relevant AKI model (experimental 
      cisplatin toxicity) and explore whether mechanisms in addition to hepcidin 
      generation are operative in RBT-3's cytoprotective effects. METHODS: Healthy 
      human volunteers (n = 9) and subjects with Stages 3-4 CKD (n = 9) received 120, 
      240 or 360 mg of RBT-3 (intravenously over 2 h). Plasma and urine samples were 
      collected and assayed for hepcidin levels (0-72 h post-RBT-3 injection). In 
      complementary mouse experiments, RBT-3 effects on hepatic versus renal hepcidin 
      (HAMP1) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were compared. RBT-3's impact on 
      the mouse Nrf2 pathway and on experimental cisplatin nephrotoxicity was assessed. 
      Direct effects of exogenous hepcidin on in vivo and in vitro (HK-2 cells) 
      cisplatin toxicity were also tested. RESULTS: RBT-3 induced rapid, dose-dependent 
      and comparable plasma hepcidin increases in both healthy volunteers and chronic 
      kidney disease subjects (∼15 times baseline within 24 h). Human kidney hepcidin 
      exposure was confirmed by 4-fold urinary hepcidin increases. RBT-3 up-regulated 
      mouse hepcidin mRNA, but much more so in kidney (>25 times) versus liver (∼2 
      times). RBT-3 also activated kidney Nrf2 [increased Nrf2 nuclear binding; 
      increased Nrf2-responsive gene mRNAs: heme oxygenase-1, sulfiredoxin-1, 
      glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1]. 
      RBT-3 preconditioning (18 h time lapse) markedly attenuated experimental 
      cisplatin nephrotoxicity (∼50% blood urea nitrogen/creatinine decrements), in 
      part by reducing renal cisplatin uptake by 40%. Exogenous hepcidin (without 
      RBT-3) treatment conferred protection against mild in vivo (but not in vitro) 
      cisplatin toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: RBT-3 acutely and dramatically up-regulates 
      cytoprotective hepcidin production, increasing renal hepcidin levels. However, 
      additional cytoprotective mechanisms are activated by RBT-3 (e.g. Nrf2 
      activation; reduced cisplatin uptake). Thus RBT-3-induced preconditioning likely 
      confers renal resistance to cisplatin via an interplay of multiple cytoprotective 
      activities.

TI  - Utility of reticulocyte haemoglobin content and percentage hypochromic red cells 
      as markers of iron deficiency anaemia among black CKD patients in South Africa.
PG  - e0204899
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0204899 [doi]
LID - e0204899
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) worsens the prognosis and outcomes of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, while the haemoglobin level is unreliable 
      for early detection of IDA, reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr) and 
      hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) are early markers of IDA. METHODS: This was a cross 
      sectional study of black adult participants (n = 258) with CKD and apparently 
      healthy members of staff and patients' relatives (n = 141) at the Charlotte 
      Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa, between 1 June 2016 and 31 
      December 2016. Serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin were measured using 
      standard laboratory methods, while the haematology analyser was employed to 
      measure CHr and %HYPO. The validity of CHr and %HYPO as markers of IDA were 
      evaluated. Multivariable binary logistic regression was conducted to determine 
      predictors of the relationship between IDA, CHr and %HYPO. The area under the 
      receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of the final models were 
      utilised to evaluate the discriminatory value of CHr and %HYPO respectively. 
      RESULTS: About one-quarter (26.1%) of the participants had IDA which was more 
      than three times more frequent among CKD patients, compared to controls (35.3% vs 
      9.2%); 32.3% (95%CI: 27.90%- 37.10%) of the study population had iron deficiency 
      without anaemia and the prevalence of iron deficiency without anaemia was lower 
      in CKD patients compared to controls (29.5% vs 37.6%). The mean age of CKD 
      patients was higher than in controls (52.7 ±14.3 vs 40.4 ±12.6 years, 
      P-value<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IDA among CKD 
      participants was 62.6% and 80.2% respectively for CHr (at a cut-off value of 
      <28pg) and 63.3% and 79.8% respectively for %HYPO. CKD participants with CHr 
      levels >28pg were 82% less likely to be diagnosed as having IDA as compared to 
      those with CHr levels ≤ 28pg) (adj odds ratio = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.09-0.37). The AUC 
      of CHr (0.81, 95% CI: 0.76-0.87) was higher than the AUC of %HYPO (0.76, 95%CI: 
      0.70-0.82). CONCLUSION: The diagnostic usefulness of CHr and the screening 
      performance of %HYPO in predicting IDA among CKD patients are high. Their lower 
      cost compared to conventional markers of ID recommend their use in clinical 
      practice. Further cost effectiveness studies of these parameters are warranted.

TI  - Hepcidin Response to Iron Therapy in Patients with Non-Dialysis Dependent CKD: An 
      Analysis of the FIND-CKD Trial.
PG  - e0157063

LID - e0157063
AB  - Hepcidin is the key regulator of iron homeostasis but data are limited regarding 
      its temporal response to iron therapy, and response to intravenous versus oral 
      iron. In the 56-week, open-label, multicenter, prospective, randomized FIND-CKD 
      study, 626 anemic patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease 
      (ND-CKD) and iron deficiency not receiving an erythropoiesis stimulating agent 
      were randomized (1:1:2) to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting 
      higher (400-600μg/L) or lower (100-200μg/L) ferritin, or to oral iron. Serum 
      hepcidin levels were measured centrally in a subset of 61 patients. Mean (SD) 
      baseline hepcidin level was 4.0(3.5), 7.3(6.4) and 6.5(5.6) ng/mL in the high 
      ferritin FCM (n = 17), low ferritin FCM (n = 16) and oral iron group (n = 28). 
      The mean (SD) endpoint value (i.e. the last post-baseline value) was 
      26.0(9.1),15.7(7.7) and 16.3(11.0) ng/mL, respectively. The increase in hepcidin 
      from baseline was significantly smaller with low ferritin FCM or oral iron vs 
      high ferritin FCM at all time points up to week 52. Significant correlations were 
      found between absolute hepcidin and ferritin values (r = 0.65, p<0.001) and 
      between final post-baseline increases in both parameters (r = 0.70, p<0.001). The 
      increase in hepcidin levels over the 12-month study generally mirrored the 
      cumulative iron dose in each group. Hepcidin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) 
      absolute values showed no correlation, although there was an association between 
      final post-baseline increases (r = 0.42, p<0.001). Absolute values (r = 0.36, p = 
      0.004) and final post-baseline increases of hepcidin and hemoglobin (p = 0.30, p 
      = 0.030) correlated weakly. Baseline hepcidin levels were not predictive of a 
      hematopoietic response to iron therapy. In conclusion, hepcidin levels rose in 
      response to either intravenous or oral iron therapy, but the speed and extent of 
      the rise was greatest with intravenous iron targeting a higher ferritin level. 
      However neither the baseline level nor the change in hepcidin was able to predict 
      response to therapy in this cohort.

TI  - Additional burden of iron deficiency in heart failure patients beyond the 
      cardio-renal anaemia syndrome: findings from the BIOSTAT-CHF study.
PG  - 192-204
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.2393 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Whereas the combination of anaemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has 
      been extensively studied in patients with heart failure (HF), the contribution of 
      iron deficiency (ID) to this dysfunctional interplay is unknown. We aimed to 
      assess clinical associates and pathophysiological pathways related to ID in this 
      multimorbid syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 2151 patients with HF from 
      the BIOSTAT-CHF cohort. Patients were stratified based on ID (transferrin 
      saturation <20%), anaemia (World Health Organization definition) and/or CKD 
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ). Patients were 
      mainly men (73.3%), with a median age of 70.5 (interquartile range 61.4-78.1). ID 
      was more prevalent than CKD and anaemia (63.3%, 47.2% and 35.6% respectively), 
      with highest prevalence in those with concomitant CKD and anaemia (77.5% vs. 
      59.3%; p < 0.001). There was a considerable overlap in biomarkers and pathways 
      between patients with isolated ID, anaemia or CKD, or in combination, with 
      processes related to immunity, inflammation, cell survival and cancer amongst the 
      common pathways. Key biomarkers shared between syndromes with ID included 
      transferrin receptor, interleukin-6, fibroblast growth factor-23, and bone 
      morphogenetic protein 6. Having ID, either alone or on top of anaemia and/or CKD, 
      was associated with a lower overall summary Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
      Questionnaire score, an impaired 6-min walk test and increased incidence of 
      hospitalizations and/or mortality in multivariable analyses (all p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency, CKD and/or anaemia in patients with HF have great 
      overlap in biomarker profiles, suggesting common pathways associated with these 
      syndromes. ID either alone or on top of CKD and anaemia is associated with worse 
      quality of life, exercise capacity and prognosis of patients with worsening HF.

TI  - Erythropoietin and iron for anemia in HIV-infected patients undergoing 
      maintenance hemodialysis in China: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 60

LID - 60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      HIV infection. The number of people living with HIV on hemodialysis (HD) is 
      increasing. However, there is no data about anemia and related therapies in this 
      kind of patients in China. We aim to assess the difference in hemoglobin (Hgb) 
      and treatments like erythropoietin and iron between HIV-HD patients and HD 
      patients in Chengdu, China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted 
      with data collection from January 2020 to June 2020. Thirty-four HIV-infected HD 
      patients and thirty-five non-HIV-infected HD patients were included. Age, gender, 
      dialysis vintage, single-pool (sp) Kt/V, Hgb, the dose of erythropoietin, 
      ferritin, use of iron preparations, and serum albumin were collected in all 
      patients. Time since HIV diagnosis, counts of CD4 + T cells, HIV RNA, and 
      antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection were collected in HIV-infected patients. 
      T-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square statistics were applied in SPSS. 
      RESULTS: The Hgb of HIV-HD and HD groups were 105.70 (95.93-112.08) g/L and 
      112.00 (93.00-126.00) g/L respectively (P = 0.064). There was a statistically 
      significant higher erythropoietin dosage used in the HIV-HD population 
      (222.55 ± 115.47 U/kg/week) compared to the HIV-negative HD group 
      (161.86 ± 110.31 U/kg/week) (P = 0.029). 16/34 (47.06%) HIV-HD patients and 5/35 
      (14.29%) HD patients were treated with iron preparations (P = 0.003). The 
      ferritin levels were 316.50 (117.38-589.75) ng/ml and 272.70 (205.00-434.00) 
      ng/ml in HIV-HD and HD groups respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A higher erythropoietin 
      dosage and a higher probability of iron preparations may be required to maintain 
      Hgb in HIV-HD patients compared with HD patients.

TI  - A hepcidin lowering agent mobilizes iron for incorporation into red blood cells 
      in an adenine-induced kidney disease model of anemia in rats.
PG  - 1733-43
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfs584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that 
      negatively impacts the quality of life and is associated with numerous adverse 
      outcomes. Excess levels of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin are thought to 
      contribute to anemia in CKD patients by decreasing iron availability from the 
      diet and from body stores. Adenine treatment in rats has been proposed as an 
      animal model of anemia of CKD with high hepcidin levels that mirrors the 
      condition in human patients. METHODS: We developed a modified adenine-induced 
      kidney disease model with a higher survival rate than previously reported models, 
      while maintaining persistent kidney disease and anemia. We then tested whether 
      the small molecule bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor LDN-193189, which 
      was previously shown to lower hepcidin levels in rodents, mobilized iron into the 
      plasma and improved iron-restricted erythropoiesis in this model. RESULTS: 
      Adenine-treated rats exhibited increased hepatic hepcidin mRNA, decreased serum 
      iron, increased spleen iron content, low hemoglobin (Hb) and inappropriately low 
      erythropoietin (EPO) levels relative to the degree of anemia. LDN-193189 
      administration to adenine-treated rats lowered hepatic hepcidin mRNA, mobilized 
      stored iron into plasma and increased Hb content of reticulocytes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our data suggest that hepcidin lowering agents may provide a new therapeutic 
      strategy to improve iron availability for erythropoiesis in CKD.

TI  - Hb level, iron intake and mortality in Chinese adults: a 10-year follow-up study.
PG  - 572-581
LID - 10.1017/S000711451700040X [doi]
AB  - Anaemia is prevalent in developing countries and is commonly Fe deficiency 
      related. We aimed to assess the association between Fe status, Fe intake and 
      mortality among Chinese adults. We prospectively studied 8291 adults aged 20-98 
      years with a mean follow-up of 9·9 years. All participants were measured for Hb 
      at baseline in 2002. Food intake, measured by 3-d weighed food record (n 2832), 
      and fasting serum ferritin were measured. We documented 491 deaths (including 192 
      CVD and 165 cancer deaths) during 81 527 person-years of follow-up. There was a 
      U-shaped association between Hb levels and all-cause mortality. Compared with the 
      second quartile of Hb (121 g/l), the first (105) and fourth quartile (144) had 
      hazard ratios (HR) of 2·29 (95 % CI 1·51, 3·48) and 2·31 (95 % CI 1·46, 3·64) for 
      all-cause mortality in women. In men, compared with third quartile of Hb (143 
      g/l), first (122) and fourth quartiles (154) had 61 and 65 % increased risk of 
      all-cause mortality. Anaemia was associated with an increased risk of all-cause 
      and CVD mortality in men but not in women after adjusting for potential 
      confounders. Low and high Fe intake as percentage of Chinese recommended nutrient 
      intake (RNI) were positively associated with all-cause mortality in women but not 
      in men. In women, across quartiles of relative Fe intake, HR for all-cause 
      mortality were 2·55 (95 % CI 0·99, 6·57), 1·00, 3·12 (95 % CI 1·35, 7·18) and 
      2·78 (95 % CI 1·02, 7·58). Both low and high Hb levels are related to increased 
      risk of all-cause mortality. Both low and high intake of Fe as percentage of RNI 
      was positively associated with mortality in women.

TI  - An analysis of the health service efficiency and patient experience with two 
      different intravenous iron preparations in a UK anaemia clinic.
PG  - 108-14
LID - 10.3111/13696998.2012.731458 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, the Renal Unit at King's College Hospital used 
      intravenous (IV) iron sucrose (IS) to treat iron deficiency anaemia in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease who were not on dialysis (CKD-ND). As part of a 
      service initiative to improve patient experience, new products were considered as 
      alternatives. This study investigated the potential impact on patient experience 
      and service costs by switching from IS to ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). METHODS: A 
      decision analytical model was used to calculate the impact of switching from IS 
      to FCM for a cohort of CKD-ND patients. Service provision data were collected for 
      365 patients who received 600 mg IS within a 12 month period, creating the IS 
      data set. The service provision data, along with a clinically relevant FCM 
      administration protocol (stipulating total doses of 500 mg FCM), were used to 
      calculate a corresponding theoretical data set for FCM for the same cohort of 
      patients. RESULTS: The FCM protocol saved each patient two hospital visits and 
      2.66 hours of time (equating to approximately a saving of £36.21 in loss of 
      earnings) and £19 in travel costs. Direct attributable costs for iron 
      administration (which included drug, disposables, nursing staff, and 
      hospital-provided patient transport costs) were £58,646 for IS vs £46,473 for 
      FCM. Direct overhead costs (which included nursing preparation time, 
      administration staff, clinic space, and consultant time costs) were £40,172 for 
      the IS service vs £15,174 for the FCM service. LIMITATIONS: Based on clinical 
      experience with the products, this analysis assumes that 500 mg FCM is 
      therapeutically equivalent to 600 mg IS. Consultant time costs are assumed to be 
      the same between the two treatment groups. IV iron administration protocols and 
      data are specific to King's College Hospital. The design is retrospective and 
      changes to the management of the clinic, including service delivery optimization, 
      may also affect real costs. CONCLUSION: FCM was associated with fewer hospital 
      visits and reduced transport costs for CKD-ND patients receiving IV iron and has 
      the potential to save 19-37% in service costs. Owing to increased administration 
      efficiency, FCM can improve the overall patient experience while reducing the 
      total cost of the King's College Hospital IV iron service for CKD-ND patients, 
      compared with treatment with IS.

TI  - Administration of intravenous iron sucrose as a 2-minute push to CKD patients: a 
      prospective evaluation of 2,297 injections.
PG  - 283-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron supplementation is an integral part of the 
      management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Traditionally, this 
      has been administered as an infusion over 1 or more hours, which requires the use 
      of intravenous fluids and administration tubing, along with extra demands on 
      patient and nursing time. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the safety and 
      practicality of administering iron sucrose, 200 mg, as a bolus injection over 2 
      minutes in patients with chronic kidney disease. A total of 2,297 injections were 
      administered to 657 patients. Any adverse events were recorded, including acute 
      anaphylactoid reactions to the iron injection, along with the presence or absence 
      of metallic taste and phlebitis, and these were classified as "serious" and 
      "nonserious." RESULTS: The most common adverse event was a mild and transient 
      metallic taste that occurred during 412 injections (17.9%); in no case was this 
      of significant distress to the patient. Excluding this, 2,240 injections (97.5%) 
      proceeded uneventfully, and no case of phlebitis was recorded. Adverse events 
      other than metallic taste were recorded in association with 57 injections (2.5%). 
      Seven of these were caused by an acute anaphylactoid reaction to the intravenous 
      iron. All 7 acute reactions resolved completely within 30 minutes with no 
      sequelae, and none required hospitalization. The remaining 50 adverse events 
      consisted of pain during the injection (n = 31), pain after the injection with or 
      without some bruising (n = 9), nausea/gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 3), lethargy 
      (n = 4), and lightheadedness (n = 3). CONCLUSION: Administration of 200 mg of 
      iron sucrose as an intravenous bolus injection over 2 minutes is a practical 
      dosing regimen in patients with chronic kidney disease, resulting in considerable 
      savings in time and cost.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Iron-deficiency anemia is common in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) not requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT). We evaluated 
      effects of oral iron replacement therapy with ferric maltol in these patients. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
      (AEGIS-CKD) and open-label extension. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adults with stage 3 
      or 4 CKD and iron-deficiency anemia at 30 US centers. INTERVENTION: Oral ferric 
      maltol at 30mg or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks (2:1 randomization) followed 
      by ferric maltol at 30mg twice daily for up to 36 weeks (all patients). OUTCOME: 
      Change from baseline in hemoglobin (primary end point at week 16), ferritin, 
      transferrin saturation, and serum iron; safety. RESULTS: 167 patients were 
      randomized (ferric maltol, n=111; placebo, n=56). At week 16, hemoglobin had 
      increased significantly with ferric maltol versus placebo (least-squares mean 
      difference: 0.5±0.2 [SE] g/dL; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P=0.01). Ferritin, transferrin 
      saturation, and serum iron increased with ferric maltol but declined with placebo 
      (all P<0.05). Hemoglobin levels were sustained up to week 52 in patients 
      continuing ferric maltol and increased in patients switching from placebo to 
      ferric maltol. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (randomized 
      phase: 41% vs 30% [ferric maltol vs placebo]; open-label phase: 56% vs 46%, 
      respectively). Adverse events led to treatment withdrawal in 7 patients (6%) 
      receiving ferric maltol and 5 patients (9%) receiving placebo during double-blind 
      treatment, and 11 patients (9%) during the open-label extension. LIMITATIONS: 
      Heterogeneity in baseline ferritin levels; high proportion of female 
      participants; single-arm open-label extension. CONCLUSIONS: Ferric maltol was 
      associated with statistically significant (week 16) and sustained (up to week 52) 
      increases in hemoglobin and iron indices in patients with CKD and iron 
      deficiency, and was well tolerated during treatment for up to 52 weeks. FUNDING:

TI  - Intravenous Versus Oral Iron Supplementation for the Treatment of Anemia in CKD: 
      An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron supplementation is crucial for the treatment of anemia of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although intravenous (IV) iron is preferred for 
      patients with CKD receiving dialysis (CKD stage 5D), the method of iron 
      replacement for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 is controversial. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed until October 2015 of 
      MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference 
      lists of included trials. SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 
      or 5D. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: All randomized controlled trials, 
      regardless of publication status or language. INTERVENTION: IV versus oral iron 
      supplementation. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was defined as percentage of 
      patients reaching an elevation in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration > 1g/dL. 
      Secondary end points included percentage of patients who reached Hb levels > 
      11g/dL, absolute Hb concentration, change in Hb concentration, transferrin 
      saturation, ferritin levels, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and blood 
      transfusion requirement, and quality of life. Safety analysis included all-cause 
      mortality and serious and all adverse events. RESULTS: 24 trials were identified, 
      13 including 2,369 patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 and 11 including 818 patients 
      with CKD stage 5D. Patients treated with IV iron were more likely to reach an Hb 
      response > 1g/dL (risk ratios [RRs] of 1.61 [95% CI, 1.39-1.87] for CKD stages 
      3-5 and 2.14 [95% CI, 1.68-2.72] for CKD stage 5D). Safety analysis showed 
      similar rates of mortality and serious and any adverse effects. IV iron 
      replacement was associated with higher risk for hypotension (RR, 3.71; 95% CI, 
      1.74-7.94) and fewer gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 
      0.28-0.67). LIMITATIONS: Significant heterogeneity between trials; follow-up was 
      usually limited to 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results agree with current 
      recommendations for IV iron replacement for patients with CKD stage 5D and 
      support increased use of IV iron for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5.

      improves iron utilization and anemia of inflammation: Comparative study against 
      recombinant erythropoietin in rat.

AB  - Anemia with inflammation-induced defective iron utilization is a pathological 
      condition observed in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) or 
      chronic inflammatory disease. There is no reasonable treatment for these 
      conditions, because the effects of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) or 
      iron supplementation in the treatment of anemia are insufficient. JTZ-951 
      (enarodustat) has been characterized as a novel, orally bioavailable inhibitor of 
      hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH), and has been developed as a 
      novel therapeutic agent for anemia with CKD. In this study, the effects of 
      JTZ-951 on iron utilization during erythropoiesis and on anemia of inflammation 
      were compared with those of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) using 
      normal rat and rat model of anemia of inflammation. In normal rats, under 
      conditions in which JTZ-951 and rHuEPO showed similar erythropoietic effect, 
      repeated doses of JTZ-951 induced erythropoiesis while retaining the hemoglobin 
      content in red blood cells, while administration of rHuEPO resulted in decrease 
      in some erythrocyte-related parameters. As for iron-related parameters during 
      erythropoiesis, JTZ-951 exhibited more efficient iron utilization compared to 
      rHuEPO. A single dose of JTZ-951 resulted in decrease in hepcidin expression 
      observed within 24 h after administration, but a single dose of rHuEPO did not. 
      In a rat model of anemia of inflammation (also known as a model with functional 
      iron-deficiency), JTZ-951 showed erythropoietic effect, in contrast with rHuEPO. 
      These results suggest that, unlike rHuEPO, JTZ-951 stimulates erythropoiesis by 
      increasing iron utilization, and improves anemia of inflammation.

TI  - Serum Biomarkers of Iron Stores Are Associated with Increased Risk of All-Cause 
      Mortality and Cardiovascular Events in Nondialysis CKD Patients, with or without 
      Anemia.
PG  - 2020-2030
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2020101531 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 30%-45% of patients with nondialysis CKD have iron 
      deficiency. Iron therapy in CKD has focused primarily on supporting 
      erythropoiesis. In patients with or without anemia, there has not been a 
      comprehensive approach to estimating the association between serum biomarkers of 
      iron stores, and mortality and cardiovascular event risks. METHODS: The study 
      included 5145 patients from Brazil, France, the United States, and Germany 
      enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, with 
      first available transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin levels as exposure 
      variables. We used Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause 
      mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with progressive 
      adjustment for potentially confounding variables. We also used linear spline 
      models to further evaluate functional forms of the exposure-outcome associations. 
      RESULTS: Compared with patients with a TSAT of 26%-35%, those with a TSAT ≤15% 
      had the highest adjusted risks for all-cause mortality and MACE. Spline analysis 
      found the lowest risk at TSAT 40% for all-cause mortality and MACE. Risk of 
      all-cause mortality, but not MACE, was also elevated at TSAT ≥46%. Effect 
      estimates were similar after adjustment for hemoglobin. For ferritin, no 
      directional associations were apparent, except for elevated all-cause mortality 
      at ferritin ≥300 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency, as captured by TSAT, is 
      associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality and MACE in patients with 
      nondialysis CKD, with or without anemia. Interventional studies evaluating the 
      effect on clinical outcomes of iron supplementation and therapies for alternative 
      targets are needed to better inform strategies for administering exogenous iron.

TI  - Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIOs): a future alternative magnetic 
      resonance (MR) contrast agent for patients at risk for nephrogenic systemic 
      fibrosis (NSF)?
PG  - 465-74
LID - 10.1038/ki.2008.496 [doi]
AB  - Gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agents (GBCAs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      are used in daily clinical practice and appear safe in most patients; however, 
      nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a recently recognized severe complication 
      associated with GBCAs. It affects primarily patients with renal disease, such as 
      stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD; glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min 
      per 1.73 m(2)), acute kidney injury, or kidney and liver transplant recipients 
      with kidney dysfunction. Contrast-enhanced MRI and computed tomography (CT) scans 
      provide important clinical information and influence patient management. An 
      alternative contrast agent is needed to obtain adequate imaging results while 
      avoiding the risk of NSF in this vulnerable patient group. One potential 
      alternative is ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles, 
      which provide enhancement characteristics similar to GBCAs. We review our 
      experience in approximately 150 patients on the potential benefits of the USPIOs 
      ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol. We focus on central nervous system (CNS) MRI but 
      also review imaging of other vascular beds. Safety studies, including USPIO 
      administration (ferumoxytol) as iron supplement therapy in CKD patients on and 
      not on dialysis, suggest that decreased kidney function does not alter the safety 
      profile. We conclude that for both CNS MR imaging and MR angiography, USPIO 
      agents like ferumoxytol are a viable option for patients at risk for NSF.

TI  - Liver iron is a major regulator of hepcidin gene expression via BMP/SMAD pathway 
      in a rat model of chronic renal failure under treatment with high rHuEPO doses.
PG  - 296-306
LID - 10.1002/biof.1275 [doi]
AB  - Hepcidin is the major central regulator of iron metabolism, controlling iron 
      absorption and mobilization. Considering its interaction with several factors 
      that are altered in chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in hyporesponsive 
      CKD patients under therapy with high recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) 
      doses, it was aimed to study the impact of increasing rHuEPO doses on the 
      regulation of iron-hepcidin metabolism. The blood, cellular, and tissue studies, 
      using the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, under 
      rHuEPO (100, 200, 400, and 600 IU/Kg body weight [BW]/week) treatment during 3 
      weeks were performed. It was found that the rHuEPO stimulus triggered a first 
      wave to achieve correction of anemia, by inhibiting hepcidin synthesis, favoring 
      erythropoiesis and iron absorption; this continuous stimulus enhanced iron 
      absorption leading to iron overload, as showed by the hepatic iron deposits found 
      in rats treated with higher rHuEPO dose that seems to trigger the upregulation of 
      hepcidin synthesis through the activation of the BMP6/SMAD pathway. The data 
      suggested that liver iron overload was an important stimuli for hepcidin 
      synthesis, stronger than the inhibitory effect of high rHuEPO doses; moreover, 
      the findings raised the hypothesis that when high inflammation (triggering 
      hepcidin expression) was associated with increased iron stores in hemodialysis 
      patients, hepcidin expression was also upregulated via BMP6, enhancing hepcidin 
      synthesis, leading, therefore, to worsening of anemia and, eventually, to a 
      hyporesponse/resistance to rHuEPO therapy. © 2016 BioFactors, 42(3):296-306,

      associations of bolus versus maintenance iron dosing and high versus low ESA 
      dosing on HRQoL. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort design. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: Clinical data (2008-2010) from a large dialysis organization merged 
      with data from the US Renal Data System. 13,039 patients receiving center-based 
      hemodialysis were included. PREDICTOR: Iron and ESA dosing were assessed during 
      1-month (n=14,901) and 2-week (n=15,296) exposure periods. OUTCOMES: HRQoL was 
      measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) instrument (0-100 scale) 
      during a 3-month follow-up period. MEASUREMENTS: Generalized linear mixed models, 
      adjusting for several covariates, were used to estimate associations between iron 
      and ESA dosing and HRQoL overall and for clinically relevant subgroups. RESULTS: 
      For the 1-month exposure period, patients with lower baseline hemoglobin levels 
      who received higher ESA dosing had higher physical health and kidney disease 
      symptom scores (by 2.4 [95% CI, 0.6-4.2] and 5.6 [95% CI, 2.8-8.4] points, 
      respectively) in follow-up than patients who received lower ESA dosing. For the 
      2-week exposure period, patients with low baseline hemoglobin levels who received 
      bolus dosing had higher mental health scores (by 1.9 [95% CI, 0.0-3.8] points) in 
      follow-up. Within the low-baseline-hemoglobin subgroup, individuals with a 
      catheter or dialysis vintage less than 1 year who received higher ESA dosing had 
      higher HRQoL scores in follow-up (by 5.0-9.9 points) and individuals with low 
      baseline transferrin saturations who received bolus dosing had higher HRQoL 
      scores in follow-up (by 2.6-5.8 points). LIMITATIONS: Observational design; short 
      duration of observation. CONCLUSIONS: For individuals with low baseline 
      hemoglobin levels, higher ESA dosing and bolus iron dosing were associated with 
      slightly higher HRQoL scores in follow-up. These differences became more 
      pronounced and clinically relevant for specific subgroups.

TI  - Iron-induced calcification in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells through 
      interleukin-24 (IL-24), with/without TNF-alpha.
PG  - 658

AB  - In CKD patients, arteriosclerotic lesions, including calcification, can occur in 
      vascular smooth muscle cells in a process called Moenckeberg's medial 
      arteriosclerosis. Iron overload induces several complications, including the 
      acceleration of arteriosclerosis. However, the relationship between Moenckeberg's 
      arteriosclerosis in vascular smooth muscle cells and iron accumulation has 
      remained unknown. We tested the accelerated effect of iron on calcification in 
      cultured human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). After establishment 
      of this model, we performed a microarray analysis using mRNA from early stage 
      culture HASMCs after iron stimulation with or without TNF-alpha stimulation. The 
      role of interleukin-24 (IL-24) was confirmed from candidate genes that might 
      contribute to calcification. HASMCs demonstrated calcification induced by iron 
      and TNF-alpha. Calcification of HASMCs was synergistically enhanced by 
      stimulation with both iron and TNF-alpha. In the early phase of calcification, 
      microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of IL-24. Stimulation of HASMCs by 
      IL-24 instead of iron induced calcification. The anti-IL-24 antibody reversed the 
      effect of IL-24, supporting the important role of IL-24 in HASMCs calcification. 
      In conclusion, iron-induced calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells 
      occurred via IL-24, IL-24 was increased during the calcification process induced 
      by iron, and IL-24 itself caused calcification in the absence of iron.

TI  - Effects of hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors vs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of five hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl 
      hydroxylase domain inhibitors (HIF-PHIs), two erythropoiesis-stimulating agents 
      (ESAs), and placebo on iron metabolism in renal anemia patients with 
      non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). METHOD: Five electronic 
      databases were searched for studies. Randomized controlled clinical trials 
      comparing HIF-PHIs, ESAs, and placebo in NDD-CKD patients were selected. The 
      statistical program used for network meta-analysis was Stata/SE 15.1. The main 
      outcomes were the change in hepcidin and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. The merits of 
      intervention measures were predicted by the surface under the cumulative ranking 
      curve method. RESULTS: Of 1,589 original titles screened, data were extracted 
      from 15 trials (3,228 participants). All HIF-PHIs and ESAs showed greater Hb 
      level-raising ability than placebo. Among them, desidustat demonstrated the 
      highest probability of increasing Hb (95.6%). Hepcidin [mean deviation (MD) = 
      -43.42, 95%CI: -47.08 to -39.76], ferritin (MD= -48.56, 95%CI: -55.21 to -41.96), 
      and transferrin saturation (MD = -4.73, 95%CI: -5.52 to -3.94) were decreased, 
      while transferrin (MD = 0.09, 95%CI: 0.01 to 0.18) and total iron-binding 
      capacity (MD = 6.34, 95%CI: 5.71 to 6.96) was increased in HIF-PHIs versus those 
      in ESAs. In addition, this study observed heterogeneity in the ability of 
      HIF-PHIs to decrease hepcidin. Compared with darbepoetin, only daprodustat (MD = 
      -49.09, 95% CI: -98.13 to -0.05) could significantly reduce hepcidin levels. 
      Meanwhile, daprodustat also showed the highest hepcidin-lowering efficacy 
      (84.0%), while placebo was the lowest (8.2%). CONCLUSION: For NDD-CKD patients, 
      HIF-PHIs could ameliorate functional iron deficiency by promoting iron transport 
      and utilization, which may be achieved by decreasing hepcidin levels. 
      Interestingly, HIF-PHIs had heterogeneous effects on iron metabolism. SYSTEMATIC

TI  - A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ferric citrate for the 
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia and reduction of serum phosphate in patients 
      with CKD Stages 3-5.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia and serum phosphate levels > 4.0mg/dL are 
      relatively common in chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5 and are associated with 
      higher risks of progressive loss of kidney function, cardiovascular events, and 
      mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. 
      SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 149 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 
      60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin, 9.0-12.0 g/dL; 
      transferrin saturation [TSAT]≤ 30%, serum ferritin ≤ 300 ng/mL), and serum 
      phosphate levels ≥ 4.0 to 6.0mg/dL. Use of intravenous iron or 
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was prohibited. INTERVENTION: Randomization to 
      treatment for 12 weeks with ferric citrate coordination complex (ferric citrate) 
      or placebo. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary end points were change in TSAT and 
      serum phosphate level from baseline to end of study. Secondary outcomes included 
      change from baseline to end of treatment in values for ferritin, hemoglobin, 
      intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), urinary phosphate excretion, and 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: Ferric citrate treatment increased 
      mean TSAT from 22% ± 7% (SD) to 32% ± 14% and reduced serum phosphate levels from 
      4.5 ± 0.6 to 3.9 ± 0.6 mg/dL, while placebo exerted no effect on TSAT (21% ± 8% 
      to 20% ± 8%) and less effect on serum phosphate level (4.7 ± 0.6 to 4.4 ± 0.8 
      mg/dL; between-group P<0.001 for each). Ferric citrate increased hemoglobin 
      levels (from 10.5 ± 0.8 to 11.0 ± 1.0 g/dL; P<0.001 vs placebo), reduced urinary 
      phosphate excretion 39% (P<0.001 vs placebo), and reduced serum intact FGF-23 
      levels from a median of 159 (IQR, 102-289) to 105 (IQR, 65-187) pg/mL (P=0.02 vs 
      placebo). The incidence and severity of adverse effects were similar between 
      treatment arms. LIMITATIONS: The study is limited by relatively small sample size 
      and short duration and by having biochemical rather than clinical outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Short-term use of ferric citrate repletes iron stores, increases 
      hemoglobin levels, and reduces levels of serum phosphate, urinary phosphate 
      excretion, and FGF-23 in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5.
