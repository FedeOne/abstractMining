OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that are associated with the incidence of YOD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study used data from the UK Biobank, with baseline assessment between 2006 and 2010 and follow-up until March 31, 2021, for England and Scotland, and February 28, 2018, for Wales. Participants younger than 65 years and without a dementia diagnosis at baseline assessment were included in this study. Participants who were 65 years and older and those with dementia at baseline were excluded. Data were analyzed from May 2022 to April 2023.
EXPOSURES: A total of 39 potential risk factors were identified from systematic reviews of late-onset dementia and YOD risk factors and grouped into domains of sociodemographic factors (education, socioeconomic status, and sex), genetic factors (apolipoprotein E), lifestyle factors (physical activity, alcohol use, alcohol use disorder, smoking, diet, cognitive activity, social isolation, and marriage), environmental factors (nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, pesticide, and diesel), blood marker factors (vitamin D, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate function, and albumin), cardiometabolic factors (stroke, hypertension, diabetes, hypoglycemia, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and aspirin use), psychiatric factors (depression, anxiety, benzodiazepine use, delirium, and sleep problems), and other factors (traumatic brain injury, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid dysfunction, hearing impairment, and handgrip strength).
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the association between the risk factors and incidence of YOD. Factors were tested stepwise first within domains and then across domains.
RESULTS: Of 356 052 included participants, 197 036 (55.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age at baseline was 54.6 (7.0) years. During 2 891 409 person-years of follow-up, 485 incident YOD cases (251 of 485 men [51.8%]) were observed, yielding an incidence rate of 16.8 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 15.4-18.3). In the final model, 15 factors were significantly associated with a higher YOD risk, namely lower formal education, lower socioeconomic status, carrying 2 apolipoprotein ε4 allele, no alcohol use, alcohol use disorder, social isolation, vitamin D deficiency, high C-reactive protein levels, lower handgrip strength, hearing impairment, orthostatic hypotension, stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and depression.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, several factors, mostly modifiable, were associated with a higher risk of YOD. These modifiable risk factors should be incorporated in future dementia prevention initiatives and raise new therapeutic possibilities for YOD.","2023",,"JAMA Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : To examine factors that are associated with the incidence of YOD ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

However, the impact of prior TBI on blood biomarkers for ADRD remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Using cross-sectional data, we assessed whether a history of TBI influences serum biomarkers in a diverse cohort (approximately 50% Hispanic) with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia.
METHODS: Levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NFL), total tau (T-tau), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1) were measured for participants across the cognitive spectrum. Participants were categorized based on presence and absence of a history of TBI with loss of consciousness, and study samples were derived through case-control matching. Multivariable general linear models compared concentrations of biomarkers in relation to a history of TBI and smoothing splines modelled biomarkers non-linearly in the cognitively impaired groups as a function of time since symptom onset.
RESULTS: Each biomarker was higher across stages of cognitive impairment, characterized by clinical diagnosis and Mini-Mental State Examination performance, but these associations were not influenced by a history of TBI. However, modelling biomarkers in relation to duration of cognitive symptoms for ADRD showed differences by history of TBI, with only GFAP and UCHL1 being elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum GFAP, NFL, T-tau, and UCHL1 were higher across stages of cognitive impairment in this diverse clinical cohort, regardless of TBI history, though longitudinal investigation of the timing, order, and trajectory of the biomarkers in relation to prior TBI is warranted.","2023",,"J Alzheimers Dis"," OBJECTIVE : Using cross-sectional data , we assessed whether a history of TBI influences serum biomarkers in a diverse cohort ( approximately 50 % Hispanic ) with normal cognition , mild cognitive impairment , or dementia ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Its clinical manifestations include a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive domains, as well as brain atrophy. An elevated homocysteine level (>15 µmol/L), known as hyperhomocysteinemia, is also an attributing risk factor for AD, vascular pathologies, and brain atrophy. Neuroimaging studies including T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in the periventricular and deep white matter, enlarged ventricles, widened sulci, and decreased white matter mass, which are features of aging, as well as cerebrovascular changes. This case series investigated changes in biochemical marker levels including serum homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12, and the degree of atrophic variations in cortical-subcortical white matter in AD. The present study hypothesized that serum homocysteine levels in the brain might be used as a surrogate marker to screen for AD at an earlier stage.","2023",,"Ann Geriatr Med Res",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Thus, the identification of risk factors for cognitive impairment is of great significance for dementia prevention. This study aims to examine the joint associations of sleep duration and physical activity with cognitive impairment among rural elderly over 65 years old, and provide suggestions for improving the cognitive function in rural elderly over 65 years old.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural Nanjing by recruiting 1147 individuals aged above 65 years. Cognitive function was assessed using the brief community screening instrument for dementia. Physical activity was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression models, and a significant difference was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Compared with participants with proper sleep duration and sufficient physical activity, participants with short sleep duration and insufficient physical activity (odds ratio (OR): 1.820; 95% CI: 1.265 ~ 2.618), long sleep duration and sufficient physical activity (OR: 2.428; 95% CI: 1.137 ~ 5.183) showed an increased likelihood of cognitive impairment.

We investigated the frequency of RBD during the progression of PD in the advanced stages and identified potential risk factors for developing RBD earlier or later.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis and determined the frequency of RBD in all PD in-patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages ≥3) with motor fluctuations who had undergone video-polysomnography (vPSG) for a sleep complaint or daytime sleepiness. To correct for selection bias, we analyzed the prevalence of RBD in PD patients from the DeNoPa cohort. PD patients with RBD were compared with PD without RBD. To identify potential risk factors, we performed multiple regression modeling.
RESULTS: A total of 504 PD patients had vPSG. 37 were excluded due to missing REM or artifacts during REM. RBD was present in 406/467 (86.9%) PD patients. PD + RBD patients were older than PDnonRBD (69 ± 7.7 vs. 64 ± 9.2 years,

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study of 6428 individuals (mean age 50.9±7.6 years) from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study.
MEASURES: Cardiorespiratory fitness and BMI were assessed twice (1970-1999) during visits to the Cooper Clinic, a preventive medicine clinic in Dallas, Texas. These measures were examined as continuous and categorical variables. As continuous variables, fitness and BMI were examined at baseline (averaged of two examinations) and as absolute change between exams (mean time 2.1±1.8 years). Variables were categorised: unfit versus fit and normal versus overweight/obese. Medicare claims data were used to obtain all-cause dementia incidence (1999-2009). Mean follow-up between midlife examinations and Medicare surveillance was 15.7 ((SD=6.2) years. Multivariable models were used to assess the associations between fitness, BMI and dementia.
RESULTS: During 40 773 person years of Medicare surveillance, 632 cases of dementia were identified. After controlling for BMI and covariates, each 1-metabolic equivalent increment in fitness was associated with 5% lower (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99) dementia risk.

This study aims to develop a risk prognostic model for mid- to late-stage PD and identify prognostic factors that are indicative of impending loss of balance and falls.
METHODS: The study included 307 participants of which 75 were diagnosed with idiopathic PD and 232 were neurological or non-neurological controls. Among the PD group, 46 were early-stage (Hoehn and Yahr [H&Y] = 1,2) with no significant loss of balance while 29 were mid- to late-stage (H&Y = 3,4,5) which is characterized by loss of balance and falls. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) was used to develop a prognostic model for mid- to late-stage PD. Model discrimination was assessed by ROC curves. The model was internally validated through bootstrapping and calibration plots.
RESULTS: The relevant factors identified and included in the final MLR model were shortness of breath, age, swollen joints, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein, and total salivary protein. The model had an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI = 0.71-0.92) and was well calibrated (calibration slope = 0.77, intercept = 0.03). The likelihood of shortness of breath (OR = 7.91, 95% CI = 1.63-45.12) was significantly higher among mid- to late-stage PD than early-stage.

Long-term, large sample size studies assessing NDDs association with objective sleep measures are scant. We aimed to investigate whether video-polysomnography (v-PSG)-based sleep features are associated with long-term NDDs incidence.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients referred 2004-2007 to the Sleep Disorders Unit, Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria. All patients ≥18 years undergoing v-PSG and without NDDs at baseline or within five years were included. Main outcome was NDDs diagnosis ≥five years after v-PSG.
RESULTS: Of 1454 patients assessed for eligibility, 999 (68.7%) met inclusion criteria (68.3% men; median age 54.9 (IQR 33.9-62.7) years). Seventy-five patients (7.5%) developed NDDs and 924 (92.5%) remained disease-free after a median of 12.8 (IQR 9.9-14.6) years. After adjusting for demographic, sleep, and clinical covariates, one-percentage decrease in sleep efficiency, N3-, or REM-sleep was associated with 1.9%, 6.5%, or 5.2% increased risk of incident NDDs (HR 1.019, 1.065, 1.052). One-percentage decrease in wake within sleep period time represented a 2.2% reduced risk of incident NDDs (HR 0.978).

Isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) is the most specific marker of prodromal PD, but data on clinical subtyping of patients with iRBD remain scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to identify iRBD subtypes. We conducted comprehensive clinical assessments in 66 patients with polysomnography-proven iRBD, including motor and non-motor evaluations, and applied a two-step cluster analysis. Besides, we compared iRBD clusters to matched healthy controls and related the resulting cluster solution to cortical and subcortical grey matter volumes by voxel-based morphometry analysis. We identified two distinct subtypes of patients based on olfactory function, dominant electroencephalography frequency, amount of REM sleep without atonia, depressive symptoms, disease duration, and motor functions. One iRBD cluster (Cluster I, late onset-aggressive) was characterised by higher non-motor symptom burden despite shorter disease duration than the more benign subtype (Cluster II, early onset-benign). Motor functions were comparable between the clusters. Patients from Cluster I were significantly older at iRBD onset and exhibited a widespread reduction of cortical grey matter volume compared to patients from Cluster II. In conclusion, our findings suggest the existence of clinical subtypes already in the prodromal stage of PD.

However, the relationships of plasma cholesterol levels with Aβ and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burdens are not fully understood in Asians. Herein, we investigated the relationships between plasma cholesterol profile components and Aβ and CSVD burdens in a large, non-demented Korean cohort.
METHODS: We enrolled 1,175 non-demented participants (456 with unimpaired cognition [CU] and 719 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) aged ≥ 45 years who underwent Aβ PET at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea. We performed linear regression analyses with each cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], and triglyceride) level as a predictor and each image marker (Aβ uptake on PET, white matter hyperintensity [WMH] volume, and hippocampal volume) as an outcome after controlling for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Increased LDL-c levels (β = 0.014 to 0.115, p = 0.013) were associated with greater Aβ uptake, independent of the APOE e4 allele genotype and lipid-lowering medication. Decreased HDL-c levels (β =  - 0.133 to - 0.006, p = 0.032) were predictive of higher WMH volumes. Increased LDL-c levels were also associated with decreased hippocampal volume (direct effect β =  - 0.053, p = 0.040), which was partially mediated by Aβ uptake (indirect effect β =  - 0.018, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that increased LDL-c and decreased HDL-c levels are important risk factors for Aβ and CSVD burdens, respectively.

The key exclusion criteria included neurologic disorder, surgical menopause, and recent use of hormonal or nonhormonal vasomotor symptom treatment. Women underwent 24 hours of ambulatory skin conductance monitoring to assess vasomotor symptoms. Plasma concentrations of Alzheimer disease biomarkers, including amyloid β 42-to-amyloid β 40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (181 and 231), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light, were measured using a single-molecule array (Simoa) technology. Associations between vasomotor symptoms and Alzheimer disease biomarkers were assessed via linear regression models adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, education, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E4 status. Additional models adjusted for estradiol and sleep.
RESULTS: A total of 248 (mean age, 59.06 years; 81% White; 99% postmenopausal status) of enrolled MsBrain participants contributed data. Objectively assessed vasomotor symptoms occurring during sleep were associated with significantly lower amyloid β 42/amyloid β 40, (beta, -.0010 [standard error, .0004]; P=.018; multivariable), suggestive of greater brain amyloid β pathology. The findings remained significant after additional adjustments for estradiol and sleep.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the potential causal association between A-to-I editing and PD, and to assess whether changes in A-to-I editing were associated with cognitive progression in PD.
METHODS: The RNA-seq data from 380 PD patients and 178 healthy controls in the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative cohort was used to quantify A-to-I editing sites. We performed cis-RNA editing quantitative trait loci analysis and a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study by integrating genome-wide association studies to infer the potential causality between A-to-I editing and PD pathogenesis. The potential causal A-to-I editing sites were further confirmed by Summary-data-based MR analysis. Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to characterize the association between longitudinal A-to-I editing and cognitive progression in patients with PD.
RESULTS: We identified 17 potential causal A-to-I editing sites for PD and indicated that genetic risk variants may contribute to the risk of PD through A-to-I editing. These A-to-I editing sites were located in genes NCOR1, KANSL1 and BST1. Moreover, we observed 57 sites whose longitudinal A-to-I editing levels correlated with cognitive progression in PD.
CONCLUSIONS: We found potential causal A-to-I editing sites for PD onset and longitudinal changes of A-to-I editing were associated with cognitive progression in PD.

In this work, we extended the competing-risk random survival forests to handle such endogenous longitudinal predictors when predicting event probabilities. The method, implemented in the R package DynForest, internally transforms the time-dependent predictors at each node of each tree into time-fixed features (using mixed models) that can then be used as splitting candidates. The final individual event probability is computed as the average of leaf-specific Aalen-Johansen estimators over the trees. Using simulations, we compared the performances of DynForest to accurately predict an event with (i) a joint modeling alternative when considering two longitudinal predictors only, and with (ii) a regression calibration method that ignores the informative truncation by the event when dealing with a large number of longitudinal predictors.

We used baseline ventricular CSF to explore associations to outcome, after shunting, of biomarkers selected to reflect a range of pathophysiological processes.
METHODS: In 119 consecutive patients with iNPH, the iNPH scale was used before and after shunt surgery to quantify outcome. Ventricular CSF was collected perioperatively and analyzed for biomarkers of astrogliosis, axonal, amyloid and tau pathology, and synaptic dysfunction: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL40/CHI3L1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) neurofilament light (NfL), amyloid beta 38 (Aβ38), Aβ40, Aβ42, amyloid beta 42/40 ratio (Aβ42/40), soluble amyloid precursor protein alfa (sAPPα), sAPPβ, total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and neurogranin.

METHODS: Children with DS and SDB (n = 44) and TD children matched for age, sex and SDB severity underwent overnight polysomnography. Fast or Slow sleep spindles were identified manually during N2/N3 sleep. Spindle activity was characterized as spindle number, density (number of spindles/h) and intensity (density × average duration) on central (C) and frontal (F) electrodes. Parents completed the Child Behavior Check List and OSA-18 questionnaires.
RESULTS: In children with DS, spindle activity was lower compared to TD children for F Slow and F Slow&Fast spindles combined (p < 0.001 for all). Furthermore, there were no correlations between spindle activity and CBCL subscales; however, spindle activity for C Fast and C Slow&Fast was negatively correlated with OSA-18 emotional symptoms and caregiver concerns and C Fast activity was also negatively correlated with daytime function and total problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced spindle activity in children with DS may underpin the increased sleep disruption and negative effects of SDB on quality of life and behavior.

However, the contribution of specific markers of vascular disease is unclear and, as a consequence, optimal prevention strategies remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To disentangle the causal relation of several key vascular traits to dementia risk: (i) white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, a highly prevalent imaging marker of covert cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD); (ii) clinical stroke; and (iii) blood pressure (BP), the leading risk factor for cSVD and stroke, for which efficient therapies exist.

DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study first explored the association of genetically determined WMH, BP levels and stroke risk with AD using summary-level data from large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. Second, leveraging individual-level data from large longitudinal population-based cohorts and biobanks with prospective dementia surveillance, the association of weighted genetic risk scores (wGRSs) for WMH, BP, and stroke with incident all-cause-dementia was explored using Cox-proportional hazard and multi-state models.

The current study aimed to investigate the association between different BPV measures (short- and mid-term BPV including circadian patterns) and cognitive functioning as well as vascular stiffness measures to better understand the role that BPV plays in cognitive impairment.
METHODS: 70 older adults (60-80-year-olds) without dementia completed a cognitive test battery and had their blood pressure (BP) assessed via a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor (divided into sleep and wake for short-term BPV) and 4-day morning and evening home-based BP monitor (for day-to-day BPV). Arterial stiffness was evaluated via pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity (PWV) and cerebrovascular pulsatility was assessed via transcranial doppler sonography of the middle cerebral arteries.
RESULTS: High systolic as well as diastolic short- and mid-term BPV were associated with poorer cognitive functioning, independent of the mean BP. Higher short-term BPV was associated with poorer attention and psychomotor speed, whilst day-to-day BPV was negatively linked with executive functioning. Circadian BP patterns (dipping and morning BP surge) showed no significant relationships with cognition after adjusting for covariates. Higher systolic short-term BPV was associated with higher arterial stiffness (PWV) and higher diastolic day-to-day BPV was linked with lower arterial stiffness. No significant associations between BPV measures and cerebrovascular pulsatility were present.

As expected, all pTau markers were increased in FTLD-Tau cases compared to controls. pSer356 expression was greatest in FTLD-MAPT cases vs. controls (P < 0.0001), whereas the expression of other markers was highest in PiD. PSP with FTD consistently had a lower pTau protein load compared to PiD across tau epitopes. The only microglial marker increased in FTLD-Tau was CD16 (P = 0.0292) and specifically in FTLD-MAPT cases (P = 0.0150). However several associations were detected between pTau epitopes and microglia, supporting an interplay between them. GFAP expression was increased in FTLD-Tau (P = 0.0345) with the highest expression in PiD (P = 0.0019), while ALDH1L1 was unchanged. Markers of astrocyte glutamate cycling function were reduced in FTLD-tau (P = 0.0075; PiD: P < 0.0400) implying astrocyte reactivity associated with a decreased glutamate cycling activity which was further associated with pTau expression. Of the inflammatory proteins assessed in the brain, five chemokines were upregulated in PiD cases (P < 0.0400), consistent with the recruitment of CD4+ (P = 0.0109) and CD8+ (P = 0.0014) T cells. Of note, the CD8+ T cell infiltration was associated with pTau epitopes and microglial and astrocytic markers. Our results highlight that FTLD-tau is associated with astrocyte reactivity, remarkably little activation of microglia, but involvement of adaptive immunity in the form of chemokine-driven recruitment of T lymphocytes.","2023",,"Brain",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Our objective was to examine whether low ALT (Alanine-aminotranferase), a surrogate marker for sarcopenia, is associated with worse clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: We reviewed cases of COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital, during three COVID-19 waves and examined correlations between ALT and mortality using crude, univariate and multivariate analysis for age, gender, hypertension, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Congestive heart failure.
RESULTS: 357 patients were included in this analysis. Median age was 69, 54% were males. Median ALT was 19 IU/L. During follow-up, 73 (20%) died.

Early detection of patients in risk of dementia could allow for preventative treatment. Hence, this study aimed to investigate RAO as an independent biomarker of incident dementia.
METHODS: This study was a nationwide, 20-year longitudinal cohort study in Denmark with inclusion from 1998 to 2020 and follow up until the end of 2022. We identified 2 205 159 individuals aged 65 or older through the Danish national health registers and monitored RAO (exposure) and dementia (outcome) status. We calculated incidence rate and performed a Cox regression analysis with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for RAO as a marker of dementia in a crude, a semi-adjusted (age and sex), and a fully adjusted model (furthermore adjusted for marital status and systemic comorbidity.) RESULTS: We identified 8 863 individuals with RAO. Incidence rates were higher among exposed compared to unexposed individuals (12.28 and 8.18 per 1000 person-years at risk, respectively). Individuals with RAO were more likely to be male and older at inclusion, to have hypertension, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes (p < 0.001).

However, it remains unknown whether cSS is just a marker of severe CAA pathology or may itself contribute to intracerebral hemorrhage risk and cognitive decline. cSS is a chronic manifestation of convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage and is neuropathologically characterized by iron deposits in the superficial cortical layers. We hypothesized that these iron deposits lead to local neuroinflammation, a potentially contributory pathway towards secondary tissue injury.
METHODS: Accordingly, we assessed the distribution of inflammatory markers in relation to cortical iron deposits in post-mortem tissue from CAA cases. Serial sections from the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes of nineteen autopsy cases with CAA were stained with Perls' Prussian blue (iron) and underwent immunohistochemistry against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, reactive astrocytes) and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68, activated microglia/macrophages). Digitized sections were uploaded to the cloud-based Aiforia
RESULTS: We observed a strong local relationship between cortical iron deposits and reactive astrocytes. Like cSS-related iron, reactive astrocytes were mainly found in the most superficial layers of the cortex. Although we observed iron within both astrocytes and activated microglia/macrophages on co-stains, there was no clear local relationship between the density of microglia/macrophages and the density of iron deposits.

METHODS: Data from 321 drug-naïve patients from the Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) were collected over a 2-year period. Patients were divided into the PD with arterial hypertension (AH) group (102 cases) with antihypertensive drugs, the PD with other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) group (60 cases) with antidiabetic and/or lipid-lowering drugs, and the pure PD group (159 cases) without CVRFs.

However, there have been limited efforts to combine existing findings to assess the utility of blood NfL as a biomarker of neurodegeneration for AD. In addition, we still need better insight into the specific aspects of neurodegeneration that are reflected by the elevated plasma or serum concentration of NfL. In this review, we survey the literature on the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between blood-based NfL levels and other, neuroimaging-based, indices of neurodegeneration in individuals on the Alzheimer's continuum. Then, based on the biomarker classification established by the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working group, we determine the utility of blood-based NfL as a marker for monitoring the disease status (i.e., monitoring biomarker) and predicting the severity of neurodegeneration in older adults with and without cognitive decline (i.e., a prognostic or a risk/susceptibility biomarker). The current findings suggest that blood NfL exhibits great promise as a monitoring biomarker because an increased NfL level in plasma or serum appears to reflect the current severity of atrophy, hypometabolism, and the decline of white matter integrity, particularly in the brain regions typically affected by AD. Longitudinal evidence indicates that blood NfL can be useful not only as a prognostic biomarker for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in patients with AD but also as a susceptibility/risk biomarker predicting the likelihood of abnormal alterations in brain structure and function in cognitively unimpaired individuals with a higher risk of developing AD (e.g., those with a higher amyloid beta). There are still limitations to current research, as discussed in this review. Nevertheless, the extant literature strongly suggests that blood NfL can serve as a valuable prognostic and susceptibility biomarker for AD-related neurodegeneration in clinical settings, as well as in research settings.","2023",,"Brain",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Medial temporal atrophy (MTA) is regarded as a common marker of dementia. The correlation between glycemic variability and MTA is unclear, and it has not been determined whether glycemic variability can be utilized as a biomarker of MTA and cognitive performance.
METHODS: The patients in a memory clinic who underwent brain MRI scans and cognitive assessments within the first week of their hospital visit, were enrolled. All participants underwent three fasting blood glucose and one HBA1c assessments on three self-selected days within 1 week of their first visit. The variability independent of the mean (VIM) was employed. Validated visual scales were used to rate the MTA results. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scales were employed to assess the cognitive functions of the participants. Spearman's correlation and regression models were used to examine the relationship between the MMSE and MoCA scales, and also determine the link between the MRI characteristics and cognitive status, where vascular risk factors, educational status, age, gender, and mean glucose parameters served as covariates.

METHODS: In a prospective cohort (Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Cohort study) consisting of 293 participants with small vessel disease (SVD), we assessed parkinsonian signs and incident parkinsonism over an 8-year follow-up. In addition, we reconstructed the white matter network followed by graph-theoretical analyses to compute the network metrics. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging markers for SVD were assessed.
RESULTS: We included 293 patients free of parkinsonism at baseline (2011), with a mean age 68.8 (standard deviation [SD] 8.4) years, and 130 (44.4%) were men. Nineteen participants (6.5%) developed parkinsonism during a median (SD) follow-up time of 8.3 years. Compared with participants without parkinsonism, those with all-cause parkinsonism had higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale (UPDRS) scores and lower global efficiency at baseline. Baseline global efficiency was associated with UPDRS motor scores in 2011 (β = -0.047, p < .001) and 2015 (β = -0.84, p < .001), as well as with the changes in UPDRS scores during the 4-year follow-up (β = -0.63, p = .004). In addition, at the regional level, we identified an inter-hemispheric disconnected network associated with an increased UPDRS motor score. Besides, lower global efficiency was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and vascular parkinsonism independent of SVD markers.

The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) degenerates early in PD and is crucial for cognitive function. The two main NBM white matter pathways include a lateral and medial trajectory. However, research is needed to determine which pathway, if any, are associated with PD-related cognitive decline.
METHODS: Thirty-seven PD patients with no mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were included in this study. Participants either developed MCI at 1-year follow up (PD MCI-Converters; n = 16) or did not (PD no-MCI; n = 21). Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the medial and lateral NBM tracts were extracted using probabilistic tractography. Between-group differences in MD and FA for each tract was compared using ANCOVA, controlling for age, sex, and disease duration. Control comparisons of the internal capsule MD and FA were also performed. Associations between baseline MD or FA and cognitive outcomes (working memory, psychomotor speed, delayed recall, and visuospatial function) were assessed using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: PD MCI-Converters had significantly greater MD and lower FA (p < .001) of both NBM tracts compared to PD no-MCI. No difference was found in the MD (p = .06) or FA (p = .31) of the control region. Trends were identified between: 1) lateral tract MD and FA with working memory decline; and 2) medial tract MD and reduced psychomotor speed.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced integrity of the NBM tracts is evident in PD patients up to one year prior to the development of MCI. Thus, deterioration of the NBM tracts in PD may be an early marker of those at risk of cognitive decline.","2023",,"Neurobiol Dis",,"other","Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150, White Matter, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, Cognition, FALSE, Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase reactant that mediates immune responses triggered by LPS and has been used as a blood marker for LPS. LBP has recently been indicated to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in small-scale retrospective case-control studies. We aimed to investigate the association between LBP blood levels with PD risk in a nested case-control study within a large European prospective cohort.
METHODS: A total of 352 incident PD cases (55% males) were identified and one control per case was selected, matched by age at recruitment, sex and study center. LBP levels in plasma collected at recruitment, which was on average 7.8 years before diagnosis of the cases, were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for one unit increase of the natural log of LBP levels and PD incidence by conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: Plasma LBP levels were higher in prospective PD cases compared to controls (median (interquartile range) 26.9 (18.1-41.0) vs. 24.7 (16.6-38.4) µg/ml). The OR for PD incidence per one unit increase of log LBP was elevated (1.46, 95% CI 0.98-2.19). This association was more pronounced among women (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.40-5.13) and overweight/obese subjects (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09-2.18).

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an inflammatory marker derived from astrocytes. Research has demonstrated the potential of plasma GFAP to forecast the progression to dementia in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). However, the predictive role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP on future cognitive transformation and alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated CSF biomarkers in newly diagnosed PD patients has not been investigated.
METHODS: 210 de novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were recruited. Cognitive progression in PD participants was evaluated using Cox regression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between baseline CSF GFAP and cognitive function and AD-related CSF biomarkers were evaluated using multiple linear regression and generalized linear mixed model.
RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age of PD participants was 60.85 ± 9.78 years, including 142 patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 68 PD-MCI patients. The average follow-up time was 6.42 ± 1.69 years. A positive correlation was observed between baseline CSF GFAP and age (β = 0.918, p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in baseline CSF GFAP levels between PD-NC and PD-MCI groups. Higher baseline CSF GFAP predicted greater global cognitive decline over time in early PD patients (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, β = - 0.013, p = 0.014). Furthermore, Cox regression showed that high baseline CSF GFAP levels were associated with a high risk of developing dementia over an 8-year period in the PD-NC group (adjusted HR = 3.070, 95% CI 1.119-8.418, p = 0.029). In addition, the baseline CSF GFAP was positively correlated with the longitudinal changes of not only CSF α-synuclein (β = 0.313, p < 0.001), but also CSF biomarkers associated with AD, namely, amyloid-β 42 (β = 0.147, p = 0.034), total tau (β = 0.337, p < 0.001) and phosphorylated tau (β = 0.408, p < 0.001).

Our aim was to determine whether HV, measured by manual or automatic segmentation, is associated with dementia risk and cognitive decline in participants with and without incident dementia.
METHODS: At baseline, 510 dementia-free participants from the French longitudinal ESPRIT cohort underwent magnetic resonance imaging. HV was measured by manual and by automatic segmentation (FreeSurfer 6.0). The presence of dementia and cognitive functions were investigated at each follow-up (2, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 15 years). Cox proportional hazards models and linear mixed models were used to assess the association of HV with dementia risk and with cognitive decline, respectively.
RESULTS: During the 15-years follow-up, 42 participants developed dementia. Reduced HV (regardless of the measurement method) was significantly associated with higher dementia risk and cognitive decline in the whole sample. However, only the automatically measured HV was associated with cognitive decline in dementia-free participants.

Despite being widely used as a lysosomal marker, the physiological functions of the LAMP proteins have long been overlooked. We show that LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 directly interact with and inhibit the activity of the lysosomal cation channel TMEM175, a key player in lysosomal pH homeostasis implicated in Parkinson's disease. This LAMP inhibition mitigates the proton conduction of TMEM175 and facilitates lysosomal acidification to a lower pH environment crucial for optimal hydrolase activity.

DM and PD are both age-associated diseases that are turning into epidemics worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that type 2 DM might be a risk factor of developing PD. However, scarce information about the link between type 1 DM (T1DM) and PD does exist. In this work, we have generated a Drosophila model of T1DM based on insulin deficiency to evaluate if T1DM could be a risk factor to trigger PD onset. As expected, model flies exhibited T1DM-related phenotypes such as insulin deficiency, increased content of carbohydrates and glycogen, and reduced activity of insulin signaling. Interestingly, our results also demonstrated that T1DM model flies presented locomotor defects as well as reduced levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (a marker of DA neurons) in brains, which are typical PD-related phenotypes. In addition, T1DM model flies showed elevated oxidative stress levels, which could be causative of DA neurodegeneration. Therefore, our results indicate that T1DM might be a risk factor of developing PD, and encourage further studies to shed light into the exact link between both diseases.","2023",,"J Exp Zool A Ecol Integr Physiol",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, Drosophila, FALSE, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Risk Factors, FALSE, Insulins, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Next, we investigated the impacts of AChEIs on RANKL-induced nuclear factor κB and NFATc1 activation and expression of osteoclast marker proteins CA-2, CTSK and NFATc1, and dissected the MAPK signaling in osteoclasts in vitro by using luciferase assay and Western blot. Finally, we assessed the in vivo efficacy of AChEIs using an ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis mouse model, which was analyzed using microcomputed tomography, in vivo osteoclast and osteoblast parameters were assessed using histomorphometry. We found that Donepezil and Rivastigmine inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and impaired osteoclastic bone resorption. Moreover, AChEIs reduced the RANKL-induced transcription of Nfatc1, and expression of osteoclast marker genes to varying degrees (mainly Donepezil and Rivastigmine but not Galantamine). Furthermore, AChEIs variably inhibited RANKL-induced MAPK signaling accompanied by downregulation of AChE transcription. Finally, AChEIs protected against OVX-induced bone loss mainly by inhibiting osteoclast activity. Taken together, AChEIs (mainly Donepezil and Rivastigmine) exerted a positive effect on bone protection by inhibiting osteoclast function through MAPK and NFATc1 signaling pathways through downregulating AChE.

DESIGN: Retrospective. Four cSVD neuroimaging markers were rated using validated visual scales: white matter hyperintensities, enlarged perivascular spaces, lacunes, and global cortical atrophy. We also calculated a cSVD total score. We employed linear regression models to model treatment response as a function of cSVD burden. We also ran correlation analyses to determine the association among cSVD burden and pre-treatment linguistic and non-linguistic cognition.
SETTING: Research clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: The study includes data from 30 chronic stroke patients with aphasia who received treatment for word finding difficulties and completed additional pre-treatment neuroimaging and behavioral assessments (N=30).
INTERVENTIONS: 120-minute sessions of anomia treatment 2 times per week for up to 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in accuracy on the treatment probes measured as a percentage (ie, change in accuracy percentage score=post-treatment accuracy percentage minus pre-treatment accuracy percentage).
RESULTS: Baseline cSVD burden predicted response to anomia treatment independently from demographic and stroke-related factors. Patients with lower cSVD burden exhibited enhanced rehabilitation response compared with those with higher cSVD burden (β=-6.816e-02, P=.019). cSVD burden was highly associated with nonverbal executive function at baseline (r=-0.49, P=.005): patients with lower cSVD burden exhibited higher performance on nonverbal executive function tasks compared with participants with higher cSVD burden.

The goal of this study was to investigate the protective role of a psychoactive substance like caffeine on hippocampal neurogenesis and memory functions in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced neurodegeneration in rats.
BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a natural CNS stimulant, belonging to the methylxanthine class, and is a widely consumed psychoactive substance. It is reported to abate the risk of various abnormalities that are cardiovascular system (CVS) related, cancer related, or due to metabolism dysregulation. Short-term caffeine exposure has been widely evaluated, but its chronic exposure is less explored and pursued. Several studies suggest a devastating role of caffeine in neurodegenerative disorders. However, the protective role of caffeine on neurodegeneration is still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we examined the effects of chronic caffeine administration on hippocampal neurogenesis in intracerebroventricular STZ injection induced memory dysfunction in rats. The chronic effect of caffeine on proliferation and neuronal fate determination of hippocampal neurons was evaluated by co-labeling of neurons by thymidine analogue BrdU that labels new born cells, DCX (a marker for immature neurons) and NeuN that labels mature neurons.
METHOD: STZ (1 mg/kg, 2 μl) was injected stereotaxically into the lateral ventricles (intracerebroventricular injection) once on day 1, followed by chronic treatment with caffeine (10 mg/kg, i.p) and donepezil (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Protective effect of caffeine on cognitive impairment and adult hippocampal neurogenesis was evaluated.
RESULT: Our findings show decreased oxidative stress burden and amyloid burden following caffeine administration in STZ lesioned SD rats. Further, double immunolabeling with bromodeoxyuridine+/doublecortin+ (BrdU+/DCX+) and bromodeoxyuridine+/ neuronal nuclei+ (BrdU+/NeuN+) has indicated that caffeine improved neuronal stem cell proliferation and long term survival in STZ lesioned rats.

Among individuals with a high or moderately high plasma p-tau181, integrating AD-GRS data significantly improved classification accuracy of amyloid PET positivity, including the finding that the combination of a high AD-GRS and high plasma p-tau181 outperformed p-tau181 alone in classifying amyloid PET positivity (88% versus 68%; P = 0.001). A machine learning approach incorporating plasma biomarkers, demographics and the AD-GRS was highly accurate in predicting amyloid PET levels (90% training set; 89% test set) and Shapley value analyses (an explainer method based in cooperative game theory) indicated that the AD-GRS and plasma biomarkers had differential importance in explaining amyloid deposition across individuals.

Excessive noise exposure is the most common cause of acquired peripheral hearing loss in modern society. This study was designed to investigate the impact of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on cognition, with a focus on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region that is involved in both auditory and cognitive processes and is highly affected in patients with cognitive impairment. Adult C57BL/6 J mice were randomly assigned to a control group and seven noise groups: 0HPN, 12HPN, 1DPN, 3DPN, 7DPN, 14DPN, and 28DPN, which were exposed to broadband noise at a 123 dB sound pressure level (SPL) for 2 h and sacrificed immediately (0 h), 12 h, or 1, 3, 7, 14, or 28 days post-noise exposure (HPN, DPN), respectively. Hearing assessment, behavioral tests, and neuromorphological studies in the mPFC were performed in control and 28DPN mice. All experimental animals were included in the time-course analysis of serum corticosterone (CORT) levels and mPFC microglial morphology. The results illustrated that noise exposure induced early-onset transient serum CORT elevation and permanent moderate-to-severe hearing loss in mice. 28DPN mice, in which permanent NIHL has been verified, exhibited impaired performance in temporal order object recognition tasks concomitant with reduced structural complexity of mPFC pyramidal neurons. The time-course immunohistochemical analysis in the mPFC revealed significantly higher morphological microglial activation at 14 and 28 DPN, preceded by a remarkably higher amount of microglial engulfed postsynaptic marker PSD95 at 7 DPN. Additionally, lipid accumulation in microglia was observed in 7DPN, 14DPN and 28DPN mice, suggesting a driving role of lipid handling deficits following excessive phagocytosis of synaptic elements in delayed and sustained microglial abnormalities. These findings provide fundamentally novel information concerning mPFC-related cognitive impairment in mice with NIHL and empirical evidence suggesting the involvement of microglial malfunction in the mPFC neurodegenerative consequences of NIHL.","2023",,"Neurobiol Dis"," This study was designed to investigate the impact of noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) on cognition , with a focus on the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) , a brain region that is involved in both auditory and cognitive processes and is highly affected in patients with cognitive impairment ","other","Mice, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Microglia, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Memory Disorders, FALSE, Lipids, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"37270543","APOE4 carrier status determines association between white matter disease and grey matter atrophy in early-stage dementia.","Vipin A","BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities, a neuroimaging marker of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease and apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) allele, are important dementia risk factors. However, APOE4 as a key effect modifier in the relationship between white matter hyperintensities and grey matter volume needs further exploration.
METHODS: One hundred ninety-two early-stage dementia (including mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia) and 259 cognitively unimpaired participants from a neurocognitive research cohort with neuroimaging data, APOE genotyping, and neuropsychological assessments were studied. We investigated independent and interactive effects of white matter hyperintensities and APOE4 on whole-brain voxel-wise grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (uncorrected p < 0.001; minimum cluster size = 100 voxels). We further assessed interactive effects between APOE4 and white matter hyperintensities on global cognition, memory, and executive function in early-stage dementia and cognitively unimpaired participants.
RESULTS: Independent of APOE4 status, higher white matter hyperintensity load was associated with greater grey matter atrophy across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes in cognitively unimpaired and early-stage dementia subjects. However, interaction analyses and independent sample analyses revealed that APOE4 non-carriers demonstrated greater white matter hyperintensity-associated grey matter atrophy compared to APOE4 carriers in both cognitively unimpaired and early-stage dementia groups. Additional confirmatory analyses among APOE4 non-carriers demonstrated that white matter hyperintensities resulted in widespread grey matter loss. Analyses of cognitive function demonstrated that higher white matter hyperintensity load was associated with worse global (Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and executive function (Color Trails 2) in APOE4 non-carriers compared to APOE4 carriers in early-stage dementia but not cognitively unimpaired participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between white matter hyperintensities and grey matter loss is more pronounced in APOE4 non-carriers than APOE4 carriers in the cognitively unimpaired and early-stage dementia stages. Furthermore, white matter hyperintensity presence results in poorer executive function in APOE4 non-carriers compared to APOE4 carriers.

However, little is known about how adolescents with IBD will affect their cognitive ability as adults. The hippocampus, which is crucial for memory and adult neurogenesis, is closely associated with modulation of cognitive processes. Using a low kDa dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 5 kDa)-induced chronic colitis (mild chronic colitis) mice model in adolescent mice, we investigated the effects of mild chronic colitis on cognitive functions and hippocampal neurogenesis from adolescent mice to adult mice.
METHODS: We induced DSS-induced mild chronic colitis in C57BL/6J male mice by multiple-cycle administration of 1%-2% DSS in autoclaved drinking water. Mice were subjected to novel-object recognition and Y-maze tests. Neurogenesis markers and neuroinflammation-related proteins in the hippocampus of mice were measured. Tight junction proteins in the colon of mice were measured.
RESULTS: Mild chronic colitis induced cognitive impairment and decreased adult neurogenesis. Notably, we found a positive correlation with the protein levels between tight junction protein, ZO-1, in the colon and mature neuron marker, NeuN, in the hippocampus. Moreover, mild chronic colitis leads to hippocampal neuroinflammation in adolescent mice.

This disease burden is commonly described as hyperintense areas in the cerebral white matter, as seen on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging data. Studies have demonstrated associations with various cognitive impairments, neurological diseases, and neuropathologies, as well as clinical and risk factors, such as age, sex, and hypertension. Due to their heterogeneous appearance in location and size, studies have started to investigate spatial distributions and patterns, beyond summarizing this cerebrovascular disease burden in a single metric-its volume. Here, we review the evidence of association of white matter hyperintensity spatial patterns with its risk factors and clinical diagnoses.
DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement. We used the standards for reporting vascular changes on neuroimaging criteria to construct a search string for literature search on PubMed. Studies written in English from the earliest records available until January 31st, 2023, were eligible for inclusion if they reported on spatial patterns of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin.
RESULTS: A total of 380 studies were identified by the initial literature search, of which 41 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies included cohorts based on mild cognitive impairment (15/41), Alzheimer's disease (14/41), Dementia (5/41), Parkinson's disease (3/41), and subjective cognitive decline (2/41). Additionally, 6 of 41 studies investigated cognitively normal, older cohorts, two of which were population-based, or other clinical findings such as acute ischemic stroke or reduced cardiac output. Cohorts ranged from 32 to 882 patients/participants [median cohort size 191.5 and 51.6% female (range: 17.9-81.3%)]. The studies included in this review have identified spatial heterogeneity of WMHs with various impairments, diseases, and pathologies as well as with sex and (cerebro)vascular risk factors.

,"37221566","Associations between circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA, inflammatory markers, and cognitive and physical outcomes in community dwelling older adults.","Nidadavolu LS","BACKGROUND: Dementia and frailty are common age-related syndromes often linked to chronic inflammation. Identifying the biological factors and pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation is crucial for developing new therapeutic targets. Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) has been proposed as an immune stimulator and potential predictor of mortality in acute illnesses. Dementia and frailty are both associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired cellular energetics, and cell death. The size and abundance of ccf-mtDNA fragments may indicate the mechanism of cell death: long fragments typically result from necrosis, while short fragments arise from apoptosis. We hypothesize that increased levels of necrosis-associated long ccf-mtDNA fragments and inflammatory markers in serum are linked to declines in cognitive and physical function, as well as increased mortality risk.
RESULTS: Our study of 672 community-dwelling older adults revealed that inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein, soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 [sTNFR1], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) positively correlated with ccf-mtDNA levels in serum. Although cross-sectional analysis revealed no significant associations between short and long ccf-mtDNA fragments, longitudinal analysis demonstrated a connection between higher long ccf-mtDNA fragments (necrosis-associated) and worsening composite gait scores over time. Additionally, increased mortality risk was observed only in individuals with elevated sTNFR1 levels.
CONCLUSION: In a community dwelling cohort of older adults, there are cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between ccf-mtDNA and sTNFR1 with impaired physical and cognitive function and increased hazard of death. This work suggests a role for long ccf-mtDNA as a blood-based marker predictive of future physical decline.","2023",,"Immun Ageing",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We assessed the association between circulating levels of myostatin at Year 1 and plasma levels of β-amyloid 42/40 at Year 2, a marker of AD pathology, in a biracial cohort of older adults.
METHODS: We studied 403 community-dwelling older adults enrolled in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study from Memphis, Tennessee, and Pittsburgh, PA. Mean age was 73.8 ± 3 years; 54% were female; and 52% were Black. Serum myostatin levels were measured at Year 1, plasma β-amyloid 42/40 levels in Year 2 (higher ratio indicating lower amyloid load). Multivariable linear regression analyses tested the association of serum myostatin with plasma levels of β-amyloid 42/40 adjusted for computed-tomography-derived thigh muscle cross-sectional area, demographics, APOe4 allele, and risk factors for dementia. We tested for 2-way.interactions between myostatin and race or sex; results were stratified by race and sex.

The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) degenerates early in PD and is crucial for cognitive function. The two main NBM white matter pathways include a lateral and medial trajectory. However, research is needed to determine which pathway, if any, are associated with PD-related cognitive decline.
METHODS: Thirty-seven PD patients with no mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were included in this study. Participants either developed MCI at 1-year follow up (PD MCI-Converters; n=16) or did not (PD no-MCI; n=21). Mean diffusivity (MD) of the medial and lateral NBM tracts were extracted using probabilistic tractography. Between-group differences in MD for each tract was compared using ANCOVA, controlling for age, sex, and disease duration. Control comparisons of the internal capsule MD were also performed. Associations between baseline MD and cognitive outcomes (working memory, psychomotor speed, delayed recall, and visuospatial function) were assessed using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: PD MCI-Converters had significantly greater MD of both NBM tracts compared to PD no-MCI (p<.001). No difference was found in the control region (p=.06). Trends were identified between: 1) lateral tract MD, poorer visuospatial performance (p=.05) and working memory decline (p=.04); and 2) medial tract MD and reduced psychomotor speed (p=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced integrity of the NBM tracts is evident in PD patients up to one year prior to the development of MCI. Thus, deterioration of the NBM tracts in PD may be an early marker of those at risk of cognitive decline.","2023",,"medRxiv",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we harmonized and pooled data for 17,194 older adults from nine population-based cohorts of eight countries. These studies conducted face-to-face diagnostic interviews, physical and neurological examinations, and neuropsychological assessments to diagnose dementia. We investigated the associations of maternal and paternal history of dementia with the risk of dementia and its subtypes in offspring.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 72.8 ± 7.9 years and 59.2% were female. Parental history of dementia was associated with higher risk of dementia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.86) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.31-2.26), but not with the risk of non-AD.

We surveyed the current state of PRSs for various diseases, including breast cancer, diabetes, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson disease, with an extra focus upon the potential improvement of clinical scores by their combination with PRSs. We observed that the diagnostic and prognostic performance of PRSs alone is consistently low, as expected. Moreover, combining a PRS with a clinical score at best led to moderate improvement of the power of either risk marker. Despite the large number of PRSs reported in the scientific literature, prospective studies of their clinical utility, particularly of the PRS-associated improvement of standard screening or therapeutic procedures, are still rare.

We have previously identified hsa-miR-4639-5p as the post-transcriptional regulator of DJ-1. Increased expression of hsa-miR-4639-5p reduced DJ-1 level and increased oxidative stress leading to neuronal death. Therefore, understanding the detailed mechanisms by which hsa-miR-4639-5p expression is regulated will not only facilitate diagnosis but also inform the pathogenesis of PD. We examined hsa-miR-4639-5 in either the plasma or exosomes derived from the central nervous system (CNS) neurons of PD patients and healthy controls. We showed that CNS-derived exosomes gave rise to the increased plasma hsa-miR-4639-5p in PD patients, pointing to hsa-miR-4639-5p dysregulation in the brain of PD patients. Using a dual-luciferase assay and a CRISPR-Cas9 system, we identified a core promoter of hsa-miR-4639 (-560 to -275 upstream the transcriptional starting site) of the gene for myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein. A polymorphism in the core promoter (rs760632 G>A) could enhance hsa-miR-4639-5p expression and increase PD risk. Furthermore, using MethylTarget™ assay, ChIP-qPCR, and specific inhibitors, we demonstrated that hsa-miR4639-5p expression was regulated by HDAC11-mediated histone acetylation but not DNA methylation/demethylation. Taken together, our study provides evidence that hsa-miR-4639-5p is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for PD.

OBJECTIVE: Here, gustatory function is investigated as a potential predictor for an increased risk of progressive cognitive decline indicating higher AD risk in SCD.
METHODS: Measures of smell and taste perception as well as neuropsychological data were assessed in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD): Subgroups with an increased likelihood of the progression to preclinical AD (SCD+) and those with a lower likelihood (SCD-) were compared to healthy controls (HC), patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD patients.

METHODS: In the US Health and Retirement Study (n=5,143), serum CRP was measured at baseline (2006, 2008 waves). Incident dementia was classified by cognitive tests over a six-year follow-up. Self-reported racialized categories were a proxy for exposure to the racialization process.

RESULTS: The 6-year cumulative incidence of dementia was 15.5%.

In humans, intermittent fasting has been studied in hypertension, diabetes, and related conditions, but, to date, not as a strategy to reduce the risk of emergent dementia. In this scoping review, the relevance of intermittent fasting as a potential preventive intervention for Alzheimer's dementia is explored.
BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of calorie restriction have been documented in animals and humans. Decreased oxidative stress damage and attenuated inflammatory responses are associated with intermittent fasting. These changes have a favorable impact on the vascular endothelium and stress-induced cellular adaptation.
RESULTS: Physiological alterations associated with fasting have profound implications for pathological mechanisms associated with dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Compared with ad libitum feeding, caloric restriction in animals was associated with a reduction in β-amyloid accumulation, which is the cardinal pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies have demonstrated synaptic adaptations in the hippocampus and enhanced cognitive function after fasting, consistent with these theoretical frameworks. Furthermore, vascular dysfunction plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease pathology, and intermittent fasting promotes vascular health.

Previous works have shown that this property is altered in patients with Parkinson's disease, such that their gait pattern corresponds to a more random process. Here, we adapted a model of gait control to interpret the reduction in LRA that characterized patients in a computational framework. Gait regulation was modeled as a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian control problem where the objective was to maintain a fixed velocity through the coordinated regulation of stride duration and length. This objective offers a degree of redundancy in the way the controller can maintain a given velocity, resulting in the emergence of LRA. In this framework, the model suggested that patients exploited less the task redundancy, likely to compensate for an increased stride-to-stride variability. Furthermore, we used this model to predict the potential benefit of an active orthosis on the gait pattern of patients. The orthosis was embedded in the model as a low-pass filter on the series of stride parameters. We show in simulations that, with a suitable level of assistance, the orthosis could help patients recovering a gait pattern with LRA comparable to that of healthy controls. Assuming that the presence of LRA in a stride series is a marker of healthy gait control, our study provides a rationale for developing gait assistance technology to reduce the fall risk associated with Parkinson's disease.","2023",,"IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng"," Gait regulation was modeled as a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian control problem where the objective was to maintain a fixed velocity through the coordinated regulation of stride duration and length ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: This study is ancillary to the prospective multicentre Biomarker of AmyLoid pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk cohort that enrolled participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who were examined for conversion to dementia for up to 3 years. Plasma Ptau-181 was measured using the ultrasensitive Quanterix HD-X assay.
RESULTS: Among 476 MCI participants, 67% were amyloid positive (Aβ+) at baseline and 30% developed dementia. Plasma P-tau181 was higher in the Aβ+ population (3.9 (SD 1.4) vs 2.6 (SD 1.4) pg/mL) and in MCI that converted to dementia (3.8 (SD 1.5) vs 2.9 (SD 1.4) pg/mL). The addition of plasma P-tau181 to a logistic regression model combining age, sex, APOEε4 status and Mini Mental State Examination improved predictive performance (areas under the curve 0.691-0.744 for conversion and 0.786-0.849 for Aβ+). The Kaplan-Meier curve of conversion to dementia, according to the tertiles of plasma P-tau181, revealed a significant predictive value (Log rank p<0.0001) with an HR of 3.8 (95% CI 2.5 to 5.8). In addition, patients with plasma P-Tau(181) ≤2.32 pg/mL had a conversion rate of less than 20% over a 3-year period. Using a linear regression approach, chronic kidney disease, creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate were independently associated with plasma P-tau181 concentrations.

Future clinical AD trials on disease modifying drugs will require a shift to very early identification of individuals at risk of dementia. Hence, digital markers of language and speech may offer a method for screening of at-risk populations that are at the earliest stages of AD, eventually in combination with advanced machine learning. To this end, we developed a screening battery consisting of speech-based neurocognitive tests. The automated test performs a remote primary screening using a simple telephone.
OBJECTIVES: PROSPECT-AD aims to validate speech biomarkers for identification of individuals with early signs of AD and monitor their longitudinal course through access to well-phenotyped cohorts.
DESIGN: PROSPECT-AD leverages ongoing cohorts such as EPAD (UK), DESCRIBE and DELCODE (Germany), and BioFINDER Primary Care (Sweden) and Beta-AARC (Spain) by adding a collection of speech data over the telephone to existing longitudinal follow-ups. Participants at risk of dementia are recruited from existing parent cohorts across Europe to form an AD 'probability-spectrum', i.e., individuals with a low risk to high risk of developing AD dementia. The characterization of cognition, biomarker and risk factor (genetic and environmental) status of each research participants over time combined with audio recordings of speech samples will provide a well-phenotyped population for comparing novel speech markers with current gold standard biomarkers and cognitive scores.
PARTICIPANTS: N= 1000 participants aged 50 or older will be included in total, with a clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) score of 0 or 0.5. The study protocol is planned to run according to sites between 12 and 18 months.
MEASUREMENTS: The speech protocol includes the following neurocognitive tests which will be administered remotely: Word List [Memory Function], Verbal Fluency [Executive Functions] and spontaneous free speech [Psychological and/ or behavioral symptoms]. Speech features on the linguistic and paralinguistic level will be extracted from the recordings and compared to data from CSF and blood biomarkers, neuroimaging, neuropsychological evaluations, genetic profiles, and family history. Primary candidate marker from speech will be a combination of most significant features in comparison to biomarkers as reference measure. Machine learning and computational techniques will be employed to identify the most significant speech biomarkers that could represent an early indicator of AD pathology. Furthermore, based on the analysis of speech performances, models will be trained to predict cognitive decline and disease progression across the AD continuum.

BPV was assessed using standard deviations (SDs) of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for each period - 24 h, daytime, and night-time.
RESULTS: The study included 204 participants, 102 in each group. Mean age 66 years old and 59% man. Most PD patients presented mild symptoms (mean Hoehn&Yahr 2.04). Daytime BPV was significantly higher in PD patients (SD SBP 14.1 mmHg vs 12.96 mmHg and SD DBP 9.39 mmHg vs 8.29 mmHg), but 24 h and night-time BPV were non-significantly increased. PD patients present non-significant higher night-time SBP (114 mmHg vs 110 mmHg) as well as higher frequency of non-dippers or reverse dippers BP profiles (51% vs 36%).

However, most existing MTSCCA methods are neither supervised nor capable of distinguishing the shared patterns of multi-modal imaging QTs from the specific patterns.
METHODS: A new diagnosis-guided MTSCCA (DDG-MTSCCA) with parameter decomposition and graph-guided pairwise group lasso penalty was proposed. Specifically, the multi-tasking modeling paradigm enables us to comprehensively identify risk genetic loci by jointly incorporating multi-modal imaging QTs. The regression sub-task was raised to guide the selection of diagnosis-related imaging QTs. To reveal the diverse genetic mechanisms, the parameter decomposition and different constraints were utilized to facilitate the identification of modality-consistent and -specific genotypic variations. Besides, a network constraint was added to find out meaningful brain networks. The proposed method was applied to synthetic data and two real neuroimaging data sets respectively from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) and Parkinson's progression marker initiative (PPMI) databases.
RESULTS: Compared with the competitive methods, the proposed method exhibited higher or comparable canonical correlation coefficients (CCCs) and better feature selection results. In particular, in the simulation study, DDG-MTSCCA showed the best anti-noise ability and achieved the highest average hit rate, about 25% higher than MTSCCA. On the real data of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), our method obtained the highest average testing CCCs, about 40% ∼ 50% higher than MTSCCA. Especially, our method could select more comprehensive feature subsets, and the top five SNPs and imaging QTs were all disease-related. The ablation experimental results also demonstrated the significance of each component in the model, i.e., the diagnosis guidance, parameter decomposition, and network constraint.

Here, we used quantitative proteomics to study the role of PHD Finger Protein 8 (PHF8), a histone demethylating enzyme found to be mutated in X-linked intellectual disability and identified as a genetic marker of PD, in regulating the expression of PD-related synaptic plasticity proteins. Amongst the list of proteins found to be affected by PHF8 knockdown were Parkinson's-disease-associated SNCA (alpha synuclein) and PD-linked genes DNAJC6 (auxilin), SYNJ1 (synaptojanin 1), and the PD risk gene SH3GL2 (endophilin A1). Findings in this study show that depletion of PHF8 in cortical neurons affects the activity-induced expression of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptic structure, vesicular release and membrane trafficking, spanning the spectrum of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic transmission. Given that the depletion of even a single chromatin-modifying enzyme can affect synaptic protein expression in such a concerted manner, more in-depth studies will be needed to show whether such a mechanism can be exploited as a potential disease-modifying therapeutic drug target in PD.","2023",,"Biomedicines",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Current PD prediction models do not consider interdependencies of single predictors, lack differentiation by subtypes of prodromal PD, and may be limited and potentially biased by confounding factors, unspecific assessment methods and restricted access to comprehensive marker data of prospective cohorts. We used prospective data of 18 established risk and prodromal markers of PD in 1178 healthy, PD-free individuals and 24 incident PD cases collected longitudinally in the Tübingen evaluation of Risk factors for Early detection of NeuroDegeneration (TREND) study at 4 visits over up to 10 years. We employed artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and quantify PD marker interdependencies via a Bayesian network (BN) with probabilistic confidence estimation using bootstrapping. The BN was employed to generate a synthetic cohort and individual marker profiles. Robust interdependencies were observed for BN edges from age to subthreshold parkinsonism and urinary dysfunction, sex to substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, depression, non-smoking and to constipation; depression to symptomatic hypotension and excessive daytime somnolence; solvent exposure to cognitive deficits and to physical inactivity; and non-smoking to physical inactivity. Conversion to PD was interdependent with prior subthreshold parkinsonism, sex and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity. Several additional interdependencies with lower probabilistic confidence were identified. Synthetic subjects generated via the BN based representation of the TREND study were realistic as assessed through multiple comparison approaches of real and synthetic data.

Thus, it is crucial for both clinicians and stroke survivors to be provided with timely and accurate prognostication of post-stroke depression (PSD) and post-stroke dementia (PSDem). Several biomarkers regarding stroke patients' propensity to develop PSD and PSDem have been implemented so far, leukoaraiosis (LA) being among them. The purpose of the present study was to review all available work published within the last decade dealing with pre-existing LA as a predictor of depression (PSD) and cognitive dysfunction (cognitive impairment or PSDem) in stroke patients.

Only full-text articles published in the English language were included. Thirty-four articles were traced and are included in the present review. LA burden, serving as a surrogate marker of ""brain frailty"" among stroke patients, appears to be able to offer significant information about the possibility of developing PSD or cognitive dysfunction.

METHODS: At baseline, 121 participants aged 72-91 years were tested in PM using a validated PM task, Virtual Week, which included time- and event-based tasks presented with varying regularity. Responses were scored ""Correct"" if completed accurately and ""Missed"" if the target was not remembered at any time. Measures of cognition were taken at baseline and 2-year intervals over 8 years. Dementia diagnoses were made by expert consensus panels using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Linear mixed models and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the data, controlling for potential confounds.
RESULTS: Both decreased PM accuracy and missed PM responses were associated with rate of cognitive decline measured by Mini-Mental State Examination over 8 years and global cognitive decline over 4 years. Risk of incident dementia increased with poorer baseline PM ability and missed responses. These effects remained significant after controlling for baseline cognition and were strongest for event-based and regular PM tasks.
DISCUSSION: PM is a sensitive early marker of future cognitive decline and risk of incident dementia. PM tasks supported by spontaneous retrieval (event-based) and those with lower retrospective memory demands (regular tasks) function as particularly sensitive predictors. In other words, deficits in performing less effortful PM tasks best predicted cognitive decline.

However, the features of substantia nigra damage in GBA pathogenic variant carriers remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the microstructural changes in the substantia nigra in non-manifesting GBA pathogenic variant carriers (GBA-NMC) and PD patients with GBA pathogenic variant (GBA-PD) with free-water imaging.
METHODS: First, we compared free water values in the posterior substantia nigra between non-manifesting non-carriers (NMNC, n = 29), GBA-NMC (n = 26), and GBA-PD (n = 16). Then, free water values in the posterior substantia nigra were compared between GBA-PD and early- (n = 19) and late-onset (n = 40) idiopathic PD (iPD) patients. Furthermore, we examined whether the baseline free water values could predict the progressions of clinical symptoms.
RESULTS: The free water values in the posterior substantia nigra were significantly higher in the GBA-NMC and GBA-PD groups compared to NMNC, and were significantly increased in the GBA-PD group than both early- and late-onset iPD. Free water values in the posterior substantia nigra could predict the progression of anxiety and cognitive decline in GBA-NMC and GBA-PD groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that free water values are elevated in the substantia nigra and predict the development of non-motor symptoms in GBA-NMC and GBA-PD.

Copper occupational exposure increases Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Previously, we determined the mechanisms by which copper induces dopaminergic cell death in vitro. The copper transporter protein 1 (Ctr1) overexpression led to intracellular glutathione depletion potentiating caspase-3 mediated cell death; oxidative stress was primarily cytosolic, and Nrf2 was upregulated mediating an antioxidant response; and protein ubiquitination, AMPK-Ulk1 signaling, p62, and Atg5-dependent autophagy were increased as a protective mechanism. However, the effect of chronic copper exposure on the neurodegenerative process has not been explored in vivo. We aimed to elucidate whether prolonged copper treatment reproduces PD features and mechanisms during aging. Throughout 40 weeks, C57BL/6J male mice were treated with copper at 0, 100, 250, and 500 ppm in the drinking water. Chronic copper exposure altered motor function and induced dopaminergic neuronal loss, astrocytosis, and microgliosis in a dose-dependent manner. α-Synuclein accumulation and aggregation were increased in response to copper, and the proteasome and autophagy alterations, previously observed in vitro, were confirmed in vivo, where protein ubiquitination, AMPK phosphorylation, and the autophagy marker LC3-II were also increased by copper exposure. Finally, nitrosative stress was induced by copper in a concentration-dependent fashion, as evidenced by increased protein nitration. To our knowledge, this is the first study combining chronic copper exposure and aging, which may represent an in vivo model of non-genetic PD and help to assess potential prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.

Vagal control, a key component of parasympathetic autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation, may reflect a neurophysiological biomarker of internal LOC-Cognition. We used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify a shared neurophysiological marker of ANS regulation from electrocardiogram (during auditory working memory) and functional connectivity (FC) data.

Smaller hippocampal volume (HV) is a risk factor for the development of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed whether coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) are associated with HV in participants from the Dallas Heart Study, a community-based study of Dallas County, Texas, residents.
METHODS: Data from a total of n = 1821 participants in the Dallas Heart Study with brain magnetic resonance imaging, CAC, and CIMT information were included in the present study, after excluding those with a history of myocardial infarction or stroke. To evaluate the effect of CAC and CIMT on total HV, 4 linear regression analyses were conducted in which the primary predictor was (1) CAC as a continuous metric; (2) CAC as a binary metric (CAC = 0 vs. CAC ≥ 1); (3) CAC as a continuous metric but only for those with CAC >0; and (4) CIMT as a continuous metric. Demographic and cardiovascular disease risk factors, as well as intracranial volume, were entered into the model as covariates.
RESULTS: Participants were largely women (58.2%) with a mean age of 49.7 ± 10.3 years. Forty-six percent of the sample reported being Black, and approximately 14% reported being Hispanic. All 3 variations of the CAC effect were nonsignificant predictors of total HV (β = -0.013, P = 0.602; β = -0.011, P = 0.650; β = 0.036, P = 0.354, respectively), as was the effect of CIMT (β = 0.009, P = 0.686).
CONCLUSIONS: Current findings suggest nonsignificant relationships between both CAC and CIMT and between CAC and total HV, while controlling for other related factors in a large, diverse, community-based sample of people without a history of myocardial infarction or stroke. In the context of existing evidence that both coronary artery disease and smaller HV are associated with the development of dementia, the present findings suggest that neither marker of the cardiovascular disease examined here is associated with a reduction in HV in the population studied.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the causal association between TSH levels and all-cause mortality using Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.
METHODS: MR analyses using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with TSH levels (P < 5 × 10-8) as instruments. Mortality data were obtained from the UK Biobank, including 384 344 participants who were recruited from 22 assessment centers across the UK taken between 2006 and 2010. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association of the TSH genetic risk score (GRS) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS: 15 557 individuals died during a median of 9.00 years of follow-up in the UK Biobank. A total of 70 SNPs were included in the MR analysis. The main MR analyses showed that 1 SD increase in TSH was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.972, 95% CI 0.948-0.996), which may be largely attributed to respiratory disease mortality (OR 0.881, 95% CI 0.805-0.963).

However, PD-related non-motor symptoms may appear several years before diagnosis. REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and olfactory deficits (hyposmia) are risk factors, but they are not specific for predicting progression towards PD. Other PD-related markers, for example brain imaging markers, may help to identify preclinical PD in hyposmic RBD patients. Studies have reported abnormal structural characteristics in the corticospinal tract (CST) of PD patients, but it is unclear whether hyposmic RBD patients have similar abnormalities that may help to predict PD in these individuals. This study examined whether CST abnormalities may be a potential marker of PD risk by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures.
METHODS: Twenty hyposmic RBD patients, 31 PD patients, and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were studied. DTI data were collected on a 1.5 T MRI scanner and CST characteristics (FA, MD, AD, and RD) were evaluated using probabilistic tractography (with seed regions in the bilateral primary motor cortex and mediolateral cerebral peduncles). Olfactory function was assessed with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT).
RESULTS: Hyposmic RBD patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) values of the right CST compared to HCs but did not differ from PD patients. PD patients showed a trend of higher MD values compared to HCs.

Tracking the earliest stages of the progression to dementia is paramount, and yet the importance of olfactory ability throughout cognitive states and death remains unclear.
METHODS: Drawing data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (N = 1 501; 74% female), olfactory ability was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (range = 0-16), while cognitive states (unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia) were determined using a 3-step neuropsychological diagnostic protocol at up to 15 annual occasions. Multistate survival models simultaneously estimated the association of olfactory ability on transitions through cognitive states and death, while multinomial regression models estimated cognitively unimpaired and total life expectancies.
RESULTS: Higher olfactory scores were associated with a reduced risk of transitioning from unimpaired cognition to MCI (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82-0.88) and from MCI to dementia (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.86-0.93), indicating that 1-unit increase in olfactory scores was associated with an approximate 14% and 11% reduction in risk, respectively. Additionally, higher olfactory scores were associated with a greater likelihood of transitioning backward from MCI to unimpaired cognition (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12). Furthermore, higher baseline olfactory scores were associated with more years of longevity without cognitive impairment. However, olfaction was not associated with the transition to death when accounting for transitions through cognitive states.

This longitudinal study aimed to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of white matter hold independent utility for predicting future psychosis in PD, and whether they could be combined with clinical predictors to improve the prognostication of PD psychosis.
METHODS: This study included 123 newly diagnosed PD patients collected in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Tract-based spatial statistics were used to compare baseline DTI metrics between PD patients who developed psychosis and those who did not during follow-up. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the clinical and white matter markers predictive of psychosis.

Additionally, it is linked to inflammation, cytokine release, apoptosis and various degenerative conditions. Astrocytes and microglia might have a role in mediating these processes. Caffeine, a psychoactive beverage, has been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive and memory impairment. This study proposes anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic role of caffeine, which can be mediated via microglia/astrocyte activation and overexpression of pro-inflammatory molecules. T2D was induced in rats by feeding with high fat high sugar diet and injecting a single low dose streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneally. Other diabetic rats were given caffeine orally (in two doses) for 5 weeks, starting 1 week before STZ injection. Measurement of plasma cytokines, TNFα and IL6, was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. After sacrificing animals, brains were obtained and processed for histological evaluation. Immunohistochemistry was also performed using the following primary antibodies, anti-astrocyte marker GFAP, anti-microglia marker CD11b and apoptotic marker (anti-cleaved caspase-3). There was upregulation of IL6 and TNF-α in diabetic rats. Additionally, histological evaluation of the hippocampus of diabetic rats revealed cellular degeneration. There was increased immunostaining of GFAP, CD11b and cleaved caspase-3 in diabetic rats. Pretreatment with caffeine to diabetic rats, resulted in improvement of structural changes and decrease in cytokine levels and immuno-markers, expression, and this was in a dose-dependent manner.

Post-stroke disabilities like paralysis, dementia, etc., can affect the quality of life of patients as well as their families. A combined increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes during inflammation in stroke manifests as an elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), thereby indicating the severity of neural damage. Aim We aimed to determine if an elevated NLR observed on the day of hospital admission can predict a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in stroke patients. Confirmatory results could aid in developing risk stratification for management, ultimately improving clinical and functional outcomes. Materials and methods Sixty stroke patients were monitored throughout their hospital stay in this prospective cohort study. NLR was calculated at admission using routine complete blood counts. The data were analyzed using SPSS Software v23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). An unpaired t-test was used to compare the means between the two groups. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test. The receiver operating curve (ROC) was plotted and used to ascertain if a cut-off value of NLR could be obtained to predict in-hospital mortality in stroke patients. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results About 23.3% (n=14) of the patients died during their hospital stay, with no significant differences between the survivor and death cohorts in terms of comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. The mean NLR calculated within 24 hours of hospital admission in patients who died (NLR=8.47 (standard deviation (SD)=4.67)) was significantly higher (p=0.009) than in those who survived (NLR=5.84 (SD=2.62)). Upon ROC analysis, patients with NLR >6.03 on the day of admission demonstrated a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (p=0.015 (95% CI: 0.577-0.855)). An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 with a sensitivity of 92.86% and a specificity of 54.35% was obtained. Conclusions Elevated NLR (cut-off >6.03) obtained within 24 hours of hospital admission is an indicator of a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in stroke patients. Hence, patients presenting with a high NLR at admission can be prioritized for personalized targeted treatment, potentially reducing mortality and post-stroke complications.","2022",,"Cureus"," Aim We aimed to determine if an elevated NLR observed on the day of hospital admission can predict a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in stroke patients ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"36480378","A review of novel Cognitive Challenge Tests for the assessment of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.","Curiel Cid RE","OBJECTIVES: There is currently a lack of consensus among neuropsychologists about which cognitive assessment paradigms hold the most promise in identifying subtle cognitive deficits in preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and which are most useful for monitoring risk of cognitive deterioration. Many widely used instruments are older versions of tests originally developed for the assessment of dementia or traumatic brain injury. Current efforts to digitize these measures provides more uniform and remote assessment, which is an advancement, but does not reflect significant changes in paradigmatic underpinnings or recent advances in cognitive neuroscience.
METHOD: This work provides an overview of novel Cognitive Challenge Tests (CCTs) that employ semantic interference paradigms that uniquely measure the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI). Other salient methods to measure meaningful cognitive change in early stage AD are also presented, as well as how they compare with traditional neuropsychological assessments. Finally, future directions for the development of more effective assessment paradigms are discussed.
RESULTS: frPSI is a cognitive marker which measures the persistent inability to learn new semantically competing stimuli despite multiple opportunities to do so. frPSI and deficits in semantic inhibitory control have repeatedly shown utility for the early detection of AD during its preclinical stages. These novel cognitive markers have been related to various biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration among culturally diverse older adults.
CONCLUSIONS: To meet the critical needs of a rapidly evolving field, cognitive assessment instruments must show sufficient scientific rigor including robust sensitivity, specificity, and predictive utility among culturally and linguistically diverse populations and importantly, be correlated to AD biomarkers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This nested case control study analyzed perioperative plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients (n = 40) who developed POD undergone DBS surgery (n = 10) and those who did not (n = 30). Blood sample was collected before surgery and on the first day postoperative, CSF sample was collected at the beginning of the operation. POD was assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) twice a day between 7:00 am and 7:00 pm after the surgery until discharge. Plasma and CSF sample from the two groups were analyzed to investigate possible biomarkers for POD in PD patients.
RESULTS: There was no difference between POD and Non-POD groups on the concentration of Interleukin 6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α in CSF, preoperative plasma and postoperative plasma. There was no difference between POD and Non-POD groups on the concentration of S100 calcium-binding protein β protein (S100β) and Neurofilament light chain (NFL) in preoperative plasma and postoperative plasma. The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), NFL and S100β were significant higher in POD group than non-POD group in CSF. The concentration of CRP was significantly higher in POD group than non-POD group in preoperative plasma and postoperative plasma. CSF concentration of S100β might be a potential biomarker for POD via the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and the area under the curve value of 0.973.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of exposure to air pollution with the risk of dementia and cognitive decline in the population-based Rotterdam Study.
METHODS: Between 2009 and 2010, we determined air pollutant concentrations at participants residential addresses using land use regression models. Determined air pollutants include particulate matter <10μm (PM10) and <2.5μm (PM2.5), a proxy of elemental carbon (PM2.5 absorbance), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). As the individual air pollutant levels were highly correlated (r = 0.71-0.98), we computed a general marker covering all air pollutants based on a principal component analysis. We followed participants up for dementia until 2018 and determined cognitive performance during two subsequent examination rounds. Using Cox and linear mixed models, we related air pollution to dementia and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Of the 7,511 non-demented participants at baseline, 545 developed dementia during a median follow-up of 7 years. The general marker of all air pollutants was not associated with the risk of dementia (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.04 [0.95-1.15]), neither were the individual air pollutants.

,"36450605","Association of Subjective Cognitive Decline With Progression to Dementia in a Cognitively Unimpaired Multiracial Community Sample.","Chapman S","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This prospective study seeks to examine the utility of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) as a marker of future progression to dementia in a community-based cohort of non-Latinx White, non-Latinx Black, and Latinx individuals. Debate surrounds the utility of SCD, the subjective perception of decline in one's cognition before such impairment is evident in traditional neuropsychological assessments, as an early indicator of impending Alzheimer disease. Unfortunately, most studies examining SCD have been conducted in non-Latinx White samples and commonly exclude groups of individuals shown to be most vulnerable to dementia.
METHODS: Participants were enrolled into this cohort study from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project if they were cognitively unimpaired, had baseline measurement of SCD, and self-identified as non-Latinx White, non-Latinx Black, or Latinx. SCD was measured as a continuous sum of 10 items assessing cognitive complaints. Competing risk models tested the main effects of baseline SCD on progression to dementia. Models were adjusted for age, sex/gender, years of education, medical comorbidity burden, enrollment cohort, and baseline memory test performance with death jointly modelled as a function of race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: A total of 4,043 (1,063 non-Latinx White, 1,267 non-Latinx Black, and 1,713 Latinx) participants were selected for this study with a mean age of 75 years, 67% women, and with a mean follow-up of 5 years. Higher baseline SCD was associated with increased rates of incident dementia over time in the full sample (hazard ratio [HR] 1.085, CI 1.047-1.125, 
DISCUSSION: Overall results of this study support SCD as a prodromal marker of dementia in a multiracial community sample, and in Latinx and non-Latinx Black individuals in particular. Because models examining the risk of dementia were adjusted for baseline memory test performance, the results support the idea that SCD, a subjective reflection of one's own current cognitive functioning, contributes information above and beyond standard memory testing. Current findings highlight the importance of carefully evaluating any memory concerns raised by older adults during routine visits and underscore the potential utility of screening older adults for SCD.","2023",,"Neurology","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : This prospective study seeks to examine the utility of subjective cognitive decline ( SCD ) as a marker of future progression to dementia in a community-based cohort of non-Latinx White , non-Latinx Black , and Latinx individuals ","other","Humans, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

OBJECTIVES: To describe the development of pracoff dyskinesia across our study population and consider its utility as an indicator that trophic factor-induced terminal sprouting can affect enhanced endogenous dopamine levels.
METHODS: This was a blinded retrospective analysis of videotaped motor assessments at eight weekly study visits. Dyskinesia in the pracoff and supramaximal on state were rated using the Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale. Logistic regression was employed to explore the predictors of pracoff dyskinesia. Generalized estimated equations were used to estimate the cumulative effect of repeated GDNF infusions.
RESULTS: Mild-moderate choreiform dyskinesia in the pracoff state were seen in 47 assessments in 17 (n = 41) subjects. During the 18-month timeframe, each subsequent 8-week period of receiving GDNF increased the risk of demonstrating pracoff state dyskinesia by 34% (odds ratio [OR], 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20, 1.50); P < 0.001). An increasing supramaximal on dyskinesia score (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.07, 1.30]; P = 0.001) also increased the likelihood of pracoff dyskinesia at that visit.

Delirium (acute confusion) is a common complication of acute illness and is associated with increased risk of dementia and mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying delirium, particularly in relation to the KP, remain elusive.METHODSWe undertook a multicenter observational study with 586 hospitalized patients (248 with delirium) and investigated associations between delirium and KP metabolites measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum by targeted metabolomics. We also explored associations between KP metabolites and markers of neuronal damage and 1-year mortality.RESULTSIn delirium, we found concentrations of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid in CSF (CSF-QA) (OR 2.26 [1.78, 2.87], P < 0.001) to be increased and also found increases in several other KP metabolites in serum and CSF. In addition, CSF-QA was associated with the neuronal damage marker neurofilament light chain (NfL) (β 0.43, P < 0.001) and was a strong predictor of 1-year mortality (HR 4.35 [2.93, 6.45] for CSF-QA ≥ 100 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The associations between CSF-QA and delirium, neuronal damage, and mortality remained highly significant following adjustment for confounders and multiple comparisons.CONCLUSIONOur data identified how systemic inflammation, neurotoxicity, and delirium are strongly linked via the KP and should inform future delirium prevention and treatment clinical trials that target enzymes of the KP.FUNDINGNorwegian Health Association and South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authorities.","2023",,"J Clin Invest",,"observational study","Humans, FALSE, Quinolinic Acid, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Acute Disease, FALSE, Hip Fractures, TRUE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Kynurenine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Delirium, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, Inflammation, FALSE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The main outcome measures were to evaluation of medicines utilisation, including the number of medicines, medicine regimen complexity, potential under-prescribing and high-risk prescribing (prescribing cascades, anticholinergic or sedative medicines or other potentially inappropriate medicines) with data analysed descriptively.
RESULTS: Medicines regimens were analysed for 303 residents (76% female) with a mean age of 85.0 ± 7.5 years, of whom the majority were living with dementia (72%). Residents were prescribed an average of 10.3 ± 4.5 regular medicines daily. Most participants (85%) had highly complex regimens. Most residents (92%) were exposed to polypharmacy (five or more medicines). Nearly all, 302 (98%) residents had at least one marker of potentially suboptimal prescribing.

However, although dopamine transporter single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been used to demonstrate the presence of nigro-striatal deficit in iRBD, quantifiable correlates of this are currently lacking. Sensitivity to rewarding stimuli is reduced in some people with Parkinson's disease, potentially contributing to aspects of the neuropsychiatric phenotype in these individuals. Furthermore, a role for dopaminergic degeneration is suggested by the fact that reward insensitivity can be improved by dopaminergic medications. Patients with iRBD present a unique opportunity to study the relationship between reward sensitivity and early dopaminergic deficit in the unmedicated state. Here, we investigate whether a non-invasive, objective measure of reward sensitivity might be a marker of dopaminergic status in prodromal Parkinson's disease by comparing with SPECT/CT measurement of dopaminergic loss in the basal ganglia. Striatal dopaminergic deficits in iRBD are associated with progression to Parkinsonian disorders. Therefore, identification of a clinically measurable correlate of this degenerative process might provide a basis for the development of novel risk stratification tools. Using a recently developed incentivized eye-tracking task, we quantified reward sensitivity in a cohort of 41 patients with iRBD and compared this with data from 40 patients with Parkinson's disease and 41 healthy controls. Patients with iRBD also underwent neuroimaging with dopamine transporter SPECT/CT. Overall, reward sensitivity, indexed by pupillary response to monetary incentives, was reduced in iRBD cases compared with controls and was not significantly different to that in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, in iRBD patients with normal dopamine transporter SPECT/CT imaging, reward sensitivity was not significantly different from healthy controls. Across all iRBD cases, a positive association was observed between reward sensitivity and dopaminergic SPECT/CT signal in the putamen. These findings demonstrate a direct relationship between dopaminergic deficit and reward sensitivity in patients with iRBD and suggest that measurement of pupillary responses could be of value in models of risk stratification and disease progression in these individuals.","2023",,"Brain"," Here , we investigate whether a non-invasive , objective measure of reward sensitivity might be a marker of dopaminergic status in prodromal Parkinson's disease by comparing with SPECT / CT measurement of dopaminergic loss in the basal ganglia ","other","Humans, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins, FALSE, Dopamine, FALSE, Reward, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in primary motor cortex was assessed with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in 23 healthy adults with normal (n = 14; 61 ± 7 yrs) or abnormally enlarged (hyperechogenic; n = 9; 60 ± 6 yrs) area of SN echogenicity. Thirteen of these participants (7 SN- and 6 SN+) also underwent brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate pre-SMA neurochemistry.

There was a significant positive relationship, however, between area of echogenicity in the right SN and the magnitude of intracortical facilitation in the right (ipsilateral) primary motor cortex (p = .005; multivariate regression), evidenced by the amplitude of the conditioned motor evoked potential (MEP) at the 10-12 ms interstimulus interval. This relationship was not present on the left side. Pre-SMA glutamate did not predict primary motor cortex inhibition or facilitation.

METHODS: 195 community-dwelling older people with hypertension were invited to undergo MRI twice, with a three-year interval. Cognition was evaluated every two years for 6-8 years using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). We assessed relations of sCoV, CBF and WMHV with cognitive decline during follow-up. We also registered dementia diagnoses, up to 9 years after the first scan. In an additional analysis, we compared these MRI parameters between participants that did and did not develop dementia.
RESULTS: 136/195 completed the second scan. sCoV and CBF were not associated with MMSE changes during 6-8 years of follow-up. Higher WMHV was associated with declining MMSE scores (-0.02 points/year/ml, 95%CI=-0.03 to -0.00). ScOv and CBF did not differ between participants who did (n=15) and did not (n=180) develop dementia, whereas higher WMHV was reported in participants who developed dementia after the first MRI (13.3 vs 6.1mL, p<0.001). There were no associations between longitudinal change in any of the MRI parameters and cognitive decline or subsequent dementia.
CONCLUSION: Global sCoV and CBF were less sensitive longitudinal markers of cognitive decline and dementia compared to WMHV in community-dwelling older people with hypertension. Larger longitudinal MRI perfusion studies are needed to identify possible (regional) patterns of cerebral perfusion preceding cognitive decline and dementia diagnosis.","2022",,"Cereb Circ Cogn Behav",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"36324405","Heart rate variability and cognitive performance in adults with cardiovascular risk.","Imbimbo C","BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, has been associated with both cardiovascular disease and cognitive dysfunction. In turn, cardiovascular risk has been linked to an increased risk of dementia onset. However, whether autonomic dysfunction may represent an early marker of cognitive decline in individuals with high cardiovascular risk is still an open issue.
METHODS: We performed a complete 24-hour HRV analysis in 50 middle-aged and elderly subjects with cardiovascular risk as assessed with the European Society of Cardiology Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (ESC SCORE). Cognitive performance was evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and Stroop Color and Word Test. Stepwise regression was used to identify significant associations between 24-hour ambulatory ECGs parameters and cognitive performances.
RESULTS: There were 30 women and 20 men with mean age of 64.9 years (range 51-77) and the mean ESC SCORE was 6%. Four subjects were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Associations were found between measures of HRV and measures of cognition. Ultra-low frequency (ULF) band power of HRV significantly correlated with MoCA (r = 0.424, p = 0.003), also after adjustment for demographics and education. A significant association was also found between the ESC SCORE and ULF band power (r = -0.470, p = 0.0009).
CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-low frequency band power of HRV is associated with cognitive performance of middle-aged and elderly subjects with cardiovascular risk.

,"36323521","Plasma Phosphorylated Tau at Threonine 181 and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer Disease.","Ghahremani M","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), a well-validated marker of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic change, could be a more efficient way to diagnose AD than invasive or expensive biomarkers requiring CSF or PET. In some individuals, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are the earliest manifestation of AD, observed in advance of clear cognitive decline. However, the few studies assessing AD biomarkers in association with NPS have often had imprecision in capturing behavioral symptoms that represent sequelae of neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the mild behavioral impairment (MBI) construct was developed, framing NPS in a way to improve the precision of risk estimates for disease. MBI core criteria stipulate that NPS emerge de novo in later life and persist for at least 6 months. Here, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, we investigated associations of MBI with p-tau181, neuropsychological test performance, and incident AD.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants were selected. MBI status was derived from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) using a published algorithm. NPI total scores at baseline and year 1 visits were used to operationalize MBI (score >0 at both visits), NPS not meeting the MBI criteria (NPS-not-MBI, score >0 at only 1 visit), and no NPS (score = 0 at both visits). Linear regressions were fitted for cross-sectional analyses; multilevel linear mixed-effects and Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to examine the longitudinal associations of MBI with changes in p-tau181 and cognition and incident dementia.
RESULTS: The sample included 571 participants (age 72.2 years, 46.8% female, 64.8% MCI). Cross-sectionally (β = 8.1%, 95% CI 1.4%-15.2%, 
DISCUSSION: These findings extend the evidence base that MBI is associated with elevated risk of cognitive decline and dementia and a sequela of emerging Alzheimer-related proteinopathies. MBI offers a substantial improvement over current approaches that explore behavior as a proxy marker for Alzheimer-related proteinopathies, with both clinical and AD trial enrichment implications.","2023",,"Neurology","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 ( p-tau181 ) , a well-validated marker of Alzheimer disease ( AD ) pathologic change , could be a more efficient way to diagnose AD than invasive or expensive biomarkers requiring CSF or PET ","other","Humans, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Neurodegenerative Diseases, TRUE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, tau Proteins, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of HGS and the association of HGS with cognitive impairment in a multiethnic cohort from Singapore.
METHODS: This study (n = 2,109, median [Q1, Q3] age: 53 [48, 60] years, 59.6% women) was based on cross-sectional data from Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort. HGS was collected using hand-held Electronic Dynamometer. The potential determinants of HGS included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, physical activity, serum cholesterol and history of hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. Cognition, assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), was analyzed as both continuous and binary outcome (cognitively impaired [scores < 26] and cognitively normal [scores≥26]).
RESULTS: In total, 239 (11.3%) participants were cognitively impaired. Older age, female sex, Malay or Indian compared with Chinese ethnicity, and diabetes history were associated with decreased HGS, whereas higher education, higher body mass index, and more physical activity were associated with higher HGS. Higher HGS was associated with higher MMSE scores (β: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.49) and 37% lower odds of cognitive impairment (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.49-0.82).

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there is an association between 3 common single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the LAG3 gene and its closely related CD4 molecule gene and the risk of PD in a Caucasian Spanish population.

The implementation of scalable, sustainable, and patient-driven processes may improve early detection of ADRD; however, there are competing approaches; information may be obtained either directly from a patient (e.g., through a questionnaire) or passively using electronic health record (EHR) data. In this study, we aim to identify the benefit of a combined approach using a pragmatic cluster-randomized clinical trial.
METHODS: We have developed a Passive Digital Marker (PDM), based on machine learning algorithms applied to EHR data, and paired it with a patient-reported outcome (the Quick Dementia Rating Scale or QDRS) to rapidly share an identified risk of impairment to a patient's physician. Clinics in both south Florida and Indiana will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms: 1200 patients in each of the two populations will be administered either the PDM, the PDM with the QDRS, or neither, for a total of 7200 patients across all clinics and populations. Both incidence of ADRD diagnosis and acceptance into ADRD diagnostic work-up regimens is hypothesized to increase when patients are administered both the PDM and QDRS. Physicians performing the work-up regimens will be blind to the study arm of the patient.
DISCUSSION: This study aims to test the accuracy and effectiveness of the two scalable approaches (PDM and QDRS) for the early detection of ADRD among older adults attending primary care practices. The data obtained in this study may lead to national early detection and management program for ADRD as an efficient and beneficial method of reducing the current and future burden of ADRD, as well as improving the annual rate of newly documented ADRD in primary care practices.

The hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) protein in neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells. Over the past decades, the diagnosis and treatment of PD had a view centred on motoric endpoint and deficits in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and consequently animal models of PD with predominantly motor behavior deficits have been used to study the disease. However, clinical trials have failed to translate results from animal models into successful treatments. PD as a multisystem disorder therefore requires additional assessment of early non-motor symptoms. Braak's staging revealed early α-Syn pathology in the pontine brainstem and olfactory circuits controlling rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and olfaction, respectively.

This study aimed to determine the association between MRI-visible PVS burden and the risk of incident dementia.
METHODS: This study included community-dwelling Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants with available brain MRI-PVS ratings, free of stroke and dementia. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of the association between MRI-visible PVS and incident dementia. PVS were rated using validated methods in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). The outcomes included all-cause dementia, Alzheimer dementia (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD).
RESULTS: One thousand four hundred forty-nine participants 50 years or older (46% male) were included. Over a median follow-up period of 8.3 years, the incidence of all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD was 15.8%, 12.5%, and 2.5%, respectively. In models that adjusted for vascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease, the hazard for dementia increased steadily as PVS burden increased, rising 2-fold for those with grade II PVS (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.51-3.93) to 5-fold in participants with grade IV (HR 5.05, 95% CI 2.75-9.26) compared with grade I PVS in CSO. In the BG, hazards increased 1.6-fold (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15-2.27) for grade II to 2.6-fold (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.04-6.88) for grade IV compared with grade I PVS. The association remained significant for CSO but not for BG, after adjustment for white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), covert infarcts, and total brain volume. Similar findings were observed for AD, but VaD, limited by a small number of events, was not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION: Higher burden of PVS in CSO was associated with increased risk of developing dementia, independent of vascular risk factors, total brain volume, WMHVs, and covert infarcts.

Visual deficits potentially increase dementia risk in a vulnerable individual by reducing resilience to dementia. Hearing deficits may indicate a susceptibility to Alzheimer disease through a variety of mechanisms. More generally, sensory impairment could be related to factors associated with resilience against dementia.

We sought to determine the extent to which disparities in dementia would be reduced had different racial groups received the same quality of education, with no change to present disparities in educational attainment.
METHODS: We conducted a literature review to assess whether and how measures of educational attainment and quality are utilized in the development of norms for standard cognitive screening measures. In a separate search of the literature, we identified estimates of relationships between race, education quality and dementia; and calculated the adjusted association between race and dementia had education quality been equalized between Black and White participants.
RESULTS: Most norms for cognitive measures included educational attainment, but few addressed quality. Our search identified relevant parameter estimates: 44.3% of Black participants and 10.5% of White participants had ""limited literacy"" (<9th grade reading level, a potential marker of poor education quality), which was associated with a 53% greater hazard of dementia compared with ""adequate literacy"" (≥ 9th grade reading level) after adjusting for educational attainment. Applying these parameters to a hazard ratio of 1.37 (95%CI: 1.12,1.67) for the risk of dementia comparing Black to White participants, we obtained an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (0.96,1.43), a 54% reduction.

Few studies have, however, considered beat-to-beat BPV. This study, therefore, evaluated the relationship between beat-to-beat BPV and cognitive function among community-dwellers aged 55 years and over.
METHODS: Data was obtained from the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) study, which employed random stratified sampling from three parliamentary constituencies within the Klang Valley. Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) was recorded using non-invasive BP monitoring (TaskforceTM, CNSystems). Low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and low-to-high frequency (LF:HF) ratio for BPV were derived using fast Fourier transformation. Cognition was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, and categorized into normal aging, mild impairment and moderate-to-severe impairment.
RESULTS: Data from 1,140 individuals, mean age (SD) 68.48 (7.23) years, were included. Individuals with moderate-to-severe impairment had higher HF-BPV for systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure compared to individuals within the normal aging group [OR (95% CI) = 2.29 (1.62-3.24)] and [OR (95% CI) = 1.80 (1.32-2.45)], while HF-SBPV [OR (95% CI) = 1.41 (1.03-1.93)] but not HF-DBPV was significantly higher with mild impairment compared to normal aging after adjustments for potential confounders. Moderate-to-severe impairment was associated with significantly lower LF:HF-SBPV [OR (95% CI) = 0.29 (0.18-0.47)] and LF:HF-DBPV [OR (95% CI) = 0.49 (0.34-0.72)], while mild impairment was associated with significantly lower LF:HF-SBPV [OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.34-0.80)] but not LF:HF-DBPV [OR (95% CI) = 0.81 (0.57-1.17)], compared to normal aging with similar adjustments.
CONCLUSION: Higher HF-BPV, which indicates parasympathetic activation, and lower LF:HF-BPV, which addresses sympathovagal balance, were observed among individuals with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment.

However, no studies to date have evaluated whether BP variability is related to diminished cerebrovascular reactivity, which may represent an early marker of cerebrovascular dysfunction presaging vascular brain injury.
METHODS: The present study investigated BP variability and cerebrovascular reactivity in a sample of 41 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 69.6 [SD 8.7] years) without a history of dementia or stroke. Short-term BP variability was determined from BP measurements collected continuously during a 5-minute resting period followed by cerebrovascular reactivity during 5-minute hypocapnia and hypercapnia challenge induced by visually guided breathing conditions. Cerebrovascular reactivity was quantified as percent change in cerebral perfusion by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL)-MRI per unit change in end-tidal CO2.
RESULTS: Elevated systolic BP variability was related to lower whole brain cerebrovascular reactivity during hypocapnia (ß = -0.43 [95% CI -0.73, -0.12]; P = 0.008; adjusted R2 =.11) and hypercapnia (ß = -0.42 [95% CI -0.77, -0.06]; P = 0.02; adjusted R2 = 0.19).

The aims of our study were therefore to explore MBI in MNDs both at onset and over the disease course, and to evaluate its relationship with baseline and longitudinal cognitive features.
METHODS: Sixty MND patients with cognitive/behavioral, mood, and motor examinations were recruited and followed longitudinally for up to 15 months. Associations between baseline MBI symptoms and clinical features were tested using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Based on longitudinal data, relative deltas of variation for each cognitive measure were generated, and linear regression models were then used to evaluate the role of baseline MBI symptoms in predicting longitudinal rates of cognitive decline.
RESULTS: At disease onset, the most impaired MBI domain was affective/emotional dysregulation, followed by impulse dyscontrol, apathy, and social inappropriateness. Greater MBI symptoms correlated with more severe baseline motor, cognitive/behavioral, and mood disturbances (p values from <0.001 to 0.05). Longitudinally, the greatest decline was observed in the affective/emotional dysregulation domain, followed by impulse dyscontrol, apathy, and social inappropriateness. Greater MBI symptoms at onset were significant predictors of more severe longitudinal cognitive decline in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-specific and ALS-nonspecific functions (p values from <0.001 to 0.03).

However, little is known regarding brain changes underlying cognitive dispersion, and the association of cognitive dispersion with in vivo AD biomarkers and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) has received limited study. We therefore examined associations among cognitive dispersion, amyloid-beta (Aβ) positivity, and regional CBF among older adults free of dementia.
METHOD: One hundred and forty-eight Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired to quantify CBF. Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) imaging determined Aβ positivity.
RESULTS: Adjusting for age, gender, education, and mean cognitive performance, older adults who were Aβ+ showed higher cognitive dispersion relative to those who were Aβ-. Across the entire sample, higher cognitive dispersion was associated with reduced CBF in inferior parietal and temporal regions. Secondary analyses stratified by Aβ status demonstrated that higher cognitive dispersion was associated with reduced CBF among Aβ+ individuals but not among those who were Aβ-.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive dispersion may be sensitive to early Aβ accumulation and cerebrovascular changes adjusting for demographics and mean neuropsychological performance. Associations between cognitive dispersion and CBF were observed among Aβ+ individuals, suggesting that cognitive dispersion may be a marker of brain changes among individuals on the AD continuum.

METHODS: Circulating GFAP levels were assayed using a Simoa HD-1 analyzer in 4338 adults without prevalent dementia from four longitudinal community-based cohort studies. The associations between GFAP levels with general cognition, total brain volume, and hippocampal volume were evaluated with separate linear regression models in each cohort with adjustment for age, sex, education, race, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, body mass index, apolipoprotein E ε4 status, site, and time between GFAP blood draw and the outcome. Associations with incident all-cause and Alzheimer's disease dementia were evaluated with adjusted Cox proportional hazard models.

However, the clinical translation of these abnormalities in attention processes is not well-defined, and commonly used neuropsychological tests are not able to detect significant deficits in Parkinson's disease patients with isolated minor hallucinations.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of minor hallucinations in Parkinson's disease during an attentional task assessing response inhibition and interference control.
METHODS: Fifty-five non-demented Parkinson's disease patients with (PD-mH; n = 27) and without minor hallucinations (PD-NH; n = 28) were included in the analysis. An Ericksen flanker task was performed to compare the effect of presenting congruent and incongruent stimuli on accuracy, reaction times and stimulus-locked event-related potentials morphology.
RESULTS: Although both groups showed equivalent performance in a standard neuropsychological assessment, in the flanker task accuracy rates were lower in the PD-mH group in incongruent trials (p = 0.005). In the event-related potentials, PD-mH patients showed increased amplitude of the N2 at Fz [t(53); p < 0.05] and decreased amplitude of the P300 at Pz [t(53); p < 0.05] for the incongruent trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease patients with isolated minor hallucinations were more susceptible to interference mediated by irrelevant stimuli and had less cognitive control for suppressing these interferences.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the decreased emotion regulation in individuals with MCI combined with depressive symptoms are not precise. We assessed the behavioral performance by emotion regulation tasks and recorded event-related electroencephalography (EEG) signals related to emotion regulation tasks simultaneously. EEG analysis, including event-related potential (ERP), event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), functional connectivity and graph theory, was used to compare the difference between MCI individuals and MCI depressed individuals in behavioral performance, the late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes, neural oscillations and brain networks during the processing of emotional stimuli. We found that MCI depressed individuals have negative preferences and are prone to allocate more attentional resources to negative stimuli. Results suggested that theta and alpha oscillations activity is increased, and gamma oscillations activity is decreased during negative stimulus processing in MCI depressed individuals, thus indicating that the decreased emotion regulation in MCI depressed individuals may be associated with enhanced low-frequency and decreased high-frequency oscillations activity. Functional connectivity analysis revealed a decrease in functional connectivity in the left cerebral hemisphere of the alpha band and an increase in functional connectivity in the right cerebral hemisphere of the alpha band in MCI depressed individuals. Graph theory analysis suggested that global network metrics, including clustering coefficients and disassortative, decreased, while nodal and modular network metrics regarding local nodal efficiency, degree centrality, and betweenness centrality were significantly increased in the frontal lobe and decreased in the parieto-occipital lobe, which was observed in the alpha band, further suggesting that abnormal alpha band network connectivity may be a potential marker of depressive symptoms. Correlational analyses showed that depressive symptoms were closely related to emotion regulation, power oscillations and functional connectivity. In conclusion, the dominant processing of negative stimuli, the increased low-frequency oscillations activity and decreased high-frequency activity, so as the decrease in top-down information processing in the frontal parieto-occipital lobe, results in the abnormality of alpha-band network connectivity. It is suggested that these factors, in turn, contribute to the declined ability of MCI depressed individuals in emotion regulation.","2022",,"Front Aging Neurosci",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Additionally, male sex is a risk marker for developing PD, but sexual dimorphism of neural and glial populations in the AON has rarely been considered. The aim of this study was to analyze the density of NeuN, Iba-1, GFAP, and Lewy bodies (LBs), as well as the relationship of these cell type markers with pathology along the rostrocaudal axis of the AON (bulbar, retrobulbar, cortical anterior, and posterior divisions). Cavalieri, optical fractionator, and area fraction fractionator stereological approaches were used for the volume, cell populations and LBs densities, area fraction, and percentage of overlap. Iba-1 and α-syn intensities were measured using ImageJ. In non-PD (NPD) cases, the volume was lower in the AON at the extremes of the rostrocaudal axis than in the intermediate divisions. Cortical anterior AON volume decreased in PD compared with NPD cases. NeuN density decreased rostrocaudally in AON portions in NPD and PD cases. This occurred similarly in Iba-1 but only in PD samples. Iba-1 intensity significantly increased in bulbar AON between PD and NPD. No changes were found in astrocytes. Eight percent of NeuN, 0.1% of Iba-1, and 0.1% of GFAP areas overlapped with LBs area along the AON portions.

This study aimed to operationalize neuropsychological decline, termed ""neuropsychological (NP) decline,"" in older adults followed over 12 months in order to aid in the stratification of dementia risk along the cognitively unimpaired-to-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) spectrum.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study utilized 6,794 older adults from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database with a baseline diagnosis of normal cognition, impaired without MCI or with MCI. Operationalization of NP decline over 12-month follow-up used regression-based norms developed in a robustly normal reference sample. The extent to which each participant's 12-month follow-up score deviated from norm-referenced expectations was quantified and standardized to an NP decline z-score.

As many nations show a rise in the number of citizens aged over 60 years, the study of the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive functional reductions, such as inflammation, is important. Inflammaging has been implicated in progressive minor decline through to dementia typologies, with peripheral cytokine patterns investigated for their potential role in cognitive function. Assessing the relationship between these markers and cognitive performance could elucidate mechanisms with aging beyond neuropathologies. The research literature suggests peripheral cytokines/chemokines such as interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein are associated with cognitive processing. In this systematic review, we examine the evidence for a relationship between a range of peripheral inflammatory markers and domains of cognitive function in healthy older adults. To do this, a literature search was conducted using the following databases: SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Twenty-nine studies met our inclusion criteria. Although a wide range of systemic inflammatory biomarkers were examined, IL-6 and CRP were the most studied. The evidence suggests an inverse inflammatory biomarker-cognitive function relationship whereby elevations in most cytokines were associated with poorer performance across cognitive domains.

After discussing current classification concepts of the synucleinopathies, this invited mini-review reflects on two recently described and validated spinal fluid biomarkers, namely neurofilament light chain (NfL) and α-synuclein oligomers detected by protein aggregation assays, that have shown great promise not only as markers differentiating MSA from the Lewy-body synucleinopathies but also as markers that predict future phenoconversion to MSA among patients with PAF. Discussed are the strengths and limitations of these markers, and how they appear to complement each other nicely as a biomarker panel, enhancing the specificity of one of these markers, yet adding further robustness and simplicity to a marker that is technically rather challenging.

OBJECTIVE: We examined associations between PVS count, vascular and neurodegenerative risk factors, and cognitive status among the predominantly Hispanic participants of the FL-VIP Study of Alzheimer's Disease Risk.
METHODS: Using brain MRI (n = 228), we counted PVS in single axial image through the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). PVS per region were scored as 0 (none), 1 (&lt;10), 2 (11-20), 3 (21-40), and 4 (&gt;40). Generalized linear models examined PVS associations with vascular risk factors and a composite vascular comorbidity risk (VASCom) score.
RESULTS: Our sample (mean age 72±8 years, 61% women, 60% Hispanic, mean education 15±4 years, 33% APOE4 carriers) was 59% hypertensive, 21% diabetic, 66% hypercholesteremic, and 30% obese. Mean VASCom score was 2.3±1.6. PVS scores ranged from 0-4 in the BG (mean 1.3±0.7) and CSO (mean 1.2±0.9), and 0-7 combined (mean 2.5±1.4).

Recently, the spatial coefficient of variation (sCoV) of ASL has been proposed as a proxy marker of cerebrovascular insufficiency. We investigated the association between baseline ASL parameters with cognitive decline, incident cerebrovascular disease, and risk of vascular events and mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: About 368 memory-clinic patients underwent three-annual neuropsychological assessments and brain MRI scans at baseline and follow-up. MRIs were graded for white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), cortical infarcts, and intracranial stenosis. Baseline gray (GM) and white matter (WM) CBF and GM-sCoV were obtained with ExploreASL from 2D-EPI pseudo-continuous ASL images. Cognitive assessment was done using a validated neuropsychological battery. Data on incident vascular events (heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack) and mortality were obtained.
RESULTS: Higher baseline GM-sCoV was associated with decline in the memory domain over 3 years of follow-up. Furthermore, higher GM-sCoV was associated with a decline in the memory domain only in participants without dementia. Higher baseline GM-sCoV was associated with progression of WMH and incident CMBs. During a mean follow-up of 3 years, 29 (7.8%) participants developed vascular events and 18 (4.8%) died. Participants with higher baseline mean GM-sCoV were at increased risk of vascular events.

RESULTS: The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of dementia for a 5-μg/m3 increase in NO2 was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.14); the adjusted HR of dementia for a 1-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was 1.10 (1.04-1.17).

Common mode of action by microglia cells is neuroinflammation and phagocytosis. Moreover, it has been discovered that inflammatory marker levels are increased in AD patients. Recent studies advocate that neuroinflammation plays a major role in AD progression. Microglia have different activation profiles depending on the region of brain and stimuli. In different activation, profile microglia can generate either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses.

Along with increasing age, type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of central nervous system disorders and cognitive impairment due to the loss of synaptic function. Central damage triggers an astroglial response, increasing the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which can be found peripherally when the blood-brain barrier is compromised.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the value of GFAP as a peripheral biomarker of central dysfunction.
METHODS: Serum levels of GFAP were compared between cases of NCD (n = 69) and age-matched controls (n = 69), analyzing the influence of diabetes as contributing factor.
RESULTS: We found higher levels of serum GFAP in subjects with NCD compared with the control group (p <0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the GFAP levels showed 65.22% sensitivity and 71.01% specificity (AUC = 0.7608), indicating good performance in the classification of controls and NCD patients. Logistic regression indicated a positive predictive power of 67.50% considering T2D status; adding GFAP levels, the predictive power rises to 71.93%.

METHODS: Olfaction was tested using the Japanese version of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-J) in 155 consecutive patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD and 34 healthy controls. IRBD patients were followed up for 5.8 ± 3.2 (range 0.2-11) years. Thirty-eight patients underwent repeat UPSIT-J evaluation at 2.7 ± 1.3 years after the baseline test.
RESULTS: UPSIT-J score was lower in IRBD patients than in age- and sex-matched controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cutoff score of 22.5 in UPSIT-J discriminated between IRBD patients and controls with a sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 81.8%. Anosmia (UPSIT-J score < 19) was present in 54.2% of IRBD patients. In total, 42 patients developed a neurodegenerative disease, of whom 17 had PD, 22 DLB, and 3 MSA. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the short-term risk of Lewy body disease (LBD) was higher in patients with anosmia than in those without anosmia. At baseline, the UPSIT-J score was similar between patients who developed PD and DLB (p = 0.136). All three IRBD patients (100%) who developed MSA did not have anosmia.
CONCLUSIONS: In IRBD patients, anosmia predicts a higher short-term risk of transition to LBD but cannot distinguish between PD and DLB. At baseline, preserved odor identification may occur in latent MSA. Future IRBD neuroprotective trials should evaluate anosmia as a marker of prodromal LBD.","2022",,"Ann Clin Transl Neurol",,"other","Anosmia, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lewy Body Disease, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Neurodegenerative Diseases, TRUE, Odorants, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Retrospective Studies, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

It remains unknown how these factors relate to one another and how they jointly contribute to cognitive decline in normal aging. This project examines the association between these factors and their relationship to cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired older adults without subjective cognitive decline.
METHODS: A total of 230 subjects with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aß42, CSF pTau181, white matter lesions (WMLs) used as a proxy of CSVD, and cognitive scores from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were included. Associations between each factor and cognitive score were investigated using regression models. Furthermore, relationships between the three pathologies were also examined using regression models.
RESULTS: At baseline, there was an inverse association between WML load and Aß42 (t = -4.20, p <.001). There was no association between WML load and pTau (t = 0.32, p = 0.75), nor with Aß42 and pTau (t = 0.51, p =.61). Correcting for age, sex and education, baseline WML load was associated with baseline ADAS-13 scores (t = 2.59, p =.01) and lower follow-up executive functioning (t = -2.84, p =.005). Baseline Aß42 was associated with executive function at baseline (t = 3.58, p<.004) but not at follow-up (t = 1.05, p = 0.30), nor with ADAS-13 at baseline (t = -0.24, p = 0.81) or follow-up (t = 0.09, p = 0.93). Finally, baseline pTau was not associated with any cognitive measure at baseline or follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Both baseline Aß42 and WML load are associated with some baseline cognition scores, but only baseline WML load is associated with follow-up executive functioning. This finding suggests that WMLs may be one of the earliest clinical manifestations that contributes to future cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older adults. Given that healthy older adults with WMLs exhibit declines in cognitive functioning, they may be less resilient to future pathology increasing their risk for cognitive impairment due to dementia than those without WMLs.","2022",,"Neuroimage Clin",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, pathology, Q000473, Biomarkers, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Cognition, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, pathology, Q000473, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Nervous System Diseases, TRUE, complications, Q000150, White Matter, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In addition to the intellectual disability associated with DS, adults with DS also have an ultrahigh risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's disease dementia. DYRK1A, a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, whose gene is located on chromosome 21, has recently emerged as a promising plasma biomarker in patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The protein DYRK1A is truncated in symptomatic AD, the increased truncated form being associated with a decrease in the level of full-length form. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), a key protein for the brain development, has been demonstrated to be a useful marker for symptomatic AD and disease progression. In this study, we evaluated DYRK1A and ADNP in CSF and plasma of adults with DS and explored the relationship between these proteins. We used mice models to evaluate the effect of DYRK1A overexpression on ADNP levels and then performed a dual-center cross-sectional human study in adults with DS in Barcelona (Spain) and Paris (France). Both cohorts included adults with DS at different stages of the continuum of AD: asymptomatic AD (aDS), prodromal AD (pDS), and AD dementia (dDS). Non-trisomic controls and patients with sporadic AD dementia were included for comparison. Full-form levels of DYRK1A were decreased in plasma and CSF in adults with DS and symptomatic AD (pDS and dDS) compared to aDS, and in patients with sporadic AD compared to controls. On the contrary, the truncated form of DYRK1A was found to increase both in CSF and plasma in adults with DS and symptomatic AD and in patients with sporadic AD with respect to aDS and controls. ADNP levels showed a more complex structure. ADNP levels increased in aDS groups vs. controls, in agreement with the increase in levels found in the brains of mice overexpressing DYRK1A. However, symptomatic individuals had lower levels than aDS individuals. Our results show that the comparison between full-length and truncated-form levels of DYRK1A coupled with ADNP levels could be used in trials targeting pathophysiological mechanisms of dementia in individuals with DS.","2022",,"Biomedicines",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

PD is associated with motor symptoms and nonmotor symptoms including depression and cognitive impairment. Past research suggests an association between depression and cognitive impairment in PD. Physical activity may have a therapeutic effect on both depression and cognitive impairment. The present study investigates if physical activity mediates the association between depressive symptoms and cognition in a longitudinal sample of individuals with PD.
METHOD: Participants include individuals newly diagnosed with PD (
RESULTS: A significant direct effect demonstrated depression was associated with worse global cognitive functioning. Furthermore, there was a significant indirect within-person effect, indicating that physical activity fully mediated the association between depression and cognition. Individuals who became more depressed over time became less physically active and subsequently experienced cognitive decline over the 5-year period.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings have implications for prognostic detection and/or the role of physical activity interventions to buffer effects of depression on cognitive impairment among individuals diagnosed with PD. Physical interventions may potentially be implemented among depressed persons to preserve cognitive functioning. Worsened depression early during PD may be a risk factor for inactivity and cognitive diminishment.

RECENT FINDINGS: Methods of acquisition and analysis of BPV and cognitive measurements and their relationship were extracted from selected articles. Of 656 studies identified, 53 articles were selected. Twenty-five evaluated long-term (LTBPV), nine mid-term (MTBPV), 12 short-term (STBPV) and nine very short-term BPV (VSTBPV) with conflicting findings on the relationship between BPV and cognition. Variations existed in devices, period and procedure for acquisition. The studies also utilized a wide range of methods of BPV calculation. Thirteen cognitive assessment tools were used to measure global cognition or domain functions which were influenced by the population of interest. The interpretation of available studies was hence limited by heterogeneity. There is an urgent need for standardization of BPV assessments to streamline research on BPV and cognition.

We aimed to evaluate the associations between frailty profiles, both severity and subtype, and dementia risk in a community-based population with asymptomatic (without stroke and dementia) cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).
METHODS: Individuals with asymptomatic CSVD were recruited from the community-based I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study between 2011 and 2014 (baseline) and were followed up between 2018 and 2019. All participants underwent CSVD assessment by 3T brain MRI, as well as physical and cognitive assessments at baseline. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between each factor and dementia conversion at follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 261 participants with asymptomatic CSVD (64.8 [50.0-89.1, 8.4] years; 136 [52.1%] men), 13 (5.0%) developed dementia during a mean follow-up of 5.7 (0.7) years. Dementia converters were less likely to be robust (30.8% vs. 61.5%) and more likely to be pre-frail/frail (69.2% vs. 38.5%) than non-converters (p = 0.040). Meanwhile, there was significantly more frequent mobility frailty (53.8% vs. 19.8%, p = 0.009), but a similar prevalence of non-mobility frailty in dementia converters compared with non-converters. Univariate analyses showed that neither frailty severity nor CSVD burden was associated with a higher risk of dementia; it was the frailty subtype, the mobility frailty, which was significantly associated with dementia conversion in participants with asymptomatic CSVD, with an odds-ratio of 4.8 (95% CI = 1.5-14.8, p = 0.007). The significance remained after adjusting for age, sex, education and baseline cognitive function, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Mobility frailty was associated with a higher risk of incident dementia in individuals with subclinical CSVD.

Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) are characteristic of SVD; however, a direct association between MR-proADM and MBs has not been explored.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine whether circulating levels of MR-proADM are associated with the identification of MBs by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and whether this association could be linked with cognitive impairment.
METHODS: In total, 214 participants (mean age: 75.9 years) without history of cerebral infarction or dementia were prospectively enrolled. All participants underwent brain MRI, higher cognitive function testing, blood biochemistry evaluation, lifestyle examination, and blood MR-proADM measurement using a time-resolved amplified cryptate emission technology assay. For between-group comparisons, the participants were divided into two groups according to whether their levels of MR-proADM were normal (< 0.65 nmol/L) or high (≥0.65 nmol/L).
RESULTS: The mean MR-proADM level was 0.515±0.127 nmol/L. There were significant between-group differences in age, hypertension, and HbA1c levels (p < 0.05). In the high MR-proADM group, the MR-proADM level was associated with the identification of MBs on brain MR images and indications of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In participants with ≥3 MBs and MCI, high MR-proADM levels remained a risk factor after multivariate adjustment (OR: 2.94; p < 0.05).

METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 16 non-demented carriers of the Presenilin1 E280A ADAD mutation (mean age [SD]: 40.1 [5.3], and 19 non-carrier family members (mean age [SD]: 36.0 [5.5]) from Colombia, who completed olfactory and cognitive testing and underwent amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.
RESULTS: Worse olfactory identification performance was associated with greater age in mutation carriers (r = -0.52 p = 0.037). In carriers, worse olfactory identification performance was related to worse MMSE scores (r = 0.55, p = 0.024) and CERAD delayed recall (r = 0.63, p = 0.007) and greater cortical amyloid-β (r = -0.53, p = 0.042) and tau pathology burden (entorhinal: r = -0.59, p = 0.016; inferior temporal: r = -0.52, p = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Worse performance on olfactory identification tasks was associated with greater age, a proxy for disease progression in this genetically vulnerable ADAD cohort.

Its isobaric structural isomer, galactosylsphingosine (GalSph, psychosine), is also used as a diagnostic blood marker in Krabbe disease (KD) which is caused by a deficiency in β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). However, there are no reports of GlcSph quantification in the CSF of GBA-PD patients and normal healthy humans due to low concentrations. In this study, we successfully quantified GlcSph in healthy human CSF using a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method with separation of GalSph. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.1 pg/mL. Additionally, GlcSph and GalSph concentrations in the plasma and brain were determined using different LC-MS/MS methods. The mean concentrations of GlcSph and GalSph in normal human CSF were 1.07 and 9.44 pg/mL, respectively. The GalSph level in the CSF and brain was higher than that of GlcSph, whereas plasma GalSph was lower than GlcSph. Because GCase and GALC are expressed in the brain and the peripheral tissues, GlcSph and GalSph in CSF would be a good surrogate of concentration change in the brain by targeted therapies.

We report a genome-wide association study and a whole-exome association study on a composite extreme phenotype of cerebral small vessel disease derived from its most common MRI features: white matter hyperintensities and lacunes. Seventeen population-based cohorts of older persons with MRI measurements and genome-wide genotyping (n = 41 326), whole-exome sequencing (n = 15 965), or exome chip (n = 5249) data contributed 13 776 and 7079 extreme small vessel disease samples for the genome-wide association study and whole-exome association study, respectively. The genome-wide association study identified significant association of common variants in 11 loci with extreme small vessel disease, of which the chr12q24.11 locus was not previously reported to be associated with any MRI marker of cerebral small vessel disease. The whole-exome association study identified significant associations of extreme small vessel disease with common variants in the 5' UTR region of EFEMP1 (chr2p16.1) and one probably damaging common missense variant in TRIM47 (chr17q25.1). Mendelian randomization supports the causal association of extensive small vessel disease severity with increased risk of stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Combined evidence from summary-based Mendelian randomization studies and profiling of human loss-of-function allele carriers showed an inverse relation between TRIM47 expression in the brain and blood vessels and extensive small vessel disease severity. We observed significant enrichment of Trim47 in isolated brain vessel preparations compared to total brain fraction in mice, in line with the literature showing Trim47 enrichment in brain endothelial cells at single cell level. Functional evaluation of TRIM47 by small interfering RNAs-mediated knockdown in human brain endothelial cells showed increased endothelial permeability, an important hallmark of cerebral small vessel disease pathology. Overall, our comprehensive gene-mapping study and preliminary functional evaluation suggests a putative role of TRIM47 in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease, making it an important candidate for extensive in vivo explorations and future translational work.","2022",,"Brain",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Brain Ischemia, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Endothelial Cells, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Genome-Wide Association Study, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Stroke, TRUE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The aging process runs with the enlargement of ventricles and is related to a less selective blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and then a more toxic cerebrospinal fluid environment. The study of brain ventricles as a biological marker of aging is promissing because they are structures easily identified in neuroimaging studies, present good inter-rater reliability, and measures of them can identify brain atrophy earlier than cortical structures. The ventricular system also plays roles in the development of dementia, since dysfunction in the clearance of beta-amyloid protein is a key mechanism in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. The morphometric and volumetric studies of the brain ventricles can help to distinguish between healthy elderly and persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Brain ventricle data may contribute to the appropriate allocation of individuals in groups at higher risk for MCI-dementia progression in clinical trials and to measuring therapeutic responses in these studies, as well as providing differential diagnosis, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Optimizing thresholds for classification increased the diagnosis prediction accuracy and other metrics. Finally, networks were built to identify gene communities specific to PD. Combining data modalities outperforms the single biomarker paradigm.

METHODS: This is a longitudinal analysis of the Dementia Disease Initiation Study, a prospective, community-based, cohort study from Norway, designed to investigate early markers of cognitive impairment and dementia. Participants were classified as SCD and healthy controls (HC). The main studied variables were the TUG test and cognition as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease memory composite score. Additionally, we investigated the cross-sectional association of brain morphology with the TUG using 1.5T-MRI.
RESULTS: The sample included 45 participants (SCD = 21, HC = 24) followed during a mean time of 1.50 ± 0.70 years. At baseline, the cognitive performance did not differ between the groups, but TUG was longer in SCD. Slower baseline TUG was associated with a faster cognitive decline in both groups and it was also associated with reduced cortical thickness especially in motor, executive, associative, and somatosensory cortical regions in people with SCD.

The meta analysis showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity for TCS in the differential diagnosis of PD versus ET of 84.6% (95% CI, 79.4-88.6%) and 83.9% (95% CI, 78.4-88.2%), respectively. Furthermore, we found nearly similar results in sensitivity and specificity comparing TCS and DaTSCAN in a subgroup-analysis of three studies using both diagnostic tools including 107 patients with PD and 62 patients with ET. The QUADAS-2 toolbox revealed a high risk of bias regarding the methodological quality of patient selection.
CONCLUSION: Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity yield high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of PD from ET.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether PTFV1 is associated with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) markers and etiological subtypes of cognitive impairment and dementia.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from ongoing memory clinic study between August 2010 to January 2019. All participants underwent physical and medical evaluation along with an electrocardiography and 3 T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were classified as no cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment no dementia, vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, and dementia subtypes (Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia). Elevated PTFV1 was defined as > 4,000μV×ms and measured manually on ECG.
RESULTS: Of 408 participants, 78 (19.1%) had elevated PTFV1 (37 women [47%]; mean [SD] age, 73.8 [7.2] years). The participants with elevated PTFV1 had higher burden of lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMB), and cortical microinfarcts. As for the CMB location, persons with strictly deep CMB and mixed CMB had significantly higher PTFV1 than those with no CMB (p = 0.005, p = 0.007). Regardless of adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and/or heart diseases, elevated PTFV1 was significantly associated with presence of CMB (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% CI,1.33-3.91).

We performed an exome-wide rare variant analysis of six AD biomarkers (β-amyloid, total/phosphorylated tau, NfL, YKL-40, and Neurogranin) to discover genes associated with these markers. Genetic and biomarker information was available for 480 participants from two studies: EMIF-AD and ADNI. We applied a principal component (PC) analysis to derive biomarkers combinations, which represent statistically independent biological processes. We then tested whether rare variants in 9576 protein-coding genes associate with these PCs using a Meta-SKAT test. We also tested whether the PCs are intermediary to gene effects on AD symptoms with a SMUT test. One PC loaded on NfL and YKL-40, indicators of neuronal injury and inflammation. Four genes were associated with this PC: IFFO1, DTNB, NLRC3, and SLC22A10. Mediation tests suggest, that these genes also affect dementia symptoms via inflammation/injury. We also observed an association between a PC loading on Neurogranin, a marker for synaptic functioning, with GABBR2 and CASZ1, but no mediation effects. The results suggest that rare variants in IFFO1, DTNB, NLRC3, and SLC22A10 heighten susceptibility to neuronal injury and inflammation, potentially by altering cytoskeleton structure and immune activity disinhibition, resulting in an elevated dementia risk. GABBR2 and CASZ1 were associated with synaptic functioning, but mediation analyses suggest that the effect of these two genes on synaptic functioning is not consequential for AD development.","2022",,"Mol Psychiatry",,"other","Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Biomarkers, FALSE, Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA-Binding Proteins, FALSE, Dithionitrobenzoic Acid, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Inflammation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, FALSE, Neurogranin, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Transcription Factors, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine high pesticide exposure events reported from 1993 to 1997 in relation to dream-enacting behaviors assessed from 2013 to 2015 among 11,248 farmers (age 47 ± 11 years).
RESULTS: A history of dream-enacting behaviors was reported by 939 (8.3%) farmers. Compared with farmers who did not report any high pesticide exposure event, those who reported were more likely to endorse dream-enacting behaviors 2 decades later (odds ratio = 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-2.05).

However, their clinical relevance in midlife adults at risk of future dementia remains unclear. We investigated whether the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing and Dementia (CAIDE) risk score was associated with markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), and if it predicted future progression of SVD. We also determined its relationship to systemic inflammation, which has been additionally implicated in dementia and SVD.
METHODS: Cognitively healthy midlife participants were assessed at baseline (n=185) and 2-year follow-up (n=158). To assess SVD, we quantified white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), microbleeds and lacunes. We derived composite scores of SVD burden, and subtypes of hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Inflammation was quantified using serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen.
RESULTS: At baseline, higher CAIDE scores were associated with all markers of SVD and inflammation. Longitudinally, CAIDE scores predicted greater total (p<0.001), periventricular (p<0.001) and deep (p=0.012) WMH progression, and increased CRP (p=0.017). Assessment of individual CAIDE components suggested that markers were driven by different risk factors (WMH/EPVS: age/hypertension, lacunes/deep microbleeds: hypertension/obesity). Interaction analyses demonstrated that higher CAIDE scores amplified the effect of age on SVD, and the effect of WMH on poorer memory.
CONCLUSION: Higher CAIDE scores, indicating greater risk of dementia, predicts future progression of both WMH and systemic inflammation.

Recent developments in the field of Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathophysiology have led to a renewed interest in this field. As an antioxidant, uric acid (UA) has arisen as a potential neuroprotectant. Higher concentrations of UA are linked to reducing the risk of the development of the disease and preventing its progression. However, the expositions are unsatisfactory because the outcomes of these reports have not been consistent. This study is set out to assess the association of whether lower UA concentrations increased the PD risk by investigating its relationship with patients' demographic and clinical data, and to determine whether previous studies are compatible with the Turkish-sampled population. Furthermore, we aimed to determine UA's probability of being an early-stage diagnostic marker.
METHODS: A total of 305 patients and 100 healthy controls were included. Serum UA levels of patients and controls were compared with clinical features. We classified the patients into three motor subtypes and determined the disease severity by modified Hoehn&Yahr Staging Scale (mH&Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-TR) was assessed for cognition.
RESULTS: There were not any significant differences of age and sex between patients and controls (p=0.030, p=0.132). The mean UA was 5.06±1.33 mg/dL in patients and 5.46±1.44 in controls, and a statistical significance was detected (p=0.022). The mean MMSE-TR were 24.83±4.35 in patients and 27.09±2.13 in controls, and statictical significance was revealed (p=0.001). The mean duration of the disease was 6.31±4.16 years, mean UPDRS scores were 59.74±22.33, and mH&Y scores were 2.29±0.91. In binary comparisons, patients with tremor-dominant motor subtype had lower UA concentrations than controls (p=0.014). ROC curve analysis revealed UA's cut-off as ≤9.15, the specificity was 99.3, the sensitivity was 10.0, and the area under the curve was 0.576 (p<0.005). Regression analysis revealed age as an independent risk factor on UA values. Oxidative stress might be a factor in the development of PD, and UA may be a possible prospective protecting factor in the clinical course of the disease. However, it does not affect the severity.
CONCLUSION: Our results support that lower uric acid concentrations are associated with PD; however, it is not a powerful indicator for predicting PD risk.

Using this window of opportunity will require early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease pathology at predementia stages, thus allowing identification of patients who will most probably progress to dementia of the Alzheimer's type and benefit from specific disease-modifying therapies. Consequently, we searched for CSF proteins associated with disease progression along with the clinical disease staging. We measured the levels of 184 proteins in CSF samples from 556 subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment patients from three independent memory clinic longitudinal studies (Spanish ACE, n = 410; German DCN, n = 93; German Mannheim, n = 53). We evaluated the association between protein levels and clinical stage, and the effect of protein levels on the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Mild cognitive impairment subjects with increased CSF level of matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP-10) showed a higher probability of progressing to dementia of the Alzheimer's type and a faster cognitive decline. CSF MMP-10 increased the prediction accuracy of CSF amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42), phospho-tau 181 (P-tau181) and total tau (T-tau) for conversion to dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Including MMP-10 to the [A/T/(N)] scheme improved considerably the prognostic value in mild cognitive impairment patients with abnormal Aβ42, but normal P-tau181 and T-tau, and in mild cognitive impairment patients with abnormal Aβ42, P-tau181 and T-tau. MMP-10 was correlated with age in subjects with normal Aβ42, P-tau181 and T-tau levels.

However, most patients will develop debilitating motor levodopa-induced complications (MLIC) in the form of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) and/or motor fluctuations (MF). This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the pharmacogenetic association between LID and MF with common genetic variants of the dopamine metabolic and signaling pathways.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Extracted studies include case-control studies evaluating the association between SLC6A3/DAT rs28363170 and rs393795; COMT rs4680 and rs4633; MAO-B rs1799836, BDNF rs6265, DRD1 rs4532, DRD2 rs1800497, DRD3 rs6280, and DRD5 rs6283 polymorphisms; and the overall risk of MLIC and its subtypes LID or MF. Genotypic frequency were tested for deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and the genetic association was examined using the allelic (a vs. A), recessive (aa vs. Aa + AA), dominant (aa + Aa vs. AA), overdominant (Aa vs. aa + AA), homozygous (aa vs. AA), and heterozygous (Aa vs. AA and aa vs. aA) models.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. A significant association was found between COMT rs46809 polymorphisms with LID but not MF, with the association observable in Asians but not Caucasians. In Asians, the COMT rs4633 was significantly associated with the occurrence of both LID and MF. The MAO-B rs1799836 was associated with both MF and LID.

We examined the association of pathologic markers of SVD, specifically arteriolosclerosis in watershed brain regions, with AD pathologic changes. Participants (N = 982; mean age-at-death = 90; 69% women) were enrolled as part of one of two cohort studies of aging and dementia. At autopsy, neuropathological evaluation included semi-quantitative grading of arteriolosclerosis pathology from 2 cortical watershed regions: the anterior watershed (AWS) and posterior watershed (PWS), densities for cortical β-amyloid and tau-tangle pathology, and other common age-related pathologies. Linear regression models examined the association of watershed arteriolosclerosis pathology with β-amyloid and tau-tangle burden. In follow-up analyses, available ex-vivo MRI and proteomics data in a subset of decedents were leveraged to examine the association of whole brain measure of WMH, as a presumed MRI marker of SVD, with β-amyloid and tau-tangle burden, as well as to examine the association of watershed arteriolosclerosis with proteomic tau. Watershed arteriolosclerosis was common, with 45% of older persons having moderate-to-severe arteriolosclerosis pathology in the AWS region, and 35% in the PWS. In fully adjusted models that controlled for demographics and common age-related pathologies, an increase in severity of PWS arteriolosclerosis was associated with a higher burden of tau-tangle burden, specifically neocortical tau burden, but not with β-amyloid. AWS arteriolosclerosis was not associated with β-amyloid or tau pathology. Ex-vivo WMH was associated with greater tau-tangle pathology burden but not β-amyloid.

While some of the hereditary genetic risk factors can be connected to the known amyloid and tau hypothesis, many treatments targeting this pathophysiology have failed in clinical trials or ineffectiveness of the drugs are attributed to the heterogeneous and multifactorial nature of AD. Thus, there is an urgent need to focus on finding therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease progression on patient based personalized medicine. This approach of precision medicine can tailor the potential treatment to a specific individual, so it is optimized for the maximum efficacy with minimum risk of side effects. To be able to understand varying responses among patients, identifying biomarkers that can be used as the therapeutic effectiveness will be of great interest.

The mild behavioral impairment (MBI) diagnostic framework was designed to standardize assessment to determine dementia risk better. In this Mini Review, we summarize the emerging clinical and biomarker evidence, which suggests that for some, MBI is a marker of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. MAIN: MBI is generally more common in those with greater cognitive impairment. In community and clinical samples, frequency is around 10-15%. Mounting evidence in cognitively normal samples links MBI symptoms with known AD biomarkers for amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration, as well as AD risk genes. Clinical studies have found detectable differences in cognition associated with MBI in cognitively unimpaired people.

Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provides new ways to remotely monitor patients within the comfort of their homes, particularly important for the timely delivery of appropriate healthcare. Presented here is data collated as part of the on-going UK Dementia Research Institute's Care Research and Technology Centre cohort and Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) study. There are two main aims to this work: first, to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 quarantine on the performance of daily living activities of PLWD, on which there is currently little research; and second, to create a simple classification model capable of effectively predicting agitation risk in PLWD, allowing for the generation of alerts with actionable information by which to prevent such outcomes.
METHOD: A within-subject, date-matched study was conducted on daily living activity data using the first COVID-19 quarantine as a natural experiment. Supervised machine learning approaches were then applied to combined physiological and environmental data to create two simple classification models: a single marker model trained using ambient temperature as a feature, and a multi-marker model using ambient temperature, body temperature, movement, and entropy as features.
RESULT: There are 102 PLWD total included in the dataset, with all patients having an established diagnosis of dementia, but with ranging types and severity. The COVID-19 study was carried out on a sub-group of 21 patient households. In 2020, PLWD had a significant increase in daily household activity (p = 1.40e-08), one-way repeated measures ANOVA). Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the pandemic quarantine and patient gender on night-time bed-occupancy duration (p = 3.00e-02, two-way mixed-effect ANOVA). On evaluating the models using 10-fold cross validation, both the single and multi-marker model were shown to balance precision and recall well, having F1-scores of 0.80 and 0.66, respectively.

However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have evaluated to what extent the presence of chronic and early NPS impacts cognition and functionality in patients with minor or major stages of NCD.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the interplay between early and chronic NPS and cognitive and functional presentation of patients with mild and major forms of NCD.
METHODS: We used two NPS tools tracking early and late NPS and assessed to what extent they determine cognitive and functional outcomes in patients with mild and major forms of NCD.
RESULTS: We found an inverse relationship between the presence of NPS, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), and cognitive and functional variables in major forms of NCD. In contrast, the minor stage of NCD was associated with increased MBI-C scores.
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that NPS are associated with cognitive and functional outcomes in mild and chronic forms of NCD. Crucially our results suggest that NPS could be considered as a pathological marker of the clinical course of dementia.

Apathy commonly develops in PD and may be a pathway through which depressive symptoms negatively influence cognition. Prior research examining depressive symptoms, apathy, and cognition in PD is limited by being predominantly cross-sectional. This study examined the role of apathy as a within- and between-person mediator for the longitudinal relationships between depression severity and cognitive functioning in patients with early PD.
METHODS: Participants included 487 individuals newly diagnosed with PD followed annually for up to 5 years by the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative. At each visit, participants completed depressive symptom measures, apathy ratings, and cognitive tests. Multi-level structural equation models examined both the within- and between-person effects of depressive symptoms on cognition through apathy, controlling for demographics and motor severity.
RESULTS: At the within-person level, apathy mediated the association between depressive symptoms and select cognitive functions (global cognition, attention/working memory, visuospatial functions, and immediate verbal memory; indirect effects, bootstrap p's <0.05). Significant between-person direct effects were found for depressive symptoms predicting apathy (boostrap p <0.001) and lower scores on most cognitive tests (bootstrap p's <0.05). However, the indirect effects did not reach significance, suggesting between-person mediation did not occur.

OBJECTIVE: We determined the association between peripheral immune cell numbers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and prevalent as well as incident PD.
METHODS: This study was embedded in the population-based setting of the Rotterdam Study. We repeatedly measured peripheral immune cell numbers (differential leukocyte count and platelet count, granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio [GLR], platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR], and adapted systemic immune-inflammation index [adapted SII]) and CRP between 1990 and 2016.

Despite these findings, the association of PENK-A with ischemic stroke is unknown, so we examined this association in a prospective cohort study and analyzed differences by race and sex.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS) is a prospective cohort study of 30,239 Black and White adults. Plasma PENK-A was measured in 473 participants that developed first-time ischemic stroke over 5.9 years and 899 randomly selected participants. Cox models adjusted for demographics and stroke risk factors were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke by baseline PENK-A.
RESULTS: PENK-A was higher with increasing age, female sex, White race, lower body mass index, and antihypertensive medication use. Each SD higher increment of PENK-A was associated with an adjusted HR of 1.20 (95% CI 1.01-1.42) for stroke, with minimal confounding by stroke risk factors. Spline plots suggested a U-shaped relationship, particularly in White men, with an adjusted HR 3.88 (95% CI 1.94-7.77) for the 95
CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline plasma PENK-A was independently associated with future stroke risk in REGARDS. This association was most apparent among White men.

Although several risk factors that include older age, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression, and cognitive dysfunction have been identified, the exact neural correlates remain elusive. As cognitive impairment has a close association with psychosis in PD, it is useful to know the spectrum of cognitive impairment in PD patients with psychosis (PD-P).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study compared various cognitive parameters of PD-P (visual/minor hallucinations) and PD patients with no psychosis (PD-NP). A neuropsychological battery encapsulating several cognitive domains (executive, visuospatial, learning, and memory) was used for the cognitive assessment of 37 PD-P and 51 PD-NP patients who were matched for age, gender, education, and disease duration.
RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in terms of disease severity and stage. Although the groups had a comparable mean score on Montreal cognitive assessment, the PD-P group performed poorly in tests focused on executive function (color trail test, forward digit span), verbal learning and memory (Rey auditory and verbal learning test), and visuospatial functions (complex figure test, corsi block tapping test). Those with complex visual hallucinations performed poorly in the color trial test (part A) compared to those with minor hallucinations.
CONCLUSION: Psychosis is associated with a multidomain cognitive dysfunction in PD.

AIM: This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to study the relationship between CIMT, dementia, and CI.
METHODS: The literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included the following databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos. The search spanned from 2000 to 2020 and was limited to English and Scandinavian languages.
RESULTS: The main analysis of CIMT in subjects with CI compared to subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI) included 12 studies; 1,089 subjects with CI and 5,223 with NCI.

Anatomically and developmentally, the retina is an extension of the brain, and is the only part of the central nervous system that can be imaged non-invasively. Therefore, retinal imaging has potential as a potential biomarker for dementia. Previous studies have demonstrated that inner retinal thinning (measured using optical coherence tomography [OCT]) is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including AD.

However, CRF is not routinely measured and PA not routinely prescribed as part of standard healthcare. The American Heart Association (AHA) recently presented a scientific case for the inclusion of CRF as a clinical vital sign based on epidemiological and clinical observation. Here, we leverage genetic data in the UK Biobank (UKB) to strengthen the case for CRF as a vital sign and make a case for the prescription of PA.
METHODS: We derived two CRF measures from the heart rate data collected during a submaximal cycle ramp test: CRF-vo2max, an estimate of the participants' maximum volume of oxygen uptake, per kilogram of body weight, per minute; and CRF-slope, an estimate of the rate of increase of heart rate during exercise. Average PA over a 7-day period was derived from a wrist-worn activity tracker. After quality control, 70,783 participants had data on the two derived CRF measures, and 89,683 had PA data. We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses by sex, and post-GWAS techniques to understand genetic architecture of the traits and prioritise functional genes for follow-up.
RESULTS: We found strong evidence that genetic variants associated with CRF and PA influenced genetic expression in a relatively small set of genes in the heart, artery, lung, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These functionally relevant genes were enriched among genes known to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (three of the top 10 causes of death in high-income countries) as well as Parkinson's disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory phenotypes. Genetic variation associated with lower CRF and PA was also correlated with several disease risk factors (including greater body mass index, body fat and multiple obesity phenotypes); a typical T2D profile (including higher insulin resistance, higher fasting glucose, impaired beta-cell function, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridemia); increased risk for CAD and T2D; and a shorter lifespan.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetics supports three decades of evidence for the inclusion of CRF as a clinical vital sign. Given the genetic, clinical and epidemiological evidence linking CRF and PA to increased morbidity and mortality, regular measurement of CRF as a marker of health and routine prescription of PA could be a prudent strategy to support public health.","2021",,"Genome Med",,"other","Adipose Tissue, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, Body Mass Index, FALSE, Body Weight, FALSE, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Delivery of Health Care, TRUE, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, FALSE, Exercise, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Female, FALSE, Genome-Wide Association Study, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Insulin Resistance, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Obesity, FALSE, Phenotype, FALSE, Prescriptions, TRUE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Vital Signs, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We investigated if the cross-sectional relationship of self-reported SCD with objective cognition varies as a function of ethnic background (Latinos/as versus Non-Hispanic Whites [NHWs]). Secondary analyses conducted solely within the Latino/a group investigated if informant reported SCD is associated with objective cognition and whether self-reported SCD is related to markers of brain health in a sub-sample of Latinos/as with available MRI data.
METHODS: Eighty-three participants (≥60 years of age) without dementia (35 Latinos/as; 48 NHWs) completed the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) and the Subjective Cognitive Decline-Questionnaire (SCD-Q). Additionally, 22 Latino/a informants completed the informant-version of the SCD-Q. Hierarchical regression models investigated if ethnicity moderates the association of MDRS and SCD-Q scores after adjusting for demographics and depressive symptoms. Correlational analyses within the Latino/a group investigated self- and informant-reported associations of SCD-Q scores with objective cognition, and associations of self-reported SCD-Q scores with medial temporal lobe volume and thickness.
RESULTS: Latinos/as had lower education and MDRS scores than NHWs. Higher SCD-Q scores were associated with lower MDRS scores only in Latinos/as. Within the Latino/a group, self, but not informant reported SCD was related to objective cognition. Medium to large effect sizes were found whereby higher self-reported SCD was associated with lower entorhinal cortex thickness and left hippocampal volume in Latinos/as.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of SCD and concurrent objectively measured global cognition varied by ethnic background and was only significant in Latinos/as.

Revascularization procedures such as carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting aim to reduce occurrence of stroke in selected patients. Due to the proven benefit and low intraoperative risk, CEA is currently the preferred choice in candidates for carotid revascularization. However, the risk of cognitive impairment subsequent to CEA has not been fully elucidated and is unclear whether certain conditions, such as frailty, may increase this risk. There is consistent evidence that shows that frail patients have higher risk of cognitive impairment after surgical procedure. Moreover, brain pre-existing conditions may play a role in cognitive impairment after CEA. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a pathology that involves microcirculation and is detectable with computed tomography or magnetic resonance. SVD shares common vascular risk factors with carotid atherosclerosis, is a major contributor to vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia, and has been proposed as a marker of brain frailty. In this review, we discuss the current evidence about the link between carotid revascularization and cognitive impairment and advance the hypothesis that SVD may play a relevant role in development of cognitive impairment after carotid revascularization.","2022",,"Neurol Sci"," Revascularization procedures such as carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) and carotid stenting aim to reduce occurrence of stroke in selected patients "," review","Carotid Arteries, FALSE, Carotid Stenosis, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, Endarterectomy, Carotid, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009, Humans, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Stents, FALSE, Stroke, TRUE, Treatment Outcome, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

MCI and ADRD screening would be most beneficial if detection measures reflect neurodegenerative changes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) could be a marker of neurodegeneration (part of the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) framework).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether OCT measurements can be used as a screening measure to detect individuals with MCI and ADRD.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on 136 participants with comprehensive clinical, cognitive, functional, and behavioral evaluations including OCT with a subset (n = 76) completing volumetric MRI. Pearson correlation coefficients tested strength of association between OCT and outcome measures. Receiver operator characteristic curves assessed the ability of OCT, patient-reported outcomes, and cognitive performance measures to discriminate between individuals with and without cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: After controlling for age, of the 6 OCT measurements collected, granular cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL + IPL) thickness best correlated with memory, global cognitive performance, Clinical Dementia Rating, and hippocampal atrophy. GCL + IPL thickness provided good discrimination in cognitive status with a cut-off score of 75μm. Combining GCL + IPL thickness as a proxy marker for hippocampal atrophy with a brief patient-reported outcome and performance measure correctly classified 87%of MCI and ADRD participants.
CONCLUSION: Multimodal approaches may improve recognition of MCI and ADRD. OCT has the potential to be a practical, non-invasive biomarker for ADRD providing a screening platform to quickly identify at-risk individuals for further clinical evaluation or research enrollment.","2021",,"J Alzheimers Dis"," OBJECTIVE : To determine whether OCT measurements can be used as a screening measure to detect individuals with MCI and ADRD ","other","Aged, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mass Screening, TRUE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, TRUE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Tomography, Optical Coherence, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

This systematic review explores the epidemiology, clinical and prognostic associations, radiological features, and pathological findings associated with MPS in older adults free from neurodegenerative disease. We find that MPS as currently defined are strongly associated with increasing age and increased risk of development of Parkinson's disease (PD), all-cause dementia, disability, and death. Positive associations with later PD are found mainly in younger populations and those with other features of prodromal PD. There are currently no consistent radiological findings for MPS, and pathological studies have shown that MPS, at least in the oldest old, are often underpinned by mixed neuropathologies, including those associated with Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, nigral neuronal loss, and Lewy bodies. Different subcategories of MPS appear to convey varying risk and specificity for PD and other outcomes. MPS overall are not specific for parkinsonian disorders and, although associated with increased risk of PD, can reflect multiple pathologies, particularly in older individuals.

We investigate whether LRs for specific test values could enhance classification between PD and controls. PD patient data on smell (UPSIT), possible RBD (RBD Screening Questionnaire), and anxiety/depression (LADS) were taken from the Tracking Parkinson's study (n = 1046). For motor impairment (BRAIN test) in PD cases, published data were supplemented (n = 87). Control data (HADS for anxiety/depression) were taken from the PREDICT-PD pilot study (n = 1314). UPSIT, RBDSQ, and anxiety/depression data were analysed using logistic regression to determine which items were associated with PD. Gaussian distributions were fitted to BRAIN test scores. LRs were calculated from logistic regression models or score distributions. False-positive rates (FPRs) for specified detection rates (DRs) were calculated. Sixteen odours were associated with PD; LRs for this set ranged from 0.005 to 5511.

According to the common-cause hypothesis, there is also a significant association between cognitive and physical function in older adults. Some specific cognitive functions have been shown to be associated with grip strength trajectories with most research solely focused on cutoff points or mean cognitive performance. In the present study, we examine whether a measure of cognitive dispersion might be more informative. We therefore used an index that quantifies dispersion in cognitive scores across multiple cognitive tests, shown to be associated with detrimental outcomes in older adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using repeated grip strength measures from men and women aged 80 and older, free of dementia in the OCTO-Twin study, we estimated aging-related grip strength trajectories. We examined the association of cognitive dispersion and mean cognitive function with grip strength level and aging-related rate of change, accounting for known risk factors.
RESULTS: Cognitive dispersion was associated with grip strength trajectories in men and the association varied by mean cognitive performance, whereas we found no association in women.

Pathophysiological understanding of the pre-clinical or early prodromal stages of PD are essential for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Two categories of patients are ideal to study the early disease stages. Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) represents a well-known prodromal stage of PD in which pathology is presumed to have reached the lower brainstem. The majority of patients with iRBD will develop manifest PD within years to decades. Another category encompasses non-manifest mutation carriers, i.e. subjects without symptoms, but with a known mutation or genetic variant which gives an increased risk of developing PD. The speed of progression from preclinical or prodromal to full clinical stages varies among patients and cannot be reliably predicted on the individual level. Clinical trials will require inclusion of patients with a predictable conversion within a limited time window. Biomarkers are necessary that can confirm pre-motor PD status and can provide information regarding lead time and speed of progression. Neuroimaging changes occur early in the disease process and may provide such a biomarker. Studies have focused on radiotracer imaging of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, which can be assessed with dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Loss of DAT binding represents an effect of irreversible structural damage to the nigrostriatal system. This marker can be used to monitor disease progression and identify individuals at specific risk for phenoconversion.

Declining functional mobility may be an early indicator of loss of brain network integration and may lead to an increased risk of experiencing falls. It is unknown whether measures of functional mobility and falls are preclinical markers of AD. The purpose of this study is to examine (1) the relationship between falls and functional mobility with AD biomarkers to determine when falls occur within the temporal progression to symptomatic Alzheimer disease, and (2) the attentional compared with perceptual/motor systems that underlie falls and functional mobility changes seen with AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This longitudinal cohort study will be conducted at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Approximately 350 cognitively normal participants (with and without preclinical AD) will complete an in-home visit every year for 4 years. During each yearly assessment, functional mobility will be assessed using the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment, Timed Up and Go, and Timed Up and Go dual task. Data regarding falls (including number and severity) will be collected monthly by self-report and confirmed through interviews. This study will leverage ongoing neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging (including molecular imaging using positron emission tomography and MRI) performed by the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Relationships between falls and biomarkers of amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration will be evaluated.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board (reference number 201807135). Written informed consent will be obtained in the home prior to the collection of any study data. Results will be published in peer-reviewed publications and presented at national and international conferences.

Hence, the aim of this study was to determine whether risk factors of Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (clinical AD), such as body mass index (BMI), are associated with Aβ misfolding in blood, a strong risk marker for AD among older adults.
METHODS: Information on risk factors and blood samples were collected at baseline in the ESTHER study, a population-based cohort study of older adults (age 50-75 years) in Germany. Aβ misfolding in blood plasma was analyzed using an immuno-infrared-sensor in a total of 872 participants in a nested case-control design among incident dementia cases and matched controls. Associations between risk factors and Aβ misfolding were assessed by multiple logistic regression. For comparison, the association between the risk factors and AD incidence during 17 years of follow-up was investigated in parallel among 5987 cohort participants.
RESULTS: An inverse association with Aβ misfolding was seen for BMI at age 50 based on reported weight history (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.96, p = 0.03). Similar but not statistically significant associations were seen for BMI at baseline (i.e., mean age 68) and at age 40. No statistically significant associations with Aβ misfolding were found for other risk factors, such as diabetes, smoking, and physical activity. On the other hand, low physical activity was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing clinical AD compared to physical inactivity.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between olfactory brain structures and olfactory function in adults 30 years or older and to examine the extent to which olfactory bulb volume (OBV) mediates the association between central olfactory structures and olfactory function.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed baseline data from the first 639 participants with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the Rhineland Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled between March 7, 2016, and October 31, 2017, and underwent brain MRI and olfactory assessment. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2018, to June 30, 2021.
EXPOSURE: Volumetric measures were derived from 3-T MRI T1-weighted brain scans, and OBV was manually segmented on T2-weighted images. The mean volumetric brain measures from the right and left sides were calculated, adjusted by head size, and normalized to all participants.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance on the 12-item smell identification test (SIT-12) was used as a proxy for olfactory function.
RESULTS: A total of 541 participants with complete data on MRI-derived measures and SIT-12 scores were included. This population had a mean (SD) age of 53.6 (13.1) years and comprised 306 women (56.6%). Increasing age (difference in SIT-12 score, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.05 to -0.03), male sex (-0.26; 95% CI, -0.54 to 0.02), and nasal congestion (-0.28; 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.09) were associated with worse olfactory function (SIT-12 scores). Conversely, larger OBV was associated with better olfactory function (difference in SIT-12 score, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.64). Larger volumes of amygdala (difference in OBV, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.24), hippocampus (0.16; 95% CI, 0.04-0.28), insular cortex (0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.24), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (0.10; 95% CI, 0.00-0.20) were associated with larger OBV. Larger volumes of amygdala (volume × age interaction effect, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.30), parahippocampal cortex (0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.31), and hippocampus (0.21; 95% CI, 0.08-0.35) were associated with better olfactory function only in older age groups. The age-modified association between volumes of central olfactory structures and olfactory function was largely mediated through OBV.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that olfactory bulb volume was independently associated with odor identification function and was a robust mediator of the age-dependent association between volumes of central olfactory structures and olfactory function. Thus, neurodegeneration-associated olfactory dysfunction may primarily originate from the pathology of peripheral olfactory structures, suggesting that OBV may serve as a preclinical marker for the identification of individuals who are at an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases.","2021",,"JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg"," OBJECTIVE : To assess the association between olfactory brain structures and olfactory function in adults 30 years or older and to examine the extent to which olfactory bulb volume ( OBV ) mediates the association between central olfactory structures and olfactory function ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Amygdala, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Germany, FALSE, Hippocampus, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Olfaction Disorders, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Olfactory Bulb, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Organ Size, FALSE, Prefrontal Cortex, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Recent evidence suggests that carotid artery atherosclerosis affects cognitive function and is an independent risk factor for the development of cognitive impairment. Both atherosclerosis and cognitive impairment develop over a prolonged period (years), and due to the aging population, markers to identify persons at risk are needed. Carotid artery atherosclerosis can easily be visualized using non-invasive ultrasound, potentially enabling early and intensified risk factor management to preserve cognitive function or delay further decline.

The relation between depression and cognitive impairment is complex. The objective of this article is to review recent literature on cognitive impairment in older adults with depression and provide clinicians an update.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Psych Info for the articles published in the English language related to late-life depression (LLD)/geriatric depression and cognitive impairment. We considered original research articles, relevant systematic reviews, chapters, and important conceptual articles published in the last 9 years (2011-2019). We selected relevant articles for this narrative review.
CONCLUSION: The concept pseudodementia, indicating depression with cognitive impairment mimicking dementia, is now seen only as a historical concept. The current literature strongly agrees with fact that cognitive deficits often exist in LLD. The cognitive deficits in depression were initially seen as trait marker; however, some recent studies suggest that cognitive deficits persist even in the remission phase. There is heterogeneity among the studies in terms of the nature of the cognitive deficits, but higher number of studies reported impairment in attention and executive function. LLD with cognitive deficits is at a higher risk of progression to dementia. In older adults, depression with cognitive impairments requires a comprehensive evaluation. Electroencephalography, event-related potentials, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, amyloid positron emission tomography, and CSF amyloid will supplement clinical evaluation in differentiating functional depressive disorder with cognitive impairment from depression with an underlying degenerative condition.","2021",,"Indian J Psychol Med"," The objective of this article is to review recent literature on cognitive impairment in older adults with depression and provide clinicians an update "," review","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The purpose of this systematic review is to describe neurodegenerative changes on MRI in patients with olfactory impairment and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
METHODS: A literature search encompassing PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies with MRI and olfactory testing among participants diagnosed with MCI or dementia was performed. Sample size, study design, cognitive impairment type, olfactory testing, and MRI findings were abstracted. Two investigators independently reviewed all articles.
RESULTS: The search yielded 556 nonduplicate abstracts, from which 86 articles were reviewed and 24 were included. Seventeen (71%) of 24 studies reported hippocampal volume findings, with 14 studies reporting a relationship between hippocampal volume and olfactory performance. Two (50%) of four prospective studies reported the potential utility of baseline hippocampal volume as a marker of dementia conversion from MCI. Five (21%) of 24 studies reporting olfactory functional MRI (fMRI) findings highlighted the utility of olfactory fMRI to identify individuals in the early stages of cognitive decline.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests hippocampal volume correlates with olfactory performance in individuals with cognitive impairment, and that olfactory fMRI may improve early detection of AD. However, the predictive utility of these imaging markers is limited in prospective studies.

Verbal fluency tasks are widely used to assess executive function in PDD. However, in cases of PD with MCI (PD-MCI), the relative diagnostic accuracy of different qualitative verbal fluency measures and their related neural mechanisms remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relative diagnostic accuracy of qualitative (clustering and switching) verbal fluency strategies and their correlates with functional imaging in PD-MCI.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with PD (26 with MCI and 19 without MCI) and 25 healthy controls underwent comprehensive neurocognitive testing and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. MCI in patients with PD was diagnosed according to established clinical criteria. The diagnostic accuracy of verbal fluency measures was determined via receiver operating characteristic analysis. Changes in brain functional connectivity between groups and across clinical measures were assessed using seed-to-voxel analyses.
RESULTS: Patients with PD-MCI generated fewer words and switched less frequently in semantic and phonemic fluency tasks compared to other groups. Switching in semantic fluency showed high diagnostic accuracy for PD-MCI and was associated with reduced functional connectivity in the salience network.

BioAge1 and BioAge2 predict dementia equally well, as well as lifespan and healthspan. Each one-year increase in BioAge1/2 was associated with 11% elevated risk (HR 1.11; 95%CI 1.08-1.14) of mortality and 7% elevated risk (HR 1.07; 95%CI 1.05-1.09) of first morbidities. We additionally tested the association of microRNAs with age and identified 263 microRNAs significantly associated with biological and chronological age alike. Top differentially expressed microRNAs based on biological age had a higher significance level than those based on chronological age, suggesting that biological age captures aspects of aging signals at the epigenetic level.

However, the influence of study population selection on WMH progression rate has not been studied and the effect of individual patient factors for WMH growth are not fully understood.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on progression of WMHs in longitudinal studies to determine rates of WMH growth, and how these varied according to population characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors. We used these data to calculate necessary sample sizes for clinical trials using WMH as an endpoint.
RESULTS: WMH growth rate was highest in SVD (2.50cc/year), intermediate in unselected stroke patients (1.29cc/year) and lower in patients with non-stroke cardiovascular disease, and with cognitive impairment. Age was significantly associated with progression (correlation coefficient 0.15cc/year, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.28cc/year) as was baseline lesion volume (0.6cc/year, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.06 cc/year). Both hypertension (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.46) and current smoking (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.16) were associated with WMH growth. Sample sizes for a clinical trial varied greatly with patient population selection and baseline lesion volume; estimates are provided.
CONCLUSIONS: WMH progression varies markedly according to the characteristics of the population being studied and this will have a major impact on sample sizes required in a clinical trial. Our sample size estimates provide data for planning clinical trials using WMH as an outcome measure.

OBJECTIVE: Develop a prognostic model using multiple, easily acquired longitudinal measures to predict temporal clinical progression from Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage 1 or 2 to stage 3 in early PD.
METHODS: Predictive longitudinal measures of PD progression were identified by the joint modeling method. Measures were extracted by multivariate functional principal component analysis methods and used as covariates in Cox proportional hazards models. The optimal model was developed from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) data set and confirmed with external validation from the Longitudinal and Biomarker Study in PD (LABS-PD) study.
RESULTS: The proposed prognostic model with longitudinal information of selected clinical measures showed significant advantages in predicting PD temporal progression in comparison to a model with only baseline information (iAUC = 0.812 vs. 0.743). The modeling results allowed the development of a prognostic index for categorizing PD patients into low, mid, and high risk of progression to HY 3 that is offered to facilitate physician-patient discussion on prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating longitudinal information of multiple clinical measures significantly enhances predictive performance of prognostic models. Furthermore, the proposed prognostic index enables clinicians to classify patients into different risk groups, which could be adaptively updated as new longitudinal information becomes available.

BACKGROUND: Immune mechanisms in vascular cognitive aging are incompletely characterized.
DESIGN/METHODS: A subsample of the prospective Northern Manhattan Study underwent detailed neuropsychological testing. Cognitive scores were converted into Z-scores and categorized into four domains (memory, language, processing speed, and executive function) based on factor analysis. Blood samples were analyzed using a 60-plex immunoassay. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) procedures to select markers and their interactions independently associated with cognitive scores. Linear regression models assessed cross-sectional associations of known correlates of cognition with cognitive scores, and assessed model fit before and after addition of LASSO-selected immune markers.
RESULTS: Among 1179 participants (mean age 70 ± 8.9 years, 60% women, 68% Hispanic), inclusion of LASSO-selected immune markers improved model fit above age, education, and other risk factors (p for likelihood ratio test < 0.005 for all domains).

Immune marker effects were comparable to conventional risk factors: for executive function, each standard deviation (SD) increase in CCL11 was associated with an effect equivalent to aging three years; for memory, HGF had twice the effect of aging.

We aimed to validate the clinical utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) for the diagnosis of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome, assess its prognostic value, and establish longitudinal changes in adults with Down syndrome.
METHODS: We did a multicentre cohort study, including adults with Down syndrome (≥18 years), recruited from six hospitals and university medical centres in France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the USA, who had been assessed, followed up, and provided at least two plasma samples. Participants were classified by local clinicians, who were masked to biomarker data, as asymptomatic (ie, no clinical suspicion of Alzheimer's disease), prodromal Alzheimer's disease, or Alzheimer's disease dementia. We classified individuals who progressed along the Alzheimer's disease continuum during follow-up as progressors. Plasma samples were analysed retrospectively; NfL concentrations were measured centrally using commercial kits for biomarker detection. We used ANOVA to evaluate differences in baseline NfL concentrations, Cox regression to study their prognostic value, and linear mixed models to estimate longitudinal changes. To account for potential confounders, we included age, sex, and intellectual disability as covariates in the analyses.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 2, 2010, and July 16, 2019, we analysed 608 samples from 236 people with Down syndrome: 165 (70%) were asymptomatic, 32 (14%) had prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and 29 (12%) had Alzheimer's disease dementia; ten [4%] participants were excluded because their classification was uncertain. Mean follow-up was 3·6 years (SD 1·6, range 0·6-9·2). Baseline plasma NfL concentrations showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0·83 (95% CI 0·76-0·91) in the prodromal group and 0·94 (0·90-0·97) in the dementia group for differentiating from participants who were asymptomatic. An increase of 1 pg/mL in baseline NfL concentrations was associated with a 1·04-fold risk of clinical progression (95% CI 1·01-1·07; p=0·0034). Plasma NfL concentrations showed an annual increase of 3·0% (95% CI 0·4-5·8) per year in the asymptomatic non-progressors group, 11·5% (4·9-18·5) per year in the asymptomatic progressors group, and 16·0% (8·4-24·0) per year in the prodromal Alzheimer's disease progressors group. In participants with Alzheimer's disease dementia, NfL concentrations increased by a mean of 24·3% (15·3-34·1).
INTERPRETATION: Plasma NfL concentrations have excellent diagnostic and prognostic performance for symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. The longitudinal trajectory of plasma NfL supports its use as a theragnostic marker in clinical trials.

Horticultural therapy (HT) has been shown to improve social connectedness and inflammatory markers. However, the underpinning mechanisms of HT remained unknown. Within this study, we hypothesized that improved social connectedness mediates the effects of HT on IL-6 levels.
METHODS: The present study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating the bio-psycho-social effects of HT. Social connectedness was operationalized as positive relationships with others (PRWO), a sub-scale of the Ryff's scale of psychological well-being. IL-6 was quantified using a commercial ELISA kit. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3-month and 6-month post-intervention. Mediation analyses with bootstrapping were run to investigate our primary hypothesis. All analyses were controlled for covariates.
RESULTS: We recruited 59 participants (78% women; 67.10 ± 4.31 years). 29 participants partook in HT and 30 participants were included in the waitlist control group. At baseline, social connectedness was significantly correlated with IL-6 levels (β = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.21 to -0.03, p = 0.008). Furthermore, social connectedness at 3-month significantly mediated the effects of HT on IL-6 levels at 6-month (β = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.54, p = 0.005; β = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.45 to -0.05, p = 0.016).

Therefore, this longitudinal study investigated the role of the '523' variant in cognitive decline in a patient cohort from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. As such, a group of 368 people with PD were assessed annually for cognitive performance using multiple neuropsychological protocols, and were genotyped for the TOMM40 '523' variant using whole-genome sequencing data. Covariate-adjusted generalised linear mixed models were utilised to examine the relationship between TOMM40 '523' allele lengths and cognitive scores, while taking into account the APOE ε genotype. Cognitive scores declined over the 5-year study period and were lower in males than in females. When accounting for APOE ε4, the TOMM40 '523' variant was not robustly associated with overall cognitive performance. However, in APOE ε3/ε3 carriers, who accounted for ~60% of the whole cohort, carriage of shorter '523' alleles was associated with more severe cognitive decline in both sexes, while carriage of the longer alleles in females were associated with better preservation of global cognition and a number of cognitive sub-domains, and with a delay in progression to dementia.

The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) provides the majority of cholinergic innervations to the cerebral cortex. Dysfunction of the cholinergic system and degeneration of the NBM have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative disorders including PD. Several studies have aimed to identify risk factors associated with cognitive decline in order to construct models to predict future cognitive impairment in PD. Given the link between cholinergic dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in PD, a number of studies have focused on the role of the NBM underlying cognitive performance. Recently, microstructural alterations within the NBM, detected using diffusion tensor imaging, have been identified as a strong predictor for the development of cognitive impairment in patients with PD. These microstructural changes in NBM have been shown to precede structural gray matter volumetric loss and may present with an early marker to predict cognitive decline in patients with PD. Longitudinal studies are warranted to provide insights into the potential utility of cholinergic positron emission tomography imaging to predict the development of cognitive impairment in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Provided the urgent need for disease modifying therapies aiming to slow and ultimately halt the progression of cognitive impairment, neuromodulation of NBM, and treatments targeting the cholinergic system may hold a promising potential. In this review, we discuss the link between NBM pathology and clinical symptomatology of cognitive impairment in PD with a focus on the use of in vivo imaging techniques and potential therapeutic interventions.","2021",,"Handb Clin Neurol"," Several studies have aimed to identify risk factors associated with cognitive decline in order to construct models to predict future cognitive impairment in PD "," review","Basal Nucleus of Meynert, FALSE, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity has been proposed as a non-invasive and reproducible method to assess arterial stiffness. However, the association of pulse wave velocity with performance across multiple cognitive domains as well as interactions with in vivo AD biomarkers and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype has received limited study.
METHOD: We studied 193 older adult volunteers (167 with normal cognition and 26 with mild cognitive impairment) who underwent comprehensive medical and neuropsychological evaluation at the University of California, San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were available on 123 participants (63%). Linear models examined whether pulse wave velocity significantly interacted with APOE ε4 status and CSF AD biomarker positivity (based on the ratio of total tau over beta-amyloid [tau/Aβ
RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic characteristics and vascular risk burden, across the entire sample, pulse wave velocity was associated with poorer executive functioning but not the performance in the other cognitive domains. When the modifying effects of AD genetic risk and CSF AD biomarkers were considered, pulse wave velocity interacted with APOE genotype and CSF tau/Aβ ratio such that a stronger association between elevated pulse wave velocity and poorer memory performance was found among those positive for CSF and genetic AD markers. There were no significant interaction effects for non-memory cognitive domains.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that pulse wave velocity, a non-invasive method to assess arterial wall properties, may be a useful marker of risk for cognitive decline, particularly among individuals who are APOE ε4 carriers or CSF AD biomarke0r-positive.","2021",,"Alzheimers Res Ther"," We studied 193 older adult volunteers ( 167 with normal cognition and 26 with mild cognitive impairment ) who underwent comprehensive medical and neuropsychological evaluation at the University of California , San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center ","other","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, Apolipoprotein E4, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Biomarkers, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Peptide Fragments, FALSE, Pulse Wave Analysis, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We aimed to examine subtype-dependent differences in the associations between absolute CVD risk and the incidence of cognitive impairment in a community-dwelling older Japanese cohort.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study comprised 1,641 cognitively intact older Japanese participants without CVDs at baseline. We estimated absolute CVD risk using WHO region-specific risk estimation charts and included age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol at baseline, and the CVD risk level was stratified into the three following risk categories: low (<10%), moderate (10 to <20%), and high (≥20%). Objective cognitive screening was performed using a multicomponent neurocognitive test at baseline and follow-up, and the incidence of cognitive impairment over 48 ± 2 months was determined. The incidence of cognitive impairment in low-, moderate-, and high-CVD risk participants was 1.2, 3.0, and 5.4%, respectively, for amnestic subtypes and 5.8, 10.1, and 14.0%, respectively, for non-amnestic subtypes. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the absolute CVD risk level was significantly associated with non-amnestic impairment but not with amnestic impairment.

The timed up-and-go (TUG) test is the most popular test of walking ability in patients with PD. However, it carries a risk of falls because patients are told to walk as quickly as possible. The purpose of this study was to characterise issues of safety and reproducibility arising in TUG tests.
METHODS: Our population was 7 hospitalised patients (4 men, 3 women) with PD and 1 healthy control. We used video capture, Motion Analyser software, and an innovative Yorisoi (snuggling nursing robot) robot.
RESULTS: We found the same movements when patients walked in time to a verbal rhythm provided by the physiotherapist and when they used the robot in walking. The TUG times were longest when the therapist provided no intervention. The typical PD patient experienced freezing of gait when rounding the reflective cone marker in the TUG test, and after turning, experienced gait festination. The patient thus encountered difficulty in using the reflective marker. Moreover, because of the characteristic PD shuffling gait, the patient's steps were difficult to count automatically. After the turn, the patient's body leaned heavily; however, if the physiotherapist or the robot applied a light force in the direction of the positive axis, it was possible to prevent a fall.
CONCLUSIONS: When applied to patients with PD, the TUG test requires modifications for safety and more accurate step counting to improve reproducibility.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe presence of a sense of security with the attendant or the robot is related to walking speed.The TUG test must be reproducible in patients with PD, regardless of whether there is a rhythm or an attendant, and must be able to count the steps in a shuffling gait.The TUG test must consider safety in patients with PD, because it is easier to fall after a turn and when sitting on a chair, and it is instructed to be in hurry walk.After making a turn, a patient's body may lean heavily; however, if a physiotherapist or a Yorisoi (snuggling nursing robot) robot applies a light force in the direction of the positive axis, it is possible to prevent a fall.Assertive technology, such as the Yorisoi robot, may be used to improve the safety TUG test in patients with PD.","2022",,"Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol"," PURPOSE : Falls are a major problem and cause poor quality of life and reduced life expectancy in people affected by Parkinson's disease ( PD ) ","other","Female, FALSE, Gait, FALSE, Gait Disorders, Neurologic, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, Quality of Life, FALSE, Reproducibility of Results, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

It is dysregulated in various malignancies, although little is known regarding its role in low-grade glioma. The aim of this study is to explore the clinicopathological significance, prognostic value and immune signature of TYROBP expression in low-grade glioma (LGG).
METHODS: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between glioma samples and normal tissues were identified from two GEO microarray datasets using the limma package. The DEGs overlapping across both datasets were functionally annotated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. STRING database was used to establish the protein-protein interaction (PPI) of the DEGs. The PPI network was visualized by Cytoscape and cytoHubba, and the core module and hub genes were identified. The expression profile of TYROBP and patient survival were validated in the Oncomine, GEPIA2 and CGGA databases. The correlation between TYROBP expression and the clinicopathologic characteristics were evaluated. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) were performed by R based on the LGG data from TCGA. The TIMER2.0 database was used to determine the correlation between TYROBP expression and tumor immune infiltrating cells in the LGG patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the prognostic impact of clinicopathological factors via TCGA database.
RESULTS: Sixty-two overlapping DEGs were identified in the 2 datasets, and were mainly enriched in the response to wounding, focal adhesion, GTPase activity and Parkinson disease pathways. TYROBP was identified through the PPI network and cytoHubba. TYROBP expression levels were significantly higher in the LGG tissues compared to the normal tissues, and was associated with worse prognosis and poor clinicopathological parameters. In addition, GSEA showed that TYROBP was positively correlated to neutrophil chemotaxis, macrophage activation, chemokine signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and negatively associated with gamma aminobutyric acid signaling pathway, neurotransmitter transport, neuroactive ligand receptor intersection etc. TIMER2.0 and ssGSEA showed that TYROBP expression was significantly associated with the infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes. The infiltration of the M2 phenotype macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid dendritic cells correlated to worse prognosis in LGG patients. Finally, multivariate analysis showed that elevated TYROBP expression is an independent risk factor for LGG.

Past studies have shown contradictory results of telomere length (TL) in major depression, and are a few studies in late-life depression (LLD). This explores the association between TL as a molecular marker of aging and diagnosis of LLD, the severity of depressive symptoms, and cognitive performance in older adults.
METHODS/DESIGN: We included 78 older adults (45 with LLD and 33 nondepressed controls, according to DSM-V criteria), aged 60-90 years. TL was measured in leukocytes by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction, determining the relative ratio (T/S) between the telomere region copy number (T) and a single copy gene (S), using a relative standard curve.
RESULTS: TL was significantly shorter in the LLD compared with control participants (p = .039). Comparing groups through the severity of depressive symptoms, we found a negative correlation with the severity of depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21, r = -0.325, p = .004) and medical burden (r = -0.271, p = .038). There was no significant correlation between TL and cognitive performance (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, r = 0.152, p = .21).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that older adults with LLD have shorter telomere than healthy controls, especially those with a more severe depressive episode. Our findings suggest that shorter TL can be a marker of the severity of depressive episodes in older adults and indicate that these individuals may be at higher risk of age-associated adverse outcomes linked to depression.","2021",,"Brain Behav"," OBJECTIVES : Telomeres are structures at the extremity of chromosomes that prevents genomic instability , and its shortening seems to be a hallmark of cellular aging ","other","Aged, FALSE, Depression, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Depressive Disorder, Major, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Leukocytes, FALSE, Telomere, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Telomere Shortening, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Non-motor symptoms of PD (e.g., sensory dysfunction, sleep disturbance, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms) precede motor symptoms, appear at all stages, and impact the quality of life, but they frequently go unrecognized and remain untreated. Even when identified, traditional dopamine replacement therapies have little effect. We discuss here the pathology of two PD-associated non-motor symptoms: olfactory dysfunction and depression. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms in PD and predates the onset of motor symptoms. It is accompanied by early deposition of Lewy pathology and neurotransmitter alterations. Because of the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and an increased risk of progression to PD, olfactory testing can potentially be a specific diagnostic marker of PD in the prodromal stage. Depression is a prevalent PD-associated symptom and is often associated with reduced quality of life.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained in the AIDEA study, which enrolled a cohort of ≥75-year-old patients, accessing the ED of 2 hospitals in Florence, Italy.
METHODS: The DSC score and classes (I to IV, corresponding to an increasing risk of death) were obtained from administrative data. Information on health and functional status prior to ED access were collected from face-to-face, direct, or proxy interviews. The 4AT test was administered to screen for possible delirium. Bivariate comparisons of the prevalence of each functional and cognitive marker across 4 DSC classes were performed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the multivariable risk of being in II, III, or IV DSC class vs I.
RESULTS: Among 3358 participants (mean age 83 years, men 44%), 32.9%, 30.3%, 19.5%, and 17.2% were in DSC class I, II, III, and IV. Preadmission abnormal functional and cognitive conditions, and delirium in the ED, were increasingly more common from DSC class I through IV (P < .001).

METHODS: This prospective brain MRI cohort is part of the multicentre Norwegian cognitive impairment after stroke (Nor-COAST) study. Patients hospitalized with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were included from five participating stroke units. Visual rating scales were used to categorize baseline MRIs (N = 410) as vascular, neurodegenerative, mixed, or normal, based on the presence of pathological imaging findings. Pre-stroke cognition was assessed by interviews of patients or caregivers using the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). Stroke severity was assessed with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between imaging markers, PCI, and sex.
RESULTS: Patients' (N = 410) mean (SD) age was 73.6 (±11) years; 182 (44%) participants were female, the mean (SD) NIHSS at admittance was 4.1 (±5). In 68% of the participants, at least one pathological imaging marker was found. Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) was present in 30% of patients, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in 38% of patients and lacunes in 35% of patients. PCI was found in 30% of the patients. PCI was associated with cerebrovascular pathology (OR 2.5; CI = 1.4 to 4.5, p = 0.001) and mixed pathology (OR 3.4; CI = 1.9 to 6.1, p = 0.001) but was not associated with neurodegeneration (OR 1.0; CI = 0.5 to 2.2; p = 0.973). Pathological MRI markers, including MTA and lacunes, were more prevalent among men, as was a history of clinical stroke prior to the index stroke. The OR of PCI for women was not significantly increased (OR 1.2; CI = 0.8 to 1.9; p = 0.3).

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this complication remain unclear. A better understanding of causative processes by which COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment is essential for developing preventive and therapeutic interventions.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted a network-based, multimodal omics comparison of COVID-19 and neurologic complications. We constructed the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome from protein-protein interaction assay and CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic assay results and compared network-based relationships therein with those of known neurological manifestations using network proximity measures. We also investigated the transcriptomic profiles (including single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) marker genes from patients infected with COVID-19, as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the brains of AD patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: We found significant network-based relationships between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation and brain microvascular injury pathways and processes which are implicated in AD. We also detected aberrant expression of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with COVID-19. While transcriptomic analyses showed relatively low expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in human brain, neuroinflammatory changes were pronounced. In addition, single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses showed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors (BSG and FURIN) and antiviral defense genes (LY6E, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFNAR1) was elevated in brain endothelial cells of AD patients and healthy controls relative to neurons and other cell types, suggesting a possible role for brain microvascular injury in COVID-19-mediated cognitive impairment. Overall, individuals with the AD risk allele APOE E4/E4 displayed reduced expression of antiviral defense genes compared to APOE E3/E3 individuals.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest significant mechanistic overlap between AD and COVID-19, centered on neuroinflammation and microvascular injury.

Additionally, when stress persists for a long time, it can trigger serious health problems, particularly depression. Recent studies have revealed that depressed patients have a higher rate of brain aging than healthy subjects and that depression increases dementia risk later in life. However, it remains unknown which factors are involved in brain aging triggered by chronic stress. The most critical change during brain aging is the decline in cognitive function. In addition, cellular senescence is a stable state of cell cycle arrest that occurs because of damage and/or stress and is considered a sign of aging.

However, it remains unclear whether the analysis of routine systemic inflammatory markers could represent a useful prediction tool to identify clinical subtypes in patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's at higher risk of dementia-associated symptoms, such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).
METHODS: We performed a multivariate logistic regression using the 2016 and 2017 National Inpatient Sample with International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes to assess if pro-inflammatory white blood cells (WBCs) anomalies correlate with dementia and BPSD in patients with these disorders.
RESULTS: We found that leukocytosis was the most common WBC inflammatory marker identified in 3.9% of Alzheimer's and 3.3% Parkinson's patients. Leukocytosis was also found to be an independent risk factor for Parkinson's dementia. Multivariate analysis of both cohorts showed that leukocytosis is significantly decreased in patients with BPSD compared to patients without BPSD.

Delirium can be triggered by a single cause, but in most cases, it is multifactorial as it depends on the interaction between predisposing and precipitating factors. Delirium is highly prevalent in older patients across various settings of care and correlates with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Several pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to its onset, including neurotransmitter imbalance, neuroinflammation, altered brain metabolism, and impaired neuronal network connectivity. Several screening and diagnostic tools for delirium exist, but they are unfortunately underutilized. Additionally, the diagnosis of delirium superimposed on dementia poses a formidable challenge - especially if dementia is severe. Non-pharmacological approaches for the prevention and multidomain interventions for the treatment of delirium are recommended, given that there is currently no robust evidence of drugs that can prevent or resolve delirium. This article aims to review the current understanding about delirium in older people. To achieve this goal, we will describe the epidemiology and outcomes of the syndrome, the pathophysiological mechanisms that are supposed to be involved, the most commonly used tools for screening and diagnosis, and prevention strategies and treatments recommended.

The association between baseline TMT and long-term motor outcomes in PD was assessed using Cox regression models for levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing-off, and freezing of gait and a linear mixed model for the longitudinal increases in levodopa-equivalent dose per body weight over time. Statistical analyses were performed separately for sex if an interaction effect between TMT and sex was assumed.
RESULTS: TMT differed substantially between the sexes, and male PD patients had higher TMT (6.69 ± 1.39 mm) than female PD patients (5.64 ± 1.34 mm, p < .001). Cox regression models demonstrated that baseline TMT was not associated with the risk of developing levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing-off, or freezing of gait during the follow-up period.

Here, we describe short case studies addressing general mental well-being (anxiety, stress-reduction) through AI-driven music generation. Engaging in active listening and music-making activities (especially for at risk age groups) can be particularly beneficial, and the practice of music therapy has been shown to be helpful in a range of use cases across a wide age range. However, access to music-making can be prohibitive in terms of access to expertize, materials, and cost. Furthermore the use of existing music for functional outcomes (such as targeted improvement in physical and mental health markers suggested above) can be hindered by issues of repetition and subsequent over-familiarity with existing material. In this paper, we describe machine learning approaches which create functional music informed by biophysiological measurement across two case studies, with target emotional states at opposing ends of a Cartesian affective space (a dimensional emotion space with points ranging from descriptors from relaxation, to fear). Galvanic skin response is used as a marker of psychological arousal and as an estimate of emotional state to be used as a control signal in the training of the machine learning algorithm. This algorithm creates a non-linear time series of musical features for sound synthesis ""on-the-fly"", using a perceptually informed musical feature similarity model. We find an interaction between familiarity and perceived emotional response. We also report on subsequent psychometric evaluation of the generated material, and consider how these - and similar techniques - might be useful for a range of functional music generation tasks, for example, in nonlinear sound-tracking such as that found in interactive media or video games.","2020",,"Front Artif Intell",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: The 2-year Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) included older individuals (60-77 years) at increased risk for dementia but without dementia or substantial cognitive impairment from the general population. Participants were randomized to a multidomain intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk management) or control group (general health advice) in a 1:1 ratio. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. This FINGER exploratory sub-study included 47 participants with measures of 27-OH, cognition, brain MRI, brain FDG-PET, and PiB-PET. Linear regression models were used to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between 27-OH, cognition, and neuroimaging markers, considering several potential confounders/intervention effect modifiers.
RESULTS: 27-OH reduction during the intervention was associated with improvement in cognition (especially memory). This was not observed in the control group. The intervention reduced 27-OH particularly in individuals with the highest 27-OH levels and younger age. No associations were found between changes in 27-OH levels and neuroimaging markers. However, at baseline, a higher 27-OH was associated with lower total gray matter and hippocampal volume, and lower cognitive scores. These associations were unaffected by total cholesterol levels. While sex seemed to influence associations at baseline, it did not affect longitudinal associations.
CONCLUSION: 27-OH appears to be a marker not only for dementia/AD risk, but also for monitoring the effects of preventive interventions on cholesterol metabolism.

,"33667619","Associations between activity fragmentation and subjective memory complaints in middle-aged and older adults.","Del Pozo Cruz B","INTRODUCTION: Subjective memory complaints (SMC) are often considered a clinical marker of mild cognitive impairment and dementia and could manifest as shortening of activity bouts throughout the day causing daily activity to accumulate in a more fragmented pattern. In the current study we explored the association between activity fragmentation and SMC in middle-aged and older adults.
METHODS: We used data from 3820 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2006) with valid accelerometer SMC data. The analyses were conducted in 2020. To calculate activity fragmentation, an active-to-sedentary transition probability was calculated as the number of physical activity bouts (i.e., consecutive minutes registering 100+ counts/min) divided by the total sum of minutes spent in physical activity. A multivariable ordinal logistic regression model was conducted to examine the association between activity fragmentation (scaled) and SMC (yes/no).
RESULTS: Higher activity fragmentation was associated with an increased likelihood of self-reported SMC in the study population (Odd Ratio [95% Confidence Interval] = 1.335 [1.067, 1.669]; Average Marginal Effect [95%CI] = 0.029 [0.006, 0.052]; p-value = 0.021). This association was independent of total physical activity volume.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide support that studying fragmented activity patterns can be useful in identifying those at risk for SMC, over and above total volume of physical activity. Future longitudinal studies are required to establish causality and the temporal order of the observed association. Nevertheless, activity fragmentation in middle-aged and older adults may reflect pre-clinical signs of future neurodegenerative processes indicating potential targets for modification through intervention.","2021",,"Exp Gerontol",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Exercise, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Memory, TRUE, Memory Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nutrition Surveys, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In particular, the fornix has been implicated as especially vulnerable given that it represents the primary outflow tract of the hippocampus. Despite this, little work has focused on the fornix using a potential early marker of white matter degeneration-myelin water fraction (MWF; an in vivo marker of myelin content). Therefore, we sought to (1) clarify associations between MWF in the fornix and memory functioning, and (2) examine whether fornix MWF relates to memory performance above and beyond hippocampal volume and conventional imaging measures of white matter that may not be as specific to alterations in myelin content. Forty nondemented older adults (mean age = 72.9 years) underwent an MRI exam and neuropsychological assessment. Multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) was used to quantify fornix MWF and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to measure fornix fractional anisotropy (FA). Adjusting for age, sex, education, and vascular risk factors, linear regression models revealed that, lower fornix MWF was significantly associated with poorer memory functioning (β = 0.405, p = .007) across our sample of older adults. Notably, fornix MWF remained a significant predictor of memory functioning (β = 0.380, p = .015) even after adjusting for fornix DTI FA and hippocampal volume (in addition to the above covariates).

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether subjective age is associated with subsequent cognition and dementia risk in middle-aged and older adults. Samples were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Participants reported their subjective ages at the baseline (2004/2005), and their cognitive functions were measured after 10 years (2014/2015). Newly diagnosed dementias were recorded between 2006/2007 to 2014/2015. Overall, 6,475 adults aged 50 years or older were included in the current analyses. The relationship between subjective age reported at baseline and cognition assessed ten years later was modeled using multiple linear regression models. Compared to participants who reported a younger subjective age, those who reported an older subjective age were more likely to have poorer cognition after ten years (β = -0.705, P = .002 for memory, β = -1.567, P = .001 for executive function). A Cox proportional hazard regression model suggested that older subjective age was an independent risk factor for incident dementia (HR = 1.737, 95% CI =1.060-2.848).

Ambroxol is one of the most effective pharmacological chaperones of GCase. Fourteen GD patients, six PD patients with mutations in the GBA gene (GBA-PD), and thirty controls were enrolled. GCase activity and hexosylsphingosine (HexSph) concentration were measured in dried blood and macrophage spots using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The effect of ambroxol on GCase translocation to lysosomes was assessed using confocal microscopy. The results showed that ambroxol treatment significantly increased GCase activity in cultured macrophages derived from patient blood monocytic cell (PBMC) of GD (by 3.3-fold) and GBA-PD patients (by 3.5-fold) compared to untreated cells (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) four days after cultivation.

PD has been associated with various metabolic factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and more recently chronic kidney disease where proteinuria has been associated with an increased risk. The presence of small amounts of albumin in urine, microalbuminuria, is a common biomarker for endothelial damage and a predictive factor for not only cardiovascular but also neurological dysfunction. Multiple studies have assessed potential biomarkers for PD progression with great heterogeneity, we hypothesize the use of microalbuminuria as a potential marker that correlates with PD severity and might represent a feasible and simple method of evaluating PD patients in clinical practice. Evidence supporting the present hypothesis comes from oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction. Oxidative stress is a key element in PD pathogenesis; studies have shown lower antioxidant capacity as PD progresses. On the other side, insulin signaling plays an important role in neuronal growth and survival, with its resistance being associated with PD. Microalbuminuria has been associated with both processes; increased levels of oxidative stress markers and decreased insulin sensitivity, hence its screening in PD might reflect these common pathological mechanisms. Moreover, the low vitamin D levels observed in PD patients, which are correlated with endothelial dysfunction and disease severity, might contribute to microalbuminuria induction. More evidence on this vascular approach comes from white matter lesions (WML), observed in brain imaging, which have been significantly associated with motor and non-motor function in PD patients and are independently associated with microalbuminuria. In this manner, an oxidant and insulin resistant environment, along with low vitamin D levels in PD patients, which are associated with microalbuminuria, might contribute altogether to WML. As the latter are correlated with motor and non-motor function, microalbuminuria might thus give insight on PD status. Prospective cohort studies with an adequate sample size, follow-up, and a thorough battery of clinical tests for PD are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","2021",,"Med Hypotheses",,"other","Biomarkers, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Quality of Life, FALSE, Severity of Illness Index, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) analysis of CSF has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of misfolded α-synuclein in patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. We investigated whether RT-QuIC could detect α-synuclein in the CSF of patients with IRBD and be used as a biomarker of prodromal α-synucleinopathy.
METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture from patients with video polysomnography-confirmed IRBD recruited at a specialised sleep disorders centre in Barcelona, Spain, and from controls free of neurological disease. CSF samples were stored until analysed using RT-QuIC. After lumbar puncture, participants were assessed clinically for neurological status every 3-12 months. Rates of neurological disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Disease-free survival rates were assessed from the date of lumbar puncture to the date of diagnosis of any neurodegenerative disease, or to the last follow-up visit for censored observations.
FINDINGS: 52 patients with IRBD and 40 healthy controls matched for age (p=0·20), sex (p=0·15), and duration of follow-up (p=0·27) underwent lumbar puncture between March 23, 2008, and July 16, 2017. The CSF α-synuclein RT-QuIC assay was positive in 47 (90%) patients with IRBD and in four (10%) controls, resulting in a sensitivity of 90·4% (95% CI 79·4-95·8) and a specificity of 90·0% (95% CI 76·9-96·0). Mean follow-up from lumbar puncture until the end of the study (July 31, 2020) was 7·1 years (SD 2·8) in patients with IRBD and 7·7 years (2·9) in controls. During follow-up, 32 (62%) patients were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies a mean 3·4 years (SD 2·6) after lumbar puncture, of whom 31 (97%) were α-synuclein positive at baseline. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with IRBD who were α-synuclein negative had lower risk for developing Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years of follow-up than patients with IRBD who were α-synuclein positive (log-rank test p=0·028; hazard ratio 0·143, 95% CI 0·019-1·063). During follow-up, none of the controls developed an α-synucleinopathy. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that participants who were α-synuclein negative (ie, five patients with IRBD plus 36 controls) had lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years after lumbar puncture than participants who were α-synuclein positive (ie, 47 patients with IRBD plus four controls; log-rank test p<0·0001; hazard ratio 0·024, 95% CI 0·003-0·177).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with IRBD, RT-QuIC detects misfolded α-synuclein in the CSF with both sensitivity and specificity of 90%, and α-synuclein positivity was associated with increased risk of subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. Detection of α-synuclein in the CSF represents a potential prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. If these findings are replicated in additional cohorts, detection of CSF α-synuclein by RT-QuIC could be used to enrich IRBD cohorts in neuroprotective trials, particularly when assessing interventions that target α-synuclein.

There is an urgent need for simple, non-invasive testing of MCI by blood biomarkers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the association of red blood cell (RBC) indices with MCI, and select the best hematologic characteristic for detection of MCI in elderly Chinese.
METHODS: Matched case-control study was carried out with 85 pairs of MCI subjects and healthy controls. The matching criteria was age, gender and education attainment. All samples were analyzed for RBC indices, including hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD). A conditional logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between RBC indices and MCI. The diagnostic efficacy of the biomarkers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC).
RESULTS: Among all RBC indices, there were significant differences in HGB (124.82 ± 7.89 vs. 133.93 ± 4.52, P < 0.001) and RDW-SD (45.29 ± 2.03 vs. 41.34 ± 4.41, P < 0.001) between two groups. In the logistic regression model, after adjustment for lifestyle factors and comorbidities, significant statistically associations have been found between higher HGB and lower risk of MCI (adjusted OR: 0.831; 95% CI: 0.773-0.893), higher RDW-SD and a higher risk of MCI (adjusted OR: 1.575; 95% CI: 1.326- 1.872). ROC analysis suggested that the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found with the combination of HGB and RDW-SD (AUC = 0.842), followed by HGB(AUC = 0.795), and finally by modest RDW-SD (AUC = 0.777). Combination of HGB <131 g/L and RDW-SD >43.4 fL yielded a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 89%, overall diagnosis efficiency of which were better than HBG and RDW-SD alone.
CONCLUSION: Lower HGB and higher RDW-SD alone were significantly found to be associated with increased risk of MCI, and offered modest sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic marker. The combination of HGB and RDW-SD was more sensitive and had higher classification accuracy for differentiating MCI from healthy controls.

However, its involvement in vascular dementia (VaD) and pre-dementia stages, namely cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), both of which fall under the spectrum of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), has yet to be examined. Its correlations with inflammatory cytokines in cognitive impairment also await investigation. 80 subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), 160 with CIND and 144 with dementia were included in a cross-sectional study on a Singapore-based memory clinic cohort. All subjects underwent comprehensive clinical, neuropsychological and brain neuroimaging assessments, together with clinical diagnoses based on established criteria. Blood samples were collected and OPN as well as inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were measured using immunoassays. Multivariate regression analyses showed significant associations between increased OPN and VCI groups, namely CIND with CeVD, AD with CeVD and VaD. Interestingly, higher OPN was also significantly associated with AD even in the absence of CeVD. We further showed that increased OPN significantly associated with neuroimaging markers of CeVD and neurodegeneration, including cortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities and brain atrophy. OPN also correlated with elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. Our findings suggest that OPN may play a role in both VCI and neurodegenerative dementias.

The result is the reduced resilience in the presence of diseases and medications. These changes are more evident in older persons with neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive-motoric frailty.
RECENT FINDINGS: A relationship between liver alteration, gut microbiota and the presence of viruses and gram-bacteria is conceivable. They determine the acceleration of neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive and motoric frailty. Hospitalization represents one of the stressors for the gut microbiota, producing dysbiosis and increasing the representation of pathobionts. The gut microbiota alterations during hospitalization may be associated with negative clinical outcomes. This phenomenon together with liver dysfunction could produce an acceleration of the trajectory of cognitive-motoric frailty towards disability and mortality. The observation that predisability is associated of both losses of cognition and motoric performance, has allowed introducing a new syndrome, the motoric-cognitive risk syndrome, which is a condition of increased risk of dementia and mobility-disability.

While a number of genes and variants have been identified in recent decades as causative or protective agents of this condition, a limited number of studies have been conducted in mixed populations, such as Mexican Mestizos. The historical convergence of two founding groups and three ethnicities, and the increasing north-to-south gradient of Native American ancestry in Mexico resulted in a subpopulation structure with considerable genetic diversity. In this work, we investigate the influence of 21 known susceptibility variants for PD. Our case-control study, with a cohort of 311 Mexican Mestizo subjects, found a significant risk association for the variant rs1491942 in LRRK2. However, when stratification by ancestry was performed, a risk effect for MTHFR rs1801133 was observed only in the group with the highest percentage of European ancestry, and the PD risk effect for LRRK2 rs1491942 was significant in subjects with a higher ratio of Native American ancestry. Meta-analyses of these SNP revealed the effect of LRRK2 rs1491942 to be even more significant than previously described in populations of European descent. Although corroboration is necessary, our findings suggest that polymorphism rs1491942 may be useful as a risk marker of PD in Mexican Mestizos with greater Native American ancestry. The absence of associations with the remaining known risk factors is, in itself, a relevant finding and invites further research into the shared risk factors' role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disorder.","2021",,"NPJ Parkinsons Dis",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: 36 PD were matched to 36 Healthy Controls (HC). The α/θ in eight hemispheric regions was computed from the relative power spectral density of the resting-state quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG). Correlations between α/θ and performance in several neuropsychological tests were conducted, significant findings were included in a moderation analysis.
RESULTS: The α/θ in all regions was lower in PD than in HC, with larger effect sizes in the posterior regions. Right parietal, and right and left occipital α/θ had significant positive correlations with performance in Judgement of Line Orientation Test (JLOT) in PD. Adjusted moderation analysis indicated that right, but not left, occipital α/θ influenced the JLOT performance related to PD.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of the occipital α/θ, in particular on the right side, was associated with visuospatial performance impairment in PD.
SIGNIFICANCE: Visuospatial impairment in PD, which is highly correlated with the subsequent development of dementia, is reflected in α/θ in the right posterior regions. The right occipital α/θ may represent a useful qEEG marker for evaluating the presence of early signs of cognitive decline in PD and the subsequent risk of dementia.","2021",,"Clin Neurophysiol"," OBJECTIVE : To determine possible associations of hemispheric-regional alpha / theta ratio ( α / θ ) with neuropsychological test performance in Parkinson's Disease ( PD ) non-demented patients ","other","Aged, FALSE, Alpha Rhythm, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Electroencephalography, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, TRUE, Occipital Lobe, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Rest, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Theta Rhythm, FALSE, physiology, Q000502",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We hypothesized that cognitive impairment and functional limitations influence how punding behaviors manifest in PD.
METHODS: We extracted data on punding, hobbyism, and cognition from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). Punding and hobbyism were measured with the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP) scale. We determined how cognition predicted punding and hobbyism behaviors-adjusting for levodopa dose, Hoehn & Yahr stage, disease duration, and age-using generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression. Activities of daily living (ADL) and motor impairment were measured with the MDS-UPDRS scale.
RESULTS: In GEE logistic regression models, punding was selectively associated with lower scores on the Letter Number Sequencing test (LNS), the primary attention test in PPMI (Odds ratio: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79-0.96); p = 0.022). This was corroborated by a subscale-analysis of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, as only the attention subscale was significantly associated with punding (OR: 0.59 (0.45-0.77); p < 0.001). Baseline impairment in LNS (Hazard ratio: 2.52 (1.22-5.20); p = 0.012) and MoCA attention (HR: 2.68 (1.32-5.42); p = 0.006) predicted earlier punding in Cox regression. In turn, ADL dysfunction predicted punding (OR: 1.55 (1.20-2.00); p < 0.001), but not hobbyism.

Rigorously validated biomarkers have consistently been identified as crucial for multicenter studies to identify effective strategies to prevent and treat VCID, specifically to detect increased VCID risk, diagnose the presence of small vessel disease and its subtypes, assess prognosis for disease progression or response to treatment, demonstrate target engagement or mechanism of action for candidate interventions, and monitor disease progression during treatment. The seven project sites and central coordinating center comprising MarkVCID, working with NINDS and NIA, identified a panel of 11 candidate fluid- and neuroimaging-based biomarker kits and established harmonized multicenter study protocols (see companion paper ""MarkVCID cerebral small vessel consortium: I. Enrollment, clinical, fluid protocols"" for full details). Here we describe the MarkVCID neuroimaging protocols with specific focus on validating their application to future multicenter trials. MarkVCID procedures for participant enrollment; clinical and cognitive evaluation; and collection, handling, and instrumental validation of fluid samples are described in detail in a companion paper. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long served as the neuroimaging modality of choice for cerebral small vessel disease and VCID because of its sensitivity to a wide range of brain properties, including small structural lesions, connectivity, and cerebrovascular physiology. Despite MRI's widespread use in the VCID field, there have been relatively scant data validating the repeatability and reproducibility of MRI-based biomarkers across raters, scanner types, and time intervals (collectively defined as instrumental validity). The MRI protocols described here address the core MRI sequences for assessing cerebral small vessel disease in future research studies, specific sequence parameters for use across various research scanner types, and rigorous procedures for determining instrumental validity. Another candidate neuroimaging modality considered by MarkVCID is optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a non-invasive technique for directly visualizing retinal capillaries as a marker of the cerebral capillaries. OCTA has theoretical promise as a unique opportunity to visualize small vessels derived from the cerebral circulation, but at a considerably earlier stage of development than MRI. The additional OCTA protocols described here address procedures for determining OCTA instrumental validity, evaluating sources of variability such as pupil dilation, and handling data to maintain participant privacy. MRI protocol and instrumental validation The core sequences selected for the MarkVCID MRI protocol are three-dimensional T1-weighted multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition-of-gradient-echo (ME-MPRAGE), three-dimensional T2-weighted fast spin echo fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery (FLAIR), two-dimensional diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging (DWI), three-dimensional T2*-weighted multi-echo gradient echo (3D-GRE), three-dimensional T","2021",,"Alzheimers Dement",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Angiography, FALSE, Biomarkers, TRUE, Brain, FALSE, Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neuroimaging, FALSE, standards, Q000592, Tomography, Optical Coherence, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In the present report, α-synucleinopathy (α-synuclein), neurodegeneration (Neu-N), astrogliosis (GFAP), and microgliosis (Iba-1) were quantified, using specific markers and stereological methods. Disease, sex, age, disease duration, and post-mortem interval were considered variables for statistical analysis. No volumetric changes have been identified regarding disease or sex. α-Synucleinopathy was present throughout the OB, mainly concentrated on anterior olfactory nucleus. Neurodegeneration (reduction in Neu-N-positive cells) was statistically significant in the diseased group. Astrogliosis (increased GFAP labeling) and microgliosis (increased Iba-1 labeling) were significantly enhanced in the Parkinson's disease group. When analyzed per sex, neurodegeneration and microgliosis differences are only present in men.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects at risk were selected for the presence of characteristic premotor symptoms, including impairments of sleep, olfaction and constipation.The risk group included 12 people, the control group - 8 people.
RESULTS: Among seven catecholamines and their metabolites detected in the blood, only the concentration of L-dioxiphenylalanine (L-DOPA) changed (decreased) in subjects at risk compared with the control. A decrease in the concentration of L-DOPA is considered as a manifestation (marker) of selective degeneration of central and peripheral catecholaminergic neurons in PD. In contrast to L-DOPA, the concentration of seven of the twelve detected sphingomyelins in the blood of the subjects at risk increased. Given that a change in the metabolism of sphingomyelins is associated with processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, and synucleinopathy, an increase in their concentration in the blood of patients at risk is considered as a manifestation of systemic general degeneration of central and peripheral neurons. Finally, in the blood of subjects at risk, we found a trend towards a decrease in the concentration of urates, which are endogenous neuroprotectors.

We also describe some emerging neuroimaging techniques such as arterial spin labeling, diffusion tensor imaging, and quantitative susceptibility mapping. Recent literature suggests that structural imaging may be the most sensitive and cost-effective marker to detect cognitive decline, while molecular positron emission tomography is primarily useful for detecting disease specific pathology later in the disease process.

Due to heterogeneity in the functioning in persons with DS, it is difficult to use cognitive testing to assess whether a person with DS has developed dementia due to AD. Electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity has shown promising results as a diagnostic tool for AD in persons without DS. In the current exploratory study, we investigated whether EEG functional connectivity could be used as a diagnostic marker of AD in persons with DS and the association with symptoms.
METHODS: Electroencephalography from 12 persons with DS and 16 persons with DS-AD were analysed, and both coherence and weighted phase lag index were calculated. In addition, we calculated the average coherence for fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal connections. Lastly, we investigated the correlation between the informant-based Dementia Screening Questionnaire in Intellectual Disability (DSQIID) and total alpha coherence.
RESULTS: Decreased alpha and increased delta coherence and weighted phase lag index were observed in DS-AD as compared with DS. The decrease in alpha coherence was more marked in the fronto-parietal connections as compared with the temporo-parietal connections. No significant correlation was found between DSQIID and total alpha coherence (P value = 0.095, rho = -0.335).
CONCLUSION: The decreased alpha coherence and weighted phase lag index have previously been found in AD. The increased delta coherence and weighted phase lag index may indicate a different initial neurophysiological presentation as compared with patients with AD or may be a sign of more advanced disease.

Despite this, our understanding of LOE as a cerebrovascular phenomenon is in its infancy. LOE also appears to be a harbinger of dementia.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify publications relating to LOE and identified observational studies, clinical studies, and radiological studies.
RESULTS: A meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated that patients presenting with LOE experience an increased risk of subsequent stroke (weighted OR 3.88 (95% CI 2.76-5.46)). The additional studies demonstrated clinical and radiological evidence to support the premise that LOE is likely to reflect underlying cerebrovascular disease.
SIGNIFICANCE: Cerebrovascular disease risk factors convey increased risk of LOE and LOE can precede stroke and dementia, acting as an early marker for cerebrovascular risk. This may represent a potential point for intervention. There are a number of suggested mechanisms relating LOE to stroke; however, there is limited understanding of the natural history of LOE.

They could serve as a key population for disease-modifying trials. Abnormal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is a strong candidate biomarker for risk of aSN diagnosis in iRBD. Our primary objective was to identify a quantitative measure of DAT imaging that predicts diagnosis of clinically-defined aSN in iRBD.
METHODS: The sample included individuals with iRBD, early Parkinson's Disease (PD), and healthy controls (HC) enrolled in the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative, a longitudinal, observational, international, multicenter study. The iRBD cohort was enriched with individuals with abnormal DAT binding at baseline. Motor and nonmotor measures were compared across groups. DAT specific binding ratios (SBR) were used to calculate the percent of expected DAT binding for age and sex using normative data from HCs. Receiver operative characteristic analyses identified a baseline DAT binding cutoff that distinguishes iRBD participants diagnosed with an aSN in follow-up versus those not diagnosed.
RESULTS: The sample included 38 with iRBD, 205 with PD, and 92 HC who underwent DAT-SPECT at baseline. Over 4.7 years of mean follow-up, 14 (36.84%) with iRBD were clinically diagnosed with aSN.

Here, we aimed to identify a Parkinson's disease-related gene involved in colon cancer, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and test whether it can be used as a target for cancer therapy.
METHODS: We first screened colon cancer and normal tissues for differential expression of Parkinson's disease-associated genes and identified ATP13A2, which encodes cation-transporting ATPase 13A2, as a putative marker for colon cancer. We next correlated ATP13A2 expression with colon cancer prognosis. We performed a series of ATP13A2 knockdown and overexpression studies in vitro to identify the contribution of ATP13A2 in the stemness and invasive capacity of colon cancer cells. Additionally, autophagy flux assay were determined to explore the mechanism of ATP13A2 induced stemness. Finally, we knocked down ATP13A2 in mice using siRNA to determine whether it can be used as target for colon cancer treatment.
RESULTS: Colon cancer patients with high ATP13A2 expression exhibit shorter overall survival than those with low ATP13A2. Functionally, ATP13A2 acts as a novel stimulator of stem-like traits. Furthermore, knockdown of ATP13A2 in HCT116 resulted in decreased levels of cellular autophagy. Additionally, bafilomycin A1, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed the ATP13A2-induced stemness of colon cancer cells. Lastly treatment with ATP13A2 siRNA reduced the volume of colon cancer xenografts in mice.

This study demonstrates the capacity of intermittent infusions of calcium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to reduce the amount of lead measured by provocative urinary testing, which is considered a marker for total body lead stores. Since lead is a known toxic substance with no safe levels, reducing the amount of accumulated lead in an individual has the possibility of decreasing the risk of heart disease, dementia, and other chronic illnesses associated with lead exposure. This study population was 15 healthy, asymptomatic patients who were evaluated for accumulated total body lead stores as part of a routine health screening. Total body lead was estimated by measuring urinary output after the patients had received intravenous (IV) calcium EDTA as a chelating agent. After establishing their baseline stored lead levels, patients received a series of intravenous chelation infusions to reduce body lead.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is also associated with synucleinopathies and considered as a powerful predictor of PD. Growing evidence suggests the diminished clearance of α-synuclein may be partly attributable to poor interstitial fluid drainage, which can be reflected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible enlarged perivascular space (EPVS). However, the effect of MRI-visible EPVS on iRBD and PD, and their correlation with clinical characteristics remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and neuroimaging significance of MRI-visible EPVS in iRBD and PD patients.
METHODS: We enrolled 33 iRBD patients, 82 PD (with and without RBD) patients, and 35 healthy controls (HCs), who underwent clinical evaluation and 3.0 Tesla MRI. Two neurologists assessed MRI-visible EPVS in centrum semiovale (CSO), basal ganglia (BG), substantia nigra (SN), and brainstem (BS). Independent risk factors for iRBD and PD were investigated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Spearman analysis was used to test the correlation of MRI-visible EPVS with clinical characteristics of patients.
RESULTS: iRBD patients had significantly higher EPVS burdens (CSO, BG, SN, and BS) than PD patients. Higher CSO-EPVS and BS-EPVS burdens were independent risk factors for iRBD. Furthermore, higher CSO-EPVS and SN-EPVS burdens were positively correlated with the severity of clinical symptom in iRBD patients, and higher BG-EPVS burden was positively correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in PD patients.
CONCLUSION: iRBD and PD patients have different MRI-visible EPVS burdens, which may be related with a compensatory mechanism in glymphatic system. Lower MRI-visible EPVS burden in PD patients may be a manifestation of severe brain waste drainage dysfunction.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the serum levels of GDNF and its precursors and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, and to assess their potential as a diagnostic marker. Fifty-three primary outpatients and hospitalized patients with Parkinson's disease (23 men and 30 women) with an average age of 66.58 years were enrolled from the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University of China in this case-control study. The patients were divided into the Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment group (n = 27) and the Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function group (n = 26) based on their Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. In addition, 26 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were included as the healthy control group. Results demonstrated that serum GDNF levels were significantly higher in the Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function group than in the other two groups. There were no significant differences in GDNF precursor levels among the three groups. Correlation analysis revealed that serum GDNF levels, GDNF/α-pro-GDNF ratios, and GDNF/β-pro-GDNF ratios were moderately or highly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. To explore the risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease, logistic regression analysis and stepwise linear regression analysis were performed. Both GDNF levels and Hoehn-Yahr stage were risk factors for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, and were the common influencing factors for cognitive scale scores. Neither α-pro-GDNF nor β-pro-GDNF was risk factors for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. A receiver operating characteristic curve of GDNF was generated to predict cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (area under the curve = 0.859). This result indicates that the possibility that serum GDNF can correctly distinguish whether patients with Parkinson's disease have cognitive impairment is 0.859. Together, these results suggest that serum GDNF may be an effective diagnostic marker for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. However, α-pro-GDNF and β-pro-GDNF are not useful for predicting cognitive impairment in this disease.

Although most patients benefit with minimal cognitive side effects, cognitive decline is a risk, and there is little available evidence to guide preoperative risk assessment. Visual illusions or visual hallucinations (VHs) and impulse-control behaviors (ICBs) are relatively common complications of PD and its treatment and may be a marker of more advanced disease, but their relationship with postoperative cognition has not been established. The authors aimed to determine whether any preoperative history of VHs or ICBs is associated with cognitive change after DBS.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review identified 54 patients with PD who received DBS of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus and who completed both pre- and postoperative neuropsychological testing. Linear regression models were used to assess whether any preoperative history of VHs or ICBs was associated with changes in attention, executive function, language, memory, or visuospatial cognitive domains while controlling for surgical target and duration between evaluations.
RESULTS: The investigators found that a history of VHs was associated with declines in attention (b=-4.04, p=0.041) and executive function (b=-4.24, p=0.021). A history of ICBs was not associated with any significant changes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a history of VHs may increase risk of cognitive decline after DBS; thus, specific preoperative counseling and targeted remediation strategies for these patients may be indicated.

MCI is a heterogenous clinical syndrome reflecting a change in cognitive function and deficits on neuropsychological testing but relatively intact activities of daily living. MCI is a risk state for further cognitive and functional decline with 5-15% of people developing dementia per year. However, ~50% remain stable at 5 years and in a minority, symptoms resolve over time. There is considerable debate about whether MCI is a useful clinical diagnosis, or whether the use of the term prevents proper inquiry (by history, examination and investigations) into underlying causes of cognitive symptoms, which can include prodromal neurodegenerative disease, other physical or psychiatric illness, or combinations thereof. Cognitive testing, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers can improve the sensitivity and specificity of aetiological diagnosis, with growing evidence that these may also help guide prognosis. Diagnostic criteria allow for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to be made where MCI is accompanied by appropriate biomarker changes, but in practice, such biomarkers are not available in routine clinical practice in the UK. This would change if disease-modifying therapies became available and required a definitive diagnosis but would present major challenges to the National Health Service and similar health systems. Significantly increased investment would be required in training, infrastructure and provision of fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging. Statistical techniques combining markers may provide greater sensitivity and specificity than any single disease marker but their practical usefulness will depend on large-scale studies to ensure ecological validity and that multiple measures, e.g. both cognitive tests and biomarkers, are widely available for clinical use.

Among those NCI at baseline (n=9773), each 0.1 increment increase in the frailty index was associated with a higher risk of developing MCI and a higher risk of progressing to dementia. Among those with MCI at baseline (n=4717), higher frailty was associated with a higher risk of progressing to dementia, a lower probability of being reclassified as NCI, and a higher likelihood of returning to MCI in those that were reclassified as NCI.

Dispersion, or within-person performance variability across cognitive tests, is a potential marker of cognitive decline. This study examined group differences in dispersion between LLMD and nondepressed healthy controls (HC) and investigated whether dispersion was a predictor of cognitive performance 1 year later in LLMD. We also explored demographic, clinical, and structural imaging correlates of dispersion in LLMD and HC. We hypothesized that dispersion would be greater in LLMD compared with HC and would be associated with worse cognitive performance 1 year later in LLMD.
DESIGN: Participants were enrolled in the Neurobiology of Late-Life Depression, a naturalistic longitudinal investigation of the predictors of poor illness course in LLMD.
PARTICIPANTS: The baseline sample consisted of 121 older adults with LLMD and 39 HC; of these subjects, 94 LLMD and 35 HC underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One-year cognitive data were available for 107 LLMD patients.
MEASUREMENTS: All participants underwent detailed clinical and structural MRI at baseline. LLMD participants also completed a comprehensive cognitive evaluation 1 year later.
RESULTS: Higher test dispersion was evident in LLMD when compared with nondepressed controls. Greater baseline dispersion predicted 1-year cognitive decline in LLMD patients even when controlling for baseline cognitive functioning and demographic and clinical confounders. Dispersion was correlated with white matter lesions in LLMD but not HC. Dispersion was also correlated with anxiety in both LLMD and HC.

Cognitive function can be partially restored after quitting smoking, but still lower than never smoked group. The underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. The effects of smoking cessation combined with cerebral chronic hypoperfusion (CCH) on cognitive function have never been described. Here, we established a cigarette smoking cessation model, a CCH model, and a cigarette smoking cessation plus CCH model. We investigated cognitive function in these models and the mechanisms of the neuroinflammation, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3(NLRP3)/cysteine aspartate-specific proteinase (caspase-1)/interleukin- 1β (IL-1β) pathway, and eucaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) /autophagy pathway. We used morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) test to evaluate cognitive function in rats. Nissl staining was performed to observe cell morphology in the hippocampal CA1 area. A neuroinflammatory marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) was assessed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry staining. IL-1β levels were detected by ELISA. The protein levels of NLRP3/caspase-1/ IL-1β and eIF2α/autophagy pathway were evaluated by Western blot analysis. LC3 was assessed by immunofluorescence staining. CCH can affect cognitive function by influencing neuroinflammation, NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway, and eIF2α/autophagy pathway. Past exposure to cigarette smoke can also affect cognitive function by influencing neuroinflammation and NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β pathway, which may be induced by smoking and may not be alleviated after smoking cessation. Past exposure to cigarette smoke does not influence autophagy, which may be increased by smoking and then decrease to normal levels after smoking cessation.

Here we explored the association of serum-NfL with imaging and cognitive measures in SVD longitudinally.
METHODS: From 503 subjects with SVD, baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was available for 264 participants (follow-up 8.7±0.2 years). Baseline serum-NfL was measured by an ultrasensitive single-molecule-assay. SVD-MRI-markers including white matter hyperintensity (WMH)-volume, mean diffusivity (MD), lacunes, and microbleeds were assessed at both timepoints. Cognitive testing was performed in 336 participants, including SVD-related domains as well as global cognition and memory. Associations with NfL were assessed using linear regression analyses and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
RESULTS: Serum-NfL was associated with baseline WMH-volume, MD-values and presence of lacunes and microbleeds. SVD-related MRI- and cognitive measures showed progression during follow-up. NfL-levels were associated with future MRI-markers of SVD, including WMH, MD and lacunes. For the latter, this association was independent of baseline lacunes. Furthermore, NfL was associated with incident lacunes during follow-up (P=0.040).

Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) describes self-perceived worsening of cognition despite unimpaired performance on neuropsychological tests. SCD has been associated with an increased dementia risk and steeper memory decline. Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a transdiagnostic process that manifests across several mental health disorders associated with increased vulnerability to dementia. RNT has thus been proposed as a candidate marker of risk for dementia and, relatedly, could contribute to the manifestation of SCD. We aimed to investigate the relationship between SCD and RNT alongside other proposed psychological risk/protective factors for dementia and cognitive decline.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional online survey, 491 older adults (mean = 64.9 years, SD = 4.2; 63.1% female) completed measures of RNT, personality traits, purpose in life, worry, rumination, and meditation practice. SCD was assessed continuously via self-perceived cognitive function (Neuro-QoL) and categorically via endorsement (yes/no) of memory complaints. Regression models, using a stepwise backwards elimination, were built to assess associations between SCD, demographics, and all risk/protective factors.
RESULTS: A total of 24.2% of participants reported memory complaints. In the final prediction models, RNT was the only psychological variable associated with lower self-perceived cognitive function and with a higher likelihood of memory complaints.
CONCLUSIONS: This study empirically corroborates the theoretical relationship between SCD and RNT.

However, the predictive value of minor psychotic phenomena in cognitive deterioration is not well known. Cross-sectional studies have shown that PD patients with minor hallucinations have more severe cortical atrophy than non-hallucinators, but baseline and longitudinal studies addressing the evolution of these brain differences are lacking. The impact of developing minor hallucinations on cognitive impairment and cortical atrophy progression in early PD was explored.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-one de novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative for whom brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were available were included. Cognitive outcome at 5 years was compared between patients with and without minor hallucinations during follow-up. Additionally, using gray matter volume (GMV) voxel-based morphometry, cross-sectional (at baseline) and longitudinal (1- and 2-year GMV loss) structural brain differences between groups were studied.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 35.1% of patients developed minor hallucinations. At 5 years, these patients showed an increased prevalence of subjective cognitive decline compared to non-hallucinators (44.1% vs. 13.9%; p < 0.001), but not formal cognitive impairment. Additionally, compared to non-hallucinators, they exhibited reduced GMV at baseline in visuoperceptive areas and increased GMV loss in left temporal areas (p < 0.05 corrected).

,"33029617","Mitochondrial damage-associated inflammation highlights biomarkers in PRKN/PINK1 parkinsonism.","Borsche M","There is increasing evidence for a role of inflammation in Parkinson's disease. Recent research in murine models suggests that parkin and PINK1 deficiency leads to impaired mitophagy, which causes the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), thereby triggering inflammation. Specifically, the CGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)-STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway mitigates activation of the innate immune system, quantifiable as increased interleukin-6 (IL6) levels. However, the role of IL6 and circulating cell-free mtDNA in unaffected and affected individuals harbouring mutations in PRKN/PINK1 and idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients remain elusive. We investigated IL6, C-reactive protein, and circulating cell-free mtDNA in serum of 245 participants in two cohorts from tertiary movement disorder centres. We performed a hypothesis-driven rank-based statistical approach adjusting for multiple testing. We detected (i) elevated IL6 levels in patients with biallelic PRKN/PINK1 mutations compared to healthy control subjects in a German cohort, supporting the concept of a role for inflammation in PRKN/PINK1-linked Parkinson's disease. In addition, the comparison of patients with biallelic and heterozygous mutations in PRKN/PINK1 suggests a gene dosage effect. The differences in IL6 levels were validated in a second independent Italian cohort; (ii) a correlation between IL6 levels and disease duration in carriers of PRKN/PINK1 mutations, while no such association was observed for idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients. These results highlight the potential of IL6 as progression marker in Parkinson's disease due to PRKN/PINK1 mutations; (iii) increased circulating cell-free mtDNA serum levels in both patients with biallelic or with heterozygous PRKN/PINK1 mutations compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which is in line with previous findings in murine models. By contrast, circulating cell-free mtDNA concentrations in unaffected heterozygous carriers of PRKN/PINK1 mutations were comparable to control levels; and (iv) that circulating cell-free mtDNA levels have good predictive potential to discriminate between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease linked to heterozygous PRKN/PINK1 mutations, providing functional evidence for a role of heterozygous mutations in PRKN or PINK1 as Parkinson's disease risk factor. Taken together, our study further implicates inflammation due to impaired mitophagy and subsequent mtDNA release in the pathogenesis of PRKN/PINK1-linked Parkinson's disease. In individuals carrying mutations in PRKN/PINK1, IL6 and circulating cell-free mtDNA levels may serve as markers of Parkinson's disease state and progression, respectively. Finally, our study suggests that targeting the immune system with anti-inflammatory medication holds the potential to influence the disease course of Parkinson's disease, at least in this subset of patients.","2020",,"Brain"," We investigated IL6 , C-reactive protein , and circulating cell-free mtDNA in serum of 245 participants in two cohorts from tertiary movement disorder centres ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, DNA, Mitochondrial, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Inflammation, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Interleukin-6, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinsonian Disorders, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Protein Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

While it is known that REM sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) in PD is associated with motor and cognitive decline, little is known about the neurobiological significance of NREM sleep arousal-related disorders.
OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the cognitive and clinical correlates of arousal-related disorders in PD.
METHODS: Clinical data and video-polysomnography were analysed from one hundred-seventy consecutive subjects with PD. Based on the neuropsychological assessment, the subjects were divided into three groups: no cognitive impairment (PD; n = 58), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 58) and overt dementia (PDD; n = 54).
RESULTS: Arousal-related disorders by history were reported in 32.9% of the subjects: 10.3% PD, 31.6% PD-MCI and 59.3% PDD (p = 0.001). Video-PSG captured arousal-related disorders in 1.7% PD, 21.2% MCI-PD and 35.6% PDD (p = 0.001). Arousal-related disorders and RBD were recorded in the same night in 7.7% PD, 9.8% MCI-PD and 15.6% PDD (p = 0.04). Patients with arousal-related disorders captured at V-PSG have a longer disease duration (p = 0.003), higher UPDRS score (p = 0.039), longer duration of treatment with levodopa (p = 0.017) and dopamine agonists (p = 0.018), worse H&Y staging (p = 0.001), lower MMSE score (p = 0.019) and more frequently hallucinations (p = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, cognitive impairment significantly increases the risk of arousal-related disorders (OR 3.387-95% CI 1.395-8.220, p = 0.007).

However, it remains unknown whether orthostatic hypotension is a marker of prodromal PD or more advanced disease. The objectives of this study were to assess whether orthostatic hypotension is a prodromal marker of PD in the general population.
METHODS: This study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, a large prospective population-based cohort in the Netherlands. We measured orthostatic hypotension in 6910 participants. First, we determined the relation between prevalent PD and orthostatic hypotension using logistic regression. Second, we followed PD-free participants for the occurrence of PD until 2016 and studied the association between orthostatic hypotension and the risk of PD using Cox proportional hazards models. All models were adjusted for age and sex.
RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age ± standard deviation of the study population was 69.0 ± 8.8 years, and 59.1% were women. Orthostatic hypotension was present in 1245 participants (19.8%), and 62 participants (1.0%) had PD at the time of orthostatic hypotension measurement. Participants with PD were significantly more likely to have orthostatic hypotension (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.24). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 16.1 years (8.5-22.7 years), 122 participants were diagnosed with incident PD. Orthostatic hypotension at baseline was not associated with an increased risk of PD (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.58).

In this paper, we present: (i) the development and validation of an algorithm to detect turns during gait; (ii) a method to extract turn characteristics; and (iii) the classification of PD using turn characteristics. Thirty-seven people with PD and 56 controls performed 180-degree turns during an intermittent walking task. Inertial measurement units were attached to the head, neck, lower back and ankles. A turning detection algorithm was developed and validated by two raters using video data. Spatiotemporal and signal-based characteristics were extracted and used for PD classification. There was excellent absolute agreement between the rater and the algorithm for identifying turn start and end (ICC ≥ 0.99). Classification modeling (partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)) gave the best accuracy of 97.85% when trained on upper body and ankle data. Balanced sensitivity (97%) and specificity (96.43%) were achieved using turning characteristics from the neck, lower back and ankles.

,"32955462","Cognitive Dispersion Is Not Associated with Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease: Results from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) v500.0 Cohort.","Watermeyer T","BACKGROUND: Cognitive dispersion, variation in performance across cognitive domains, is posited as a non-invasive and cost-effective marker of early neurodegeneration. Little work has explored associations between cognitive dispersion and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in healthy older adults. Even less is known about the influence or interaction of biomarkers reflecting brain pathophysiology or other risk factors on cognitive dispersion scores.
OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to examine whether higher cognitive dispersion was associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-β (Aβ42), total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid positivity in a cohort of older adults at various severities of AD. A secondary aim was to explore which AD risk factors were associated with cognitive dispersion scores.
METHODS: Linear and logistic regression analyses explored the associations between dispersion and CSF levels of Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau and amyloid positivity (Aβ42 < 1000 pg/ml). Relationships between sociodemographics, APOEɛ4 status, family history of dementia, and levels of depression and dispersion were also assessed.
RESULTS: Dispersion did not emerge as associated with any of the analytes nor amyloid positivity. Older (β= -0.007, SE = 0.002, p = 0.001) and less educated (β= -0.009, SE = 0.003, p = 0.009) individuals showed greater dispersion.
CONCLUSION: Dispersion was not associated with AD pathology, but was associated with age and years of education, highlighting individual differences in cognitive aging. The use of this metric as a screening tool for existing AD pathology is not supported by our analyses.

,"32949236","Early ovarian ageing: is a low number of oocytes harvested in young women associated with an earlier and increased risk of age-related diseases?","Christensen MW","STUDY QUESTION: Do young women with early ovarian ageing (EOA), defined as unexplained, and repeatedly few oocytes harvested in ART have an increased risk of age-related events?
SUMMARY ANSWER: At follow-up, women with idiopathic EOA had an increased risk of age-related events compared to women with normal ovarian ageing (NOA).
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Early and premature menopause is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), osteoporosis and death. In young women, repeated harvest of few oocytes in well-stimulated ART cycles is a likely predictor of advanced menopausal age and may thus serve as an early marker of accelerated general ageing.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A register-based national, historical cohort study. Young women (≤37 years) having their first ART treatment in a public or private fertility clinic during the period 1995-2014 were divided into two groups depending on ovarian reserve status: EOA (n = 1222) and NOA (n = 16 385). Several national registers were applied to assess morbidity and mortality.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: EOA was defined as ≤5 oocytes harvested in a minimum of two FSH-stimulated cycles and NOA as ≥8 oocytes in at least one cycle. Cases with known causes influencing the ovarian reserve (endometriosis, ovarian surgery, polycystic ovary syndrome, chemotherapy etc.) were excluded. To investigate for early signs of ageing, primary outcome was an overall risk of ageing-related events, defined as a diagnosis of either CVD, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, cancer, cataract, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, by death of any-cause as well as a Charlson comorbidity index score of ≥1 or by registration of early retirement benefit. Cox regression models were used to assess the risk of these events. Exposure status was defined 1 year after the first ART cycle to assure reliable classification, and time-to-event was measured from that time point.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Median follow-up time from baseline to first event was 4.9 years (10/90 percentile 0.7/11.8) and 6.4 years (1.1/13.3) in the EOA and NOA group, respectively. Women with EOA had an increased risk of ageing-related events when compared to women with a normal oocyte yield (adjusted hazard ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.43). Stratifying on categories, the EOA group had a significantly increased risk for CVD (1.44, 1.19 to 1.75) and osteoporosis (2.45, 1.59 to 3.90). Charlson comorbidity index (1.15, 0.93 to 1.41) and early retirement benefit (1.21, 0.80 to 1.83) was also increased, although not reaching statistical significance.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Cycles never reaching oocyte aspiration were left out of account in the inclusion process and we may therefore have missed women with the most severe forms of EOA. We had no information on the total doses of gonadotrophin administered in each cycle.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings indicate that oocyte yield may serve as marker of later accelerated ageing when, unexpectedly, repeatedly few oocytes are harvested in young women. Counselling on life-style factors as a prophylactic effort against cardiovascular and other age-related diseases may be essential for this group of women.

This opinion paper presents our critical view on why EEG has so far failed to keep its promise, and where we believe EEG will be clinically useful for patients threatened with cognitive decline in the future. Individual EEGs are an integral outcome of many causally intermixing upstream factors contributing to dementia. Therefore, EEG cannot become a clinically useful ""simple"" stand-alone biomarker of some pathognomic accumulations of specific brain proteins, but rather offer unique opportunities for more comprehensive and richly faceted insights into the functional status of brain systems. EEG may thus remain an essential window into the brain when it comes to the at-risk and presymptomatic phases of dementias, where it can be uniquely informative about concepts such as burdens of plasticity and repair, cognitive reserve, and sleep.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may be among the first symptoms patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience. We examined whether DBI values are associated with SCD in older adults at risk of AD. We hypothesized that increased DBI would be associated with greater SCD at older ages.
METHOD: Two-hundred-six community-dwelling, English-speaking adults (age = 65 ± 9 years) at risk of AD (42% apolipoprotein ε4 carriers; 78% with AD family history) were administered a single question to ascertain SCD: ""Do you feel like your memory is becoming worse?"" Response options were ""No""; ""Yes, but this does not worry me""; and ""Yes, this worries me."" DBI values were derived from self-reported medication regimens using older adult dosing recommendations. Adjusting for relevant covariates (comorbidities and polypharmacy), we examined independent effects of age and DBI on SCD, as well as the moderating effect of age on the DBI-SCD association at mean ± 1 SD of age.
RESULTS: Both SCD and anticholinergic/sedative drug burden were prevalent. Greater drug burden was predictive of SCD severity, but age alone was not. A significant DBI*Age interaction emerged with greater drug burden corresponding to more severe SCD among individuals age 65 and older.

METHODS: We studied Framingham Heart Study participants who completed at baseline a serum CRP assessment and in-home polysomnography to measure sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), number of awakenings, arousal index, and apnea-hypopnea index. Participants were divided into groups according to their CRP level: low (<1 mg/L), average (1-3 mg/L), and high inflammation (>3 mg/L). Surveillance for outcomes (incident all-cause and Alzheimer's disease [AD] dementia) commenced at baseline and continued up to 22.5 years.
RESULTS: In 291 participants (mean age 67.5 ± 4.9 years, 51.6% men) followed for 13.4 ± 5.4 years, we observed 43 cases of all-cause dementia, 33 of which were clinically consistent with AD. Whereas no direct association between CRP or sleep exposures was observed with incident dementia, CRP levels interacted with nighttime wakefulness when predicting both incident all-cause and AD dementia. In the high CRP group, longer WASO (hazard ratio [HR], 2.89; 95% CI, 1.31-6.34) and more nighttime awakenings (HR, 4.55; 95% CI, 1.19-17.38) were associated with higher risk of incident dementia.

Evaluation of repetitive movements with finger tapping, which serves as a principal task to measure the extent of bradykinesia in PD, may undercover potential PD patients. The aim of this study was to explore whether finger tapping abnormalities, evaluated with a 3D motion capture system, are already present in RBD patients.
METHODS: Finger tapping data was acquired using a contactless 3D motion capture system from 40 RBD subjects and compared to 25 de-novo PD patients and 25 healthy controls. Objective assessment of amplitude decrement, maximum opening velocity and their combination representing finger tapping decrement was performed in the sequence of the first ten tapping movements. The association between instrumental finger tapping data and semi-quantitative clinical evaluation was analyzed.
RESULTS: While significant differences between PD and controls were found for all investigated finger tapping measures (p < 0.002), RBD differed from controls in finger tapping amplitude (p = 0.004) and velocity (p = 0.007) decrement but not in maximal opening velocity.

We investigated whether tau detected in plasma by our in-house NT1 assay is specifically altered in AD, and when applied to patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can serve to predict progression to AD dementia. The predictive value of NT1 versus tau measured using assays from Quanterix and Roche, and the specificity of NT1 for AD versus a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]) were also examined.
METHODS: NT1 tau and NfL were measured in plasma from prospectively followed patients with SCD or MCI who remained cognitively stable, converted to AD dementia, or converted to non-AD dementias, and in cognitively unimpaired participants. Tau was measured using Quanterix and Roche assays in baseline subjects with SCD and MCI.
RESULTS: Plasma NT1 tau was specifically elevated in AD, but not in non-AD dementia compared with controls, whereas NfL was increased in both AD and non-AD dementias. Baseline specimens from individuals who had SCD or MCI revealed that NT1 tau, but not tau measured using Quanterix or Roche assays, is elevated in subjects who progress to AD dementia. As expected, baseline plasma NfL is elevated in those who progress to AD and non-AD dementias.

Such impairments are likely to cause risky daily life behavior, for instance, in traffic. Impaired recognition of emotional expressions, such as fear, is considered a marker of impaired experience of emotions. Lower fear experience can, in turn, be related to risk-taking behavior. The aim of our study was to investigate whether impaired emotion recognition in patients with NDD is indeed related to unsafe decision-making in risky everyday life situations, which has not been investigated yet.
METHODS: Fifty-one patients with an NDD were included. Emotion recognition was measured with the Facial Expressions of Emotions: Stimuli and Test (FEEST). Risk-taking behavior was measured with driving simulator scenarios and the Action Selection Test (AST). Data from matched healthy controls were used: FEEST (n = 182), AST (n = 36), and driving simulator (n = 18).
RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients showed significantly worse emotion recognition, particularly of anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Furthermore, patients took significantly more risks in the driving simulator rides and the AST. Only poor recognition of fear was related to a higher amount of risky decisions in situations involving a direct danger.
CONCLUSIONS: To determine whether patients with an NDD are still fit to drive, it is crucial to assess their ability to make safe decisions.

,"32773379","Binocular Vision, Visual Function, and Pupil Dynamics in People Living With Dementia and Their Relation to the Rate of Cognitive Decline and Structural Changes Within the Brain: Protocol for an Observational Study.","Piano M","BACKGROUND: Visual impairment is a common comorbidity in people living with dementia. Addressing sources of visual difficulties can have a significant impact on the quality of life for people living with dementia and their caregivers. Depth perception problems are purportedly common in dementia and also contribute to falls, visuomotor task difficulties, and poorer psychosocial well-being. However, depth perception and binocular vision are rarely assessed in dementia research. Sleep fragmentation is also common for people living with dementia, and binocular cooperation for depth perception can be affected by fatigue. Pupillary responses under cognitive load also have the potential to be a risk marker for cognitive decline in people living with dementia and can be combined with the above measures for a comprehensive evaluation of clinical visual changes in people living with dementia and their relation to changes in cognitive status, sleep quality, and cortical structure or function.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the nature of clinical visual changes and altered task-evoked pupillary responses that may occur in people living with dementia and evaluate whether these responses relate to changes in cognitive status (standardized Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] score), Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and cortical structure or function.
METHODS: This proposed exploratory observational study will enroll ≤210 people with recently diagnosed dementia (within the last 24 months). The following parameters will be assessed on 3 occasions, 4 months apart (plus or minus 2 weeks): visual function (visual acuity and contrast sensitivity), binocular function (motor fusion and stereopsis), task-evoked pupillary responses (minimum and maximum pupil size, time to maximum dilation, and dilation velocity), cognitive status (MMSE score), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). A subset of patients (n=30) with Alzheimer disease will undergo structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging at first and third visits, completing a 10-day consensus sleep diary to monitor sleep quality, verified by sleep actimetry.
RESULTS: This research was funded in February 2018 and received National Health Service Research Ethics Committee approval in September 2018. The data collection period was from October 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019. A total of 24 participants were recruited for the study. The data analysis is complete, with results expected to be published before the end of 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings will demonstrate how often people with dementia experience binocular vision problems. If frequent, diagnosing and treating them could improve quality of life by reducing the risk of falls and fine visuomotor task impairment and by relieving psychosocial anxiety. This research will also demonstrate whether changes in depth perception, pupillary responses, and quality of vision relate to changes in memory or sleep quality and brain structure or function. If related, these quick and noninvasive eye tests help monitor dementia. This would help justify whether binocular vision and pupillary response testing should be included in dementia-friendly eye-testing guidelines.

METHODS: We studied 2,755 autopsied participants ≥55 years of age from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Participants had at least 1 clinical evaluation at US National Institute on Aging-funded Alzheimer's Disease Center no more than 2 years before death. Patients were classified as hearing impaired by clinician report at baseline. Common dementia neuropathologies included Alzheimer disease pathologic change (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuritic plaque density, neurofibrillary degeneration Braak stage), Lewy body disease, gross infarcts, and microinfarcts. Logistic regression models predicted impaired hearing with adjustment for age at death, sex, race, education, center, and follow-up time. Relative risks were calculated with the use of marginal standardization.
RESULTS: Impaired hearing was common (32%). In participants who were cognitively normal at baseline (n = 580), impaired hearing was associated with higher Braak stage (relative risk [RR] 1.33 per 2-stage increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.66) but not other pathologies. In participants with dementia (n = 2,175), impaired hearing was positively associated with microinfarcts (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39) and inversely associated with neuritic plaque density (RR 0.91 per score increase, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Development of impaired hearing in those with cognitive impairment was associated with neocortical Lewy bodies (1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.55).
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired hearing, reported before the onset of cognitive impairment, was associated with increased neurofibrillary tangle burden. Impaired hearing in those with cognitive impairment was associated with microinfarcts and neocortical Lewy bodies but not typical Alzheimer disease pathologic change.

An increase of both brain and atrial natriuretic peptide levels, particularly of the amino-terminal peptides (NT-proBNP and NT-proANP), represents a marker of cardiovascular damage. A link between increased NP levels and cognitive decline and dementia has been reported in several human studies performed both in general populations and in cohorts of patients affected by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In particular, it was reported that the elevation of NP levels in dementia can be both dependent and independent from CVD risk factors. In the first case, it may be expected that, by counteracting early on the cardiovascular risk factor load and the pathological processes leading to increased aminoterminal natriuretic peptide (NT-proNP) level, the risk of dementia could be significantly reduced. In case of a link independent from CVD risk factors, an increased NP level should be considered as a direct marker of neuronal damage. In the context of hypertension, elevated NT-proBNP and mid-regional (MR)-proANP levels behave as markers of brain microcirculatory damage and dysfunction.

However, IH is common in the general population and only a minority will develop PD. Identification of individuals with IH at prodromal stage of PD would serve to select them to implement neuroprotective agents, when available.
OBJECTIVE: To identify prodromal PD in IH patients using the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) research criteria for prodromal PD.
METHODS: We applied the MDS research criteria for prodromal PD to 25 consecutive patients older than 50 years who were self-referred for smell loss and had IH, and to 18 controls. A number of risk and prodromal PD markers were assessed in all participants including REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) by video-polysomnography and nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction by DAT-SPECT. After follow-up of 4.7 ± 2.2 years, participants were re-assessed to look for incident PD.
RESULTS: Prodromal PD probability was higher in patients than in controls (19.45 ± 34.9% versus 1.74 ± 4.48%; p = 0.019). Four (16%) patients met the criteria of prodromal PD surpassing 80% probability (99.8%, 99.5%, 88.3%, 86.4%). Three (12%) patients had RBD and four (16%) abnormal DAT-SPECT. At the end of follow-up, one (4%) IH patient who had RBD and baseline prodromal PD probability of 86.4% developed PD, while all controls remained disease free.

Circulating neurotoxic 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) autoantibodies were reported to increase in subsets of obese type 2 diabetes having microvascular complications. We tested whether 5-HT2AR autoantibodies increase in adults following traumatic brain injury in association with neurodegenerative complications.
METHODS: Plasma from thirty-five middle-aged and older adult veterans (mean 65 years old) who had suffered traumatic brain injury was subjected to protein-A affinity chromatography. The resulting immunoglobulin (Ig) G fraction was tested for neurotoxicity (acute neurite retraction, and accelerated cell death) in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells or for binding to a linear synthetic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop region of the human 5-HT2A receptor.
RESULTS: Nearly two-thirds of traumatic brain injured-patients harbored 5-HT2AR autoantibodies in their circulation. Active TBI autoantibodies caused neurite retraction in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells and accelerated N2A cell loss which was substantially prevented by co-incubation with a two hundred and fifty nanomolar concentration of M100907, a highly selective 5-HT2AR antagonist. Antagonists of RhoA/Rho kinase and Gq11/phospholipase C/inositol triphosphate receptor signaling pathways blocked TBI autoantibody-induced neurite retraction. Following traumatic brain injury, autoantibody binding to a 5-HT2A receptor peptide was significantly increased in patients having co-morbid Parkinson's disease (n=3), dementia (n=5), and painful neuropathy (n=8) compared to TBI subsets without neurologic or microvascular complication (n=20). Autoantibody titer was significantly elevated in TBI subsets experiencing multiple neurotraumatic exposures vs. single TBI. Plasma white blood cell, a marker of systemic inflammation, correlated significantly (correlation coefficient r =0.52; P < 0.01) with, 5-HT2A receptor peptide binding of the TBI-autoantibody.

Mild TBI (mTBI) contributes to up to 90% of all TBIs, and the classification ""mild"" often misrepresents the patient's burden who suffer from neuropsychiatric long-term sequelae. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows in vivo detection of compromised brain metabolism although it is not routinely used after TBI.
OBJECTIVE: Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate if MRS has the potential to identify changes in brain metabolism in adult patients after a single mTBI with a negative routine brain scan (CCT and/or MRI scan) compared to aged- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) during the acute or subacute postinjury phase (≤90 days after mTBI).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from the first edition of electronic databases until January 31, 2020. Group analyses were performed per metabolite using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Four and 2 out of 5,417 articles met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and systematic review, respectively. For the meta-analysis, 50 mTBI patients and 51 HC with a mean age of 31 and 30 years, respectively, were scanned using N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a marker for neuronal integrity. Glutamate (Glu), a marker for disturbed brain metabolism, choline (Cho), a marker for increased cell membrane turnover, and creatine (Cr) were used in 2 out of the 4 included articles. Regions of interests were the frontal lobe, the white matter around 1 cm above the lateral ventricles, or the whole brain. NAA was decreased in patients compared to HC with an effect size (ES) of -0.49 (95% CI -1.08 to 0.09), primarily measured in the frontal lobe. Glu was increased in the white matter in 22 mTBI patients compared to 22 HC (ES 0.79; 95% CI 0.17-1.41). Cho was decreased in 31 mTBI patients compared to 31 HC (ES -0.31; 95% CI -0.81 to 0.19). Cr was contradictory and, therefore, potentially not suitable as a reference marker after mTBI.

Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is an at-risk state for cognitive decline and dementia, characterized by emergent NPS in later life. MBI has significantly higher dementia incidence than late life psychiatric conditions. However, its utility as a proxy for neurodegeneration has not been demonstrated. Plasma neurofilament light (NfL) is a validated biomarker of axonal damage, and has been shown to associate with hallmarks of neurodegeneration.

METHODS: We evaluated the association of MBI with changes in NfL in a cohort (n = 584; MBI + n = 190, MBI- n = 394) of non-demented participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. MBI was determined by transforming Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire items using a published algorithm. Change in NfL was calculated over 2 years.
RESULTS: Time*MBI status was the only significant interaction to predict change in NfL concentrations (F(1,574) = 4.59, p = 0.032), even after controlling for age, mild cognitive impairment, and demographics. Analyses reclassifying 64 participants with new onset MBI over 2 years similarly demonstrated greater increases in NfL (F(1,574) = 5.82, p = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest MBI is a clinical proxy of early phase neurodegeneration with putative utility in identifying those at dementia risk. MBI can be used as a case ascertainment approach to capture those at high risk for cognitive decline and dementia, and is an important construct for clinicians dealing with cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptomatology in older adults.","2020",,"J Alzheimers Dis"," OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this investigation was to identify associations between NfL rate of change and the presence of MBI symptomatology ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Intermediate Filaments, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neurofilament Proteins, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Due to the strong links between systemic inflammation, delirium and dementia we hypothesized that responses within the brain in patients who develop delirium could show biochemical overlap with patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this observational study we analyzed protein expression signatures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 15 patients with infectious delirium and compared these to 29 patients with AD, 30 infectious patients without delirium and 15 non-infectious controls free of neurological disease. A proximity extension assay was performed measuring a total of 184 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins. Eight inflammatory proteins (4%), including the key neuron-microglia communication marker CX3CL1 (fractalkine), were significantly upregulated in both delirium and AD, compared to infectious patients without delirium. Likewise, 23 proteins (13%) showed downregulation in both delirium and AD, relative to infectious patients without delirium, which interestingly included CD200R1, another neuron-microglia communication marker, as well as a cluster of proteins related to synapse formation and function. Synaptopathy is an early event in AD and correlates strongly with cognitive dysfunction. These results were partially mediated by aging, which is an important predisposing risk factor among many others for both conditions. Within this study we report the first in vivo human evidence suggesting that synapse pathology and loss of homeostatic microglial control is involved in the pathophysiology of both infectious delirium and AD and thus may provide a link for the association between infections, delirium and long-term cognitive decline.","2020",,"Brain Behav Immun",,"observational study","Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, Delirium, TRUE, Down-Regulation, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Microglia, FALSE, Synapses, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"32591008","Imaging the aging brain: study design and baseline findings of the SENIOR cohort.","Haeger A","BACKGROUND: Current demographic trends point towards an aging society entailing increasing occurrence and burden of neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, understanding physiological aging and its turning point into neurodegeneration is essential for the development of possible biomarkers and future therapeutics of brain disease.
METHODS: The SENIOR study represents a longitudinal, observational study including cognitively healthy elderlies aged between 50 and 70 years old at the time of inclusion, being followed annually over 10 years. Our multimodal protocol includes structural, diffusion, functional, and sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T and 7 T, positron emission tomography (PET), blood samples, genetics, audiometry, and neuropsychological and neurological examinations as well as assessment of neuronal risk factors.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-two participants (50% females) were enrolled in the SENIOR cohort with a mean age of 60 (SD 6.3) years at baseline. Baseline results with multiple regression analyses reveal that cerebral white matter lesions can be predicted by cardiovascular and cognitive risk factors and age. Cardiovascular risk factors were strongly associated with juxtacortical and periventricular lesions. Intra-subject across-test variability as a measure of neuropsychological test performance and possible cognitive marker predicts white matter volume and is significantly associated with risk profile. Division of the cohort into subjects with a higher and lower risk profile shows significant differences in intra-subject across-test variability and volumes as well as cortical thickness of brain regions of the temporal lobe. There is no difference between the lower- and higher-risk groups in amyloid load using PET data from a subset of 81 subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: We here describe the study protocol and baseline findings of the SENIOR observational study which aim is the establishment of integrated, multiparametric maps of normal aging and the identification of early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. We show that intra-subject across-test variability as a marker of neuropsychological test performance as well as age, gender, and combined risk factors influence neuronal decline as represented by decrease in brain volume, cortical thickness, and increase in white matter lesions. Baseline findings will be used as underlying basis for the further implications of aging and neuronal degeneration as well as examination of brain aging under different aspects of brain pathology versus physiological aging.","2020",,"Alzheimers Res Ther"," We here describe the study protocol and baseline findings of the SENIOR observational study which aim is the establishment of integrated , multiparametric maps of normal aging and the identification of early biomarkers for neurodegeneration ","observational study","Aged, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, Brain, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Positron-Emission Tomography, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

,"32568785","Alzheimer Gene BIN1 may Simultaneously Influence Dementia Risk and Androgen Deprivation Therapy Dosage in Prostate Cancer.","Lehrer S","BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is extensively used in prostate cancer. Yet the risk of impaired cognition or Alzheimer disease (AD) in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT is uncertain. Some studies of prostate cancer and ADT suggest that the risk of AD is not increased. But other studies have found an increased risk of AD and cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVES: As the uncertainty about ADT and dementia might relate to the genetics of prostate cancer and AD, the authors used the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the relationship in men with prostate cancer between genes implicated in AD and genes implicated in prostate cancer.
METHODS: The authors examined the genomics of 492 prostate cancer cases in the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) TCGA Prostate Cancer (PRAD) data set. To access and analyze the data, 2 web-based interfaces were used: (1) the UCSC Xena browser, a web-based visual integration and exploration tool for TCGA data, including clinical and phenotypic annotations; and (2) cBioportal, a web-based interface that enables integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles.
RESULTS: Co-occurrence analysis indicates that alterations in the prostate cancer gene Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) significantly co-occur with alterations in the AD gene BIN1 (P<0.001). The presence of somatic mutations (deleterious and missense/in frame) in SPOP deranges BIN1 gene expression. SPOP/BIN1 RNA gene expression in 492 prostate cancer specimens is significantly correlated (P<0.001). Increased expression of SPOP in 492 prostate cancers is associated with reduced survival (P=0.00275). Men receiving pharmacologic therapy had a tumor with a significantly higher Gleason score (P=0.023). Gleason score and BIN1 RNA gene expression, unit log2 (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads upper quartile [FPKM-UQ]+1), in 499 prostate cancer specimens were significantly inversely correlated (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: BIN1 forms part of a network that interacts with the MYC oncogene, activated at the earliest phases of prostate cancer and in its position on chr8q24 linked to disease aggressiveness. Dynamic regulation of the BIN1-Tau interaction is involved in AD. BIN1 loss in AD allows phosphorylated tau to be mis-sorted to synapses, which likely alters the integrity of the postsynapse, alongside reducing the functionally important release of physiological forms of tau. Alzheimer symptoms are usually preceded by a preclinical phase that may be 16 years long. The authors suggest that the ADT dosage reflects the severity of a process that is already underway. The severity is determined by the genetics of the tumor itself, at least in part by BIN1. ADT is not causing new cases of AD. The oncologist treats higher-grade prostate cancer with more ADT, which serves as a surrogate marker for disease severity. Our analysis of TCGA data does not support the idea that ADT causes AD or dementia.","2020",,"Am J Clin Oncol"," OBJECTIVES : As the uncertainty about ADT and dementia might relate to the genetics of prostate cancer and AD , the authors used the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) to examine the relationship in men with prostate cancer between genes implicated in AD and genes implicated in prostate cancer ","other","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Androgen Antagonists, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nuclear Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Prostatic Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Repressor Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Risk Factors, FALSE, Tumor Suppressor Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Biomarkers, including those that are cerebrospinal fluid or brain imaging based, have yet to provide the ultimate marker variable. A need currently exists for a non-invasive, easy to administer biomarker that contains aMCI/AD specific pathognomic information.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present investigation was to provide an updated review of the Flash Visual Evoked Potential-P2 (FVEP-P2) as a biomarker for aMCI and AD. The FVEP-P2 has been shown to possess AD specific pathognomic information.
METHOD: A review was conducted of all articles published between the years 1976 and 2019 that examined the clinical utility of the FVEP-P2 in the diagnosis of aMCI or AD. Only 17 published investigations met the criteria of the review.
RESULT: The weighted average effect size, as measured by Cohen's d, was 1.07, with patients diagnosed with either aMCI or AD exhibiting a significant delay in the FVEP-P2 latency. The weighted mean latency for the controls was 143.92 ms (SD = 17.13). The weighted mean latency for the aMCI/AD was 164.02 ms (SD = 21.33).

Identification of MPS progression markers may be vital for preventive management, yet has not been pursued. This study aimed to ascertain clinical/neuroimaging features predictive of MPS progression.
METHODS: 205 participants in the Health ABC Study were included. MPS was defined using published guidelines. MPS progression was evaluated by determining UPDRS-III change between baseline and follow-up ≥2 years later. Standard brain MRI and DTI were obtained at baseline. Correlation coefficients between demographics, vascular risk factors, imaging markers, and UPDRS-III change were adjusted for follow-up time. Linear regression was used to adjust for possible confounders in the relationship between imaging markers and MPS progression.
RESULTS: 30% of participants had baseline MPS. Demographics and risk factors did not differ significantly between participants with MPS (MPS+) and without MPS (MPS-). Mean follow-up time was 3.8±0.8 years. Older age, male gender, diabetes were associated with faster rate of UPDRS-III change in MPS- but not MPS+ participants. Among MPS- participants, the only imaging marker associated with faster UPDRS-III progression was higher gray matter mean diffusivity (MD), widespread in various cortico-subcortical bihemispheric regions, independent of age, gender, diabetes. No imaging features were associated with UPDRS-III change among MPS+ participants.

RESULTS: A lower cognitive function was noted in hemodialysis patients compared to control subjects. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) was the only bone marker found to be associated with cognitive function (MoCA and CASI tests) in hemodialysis patients without a prior stroke or dementia diagnosis. In stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, the association remained significant in MoCA (

Some studies have found increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment in patients treated with ADT.
AIM: Since the uncertainty about ADT and dementia might relate to the genetics of prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease, we used the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the relationship between genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease and genes implicated in prostate cancer in men with prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The genomics of 492 prostate cancer cases in the Genomic Data Commons TCGA Prostate Cancer data set were examined.
RESULTS: Alterations (mutation, amplification or deletion) in prostate cancer gene speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) significantly co-occurred with alterations in Alzheimer's disease gene bridging integrator-1 (BIN1). Alterations in prostate cancer gene spectrin alpha 1 (SPTA1) significantly co-occurred with alterations in Alzheimer's disease gene CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) (p<0.001). The presence of somatic mutations (deleterious and missense/in frame) in SPOP disturbs BIN1 gene expression. SPOP and BIN1 RNA expression in 492 prostate cancer specimens was significantly positively correlated (p<0.001). Increased expression of SPOP in 492 cases of prostate cancer was associated with reduced survival (p=0.00275). BIN1 forms part of a network that interacts with the MYC oncogene, which is activated at the earliest phases of prostate cancer and is linked to disease aggressiveness. Men receiving ADT had tumor with a significantly higher Gleason score (p=0.023). Gleason score and BIN1 RNA expression in 499 prostate cancer specimens were significantly correlated (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The severity of prostate cancer is determined by the genetics of the tumor itself, possibly at least in part by the interactions of SPOP/BIN1, MYC/BIN1 and SPTA1/CD2AP. Oncologists treats higher grade prostate cancer with more ADT, which serves as a surrogate marker for disease severity. A weakness of our study is that we did not examine Alzheimer's disease or dementia at all in patients with cancer, only co-occurrence of genetic alterations.

,"32279019","Mild behavioral impairment in Parkinson's disease is associated with altered corticostriatal connectivity.","Lang S","BACKGROUND: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a syndrome characterized by later life onset, sustained neuropsychiatric symptoms as a marker of dementia risk. In Parkinson's disease (PD), MBI has been associated with worse cognitive abilities and increased cortical atrophy. However, the circuit level correlates of MBI have not been investigated in this population. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between MBI and corticostriatal connectivity in PD patients. This emphasis on corticostriatal connectivity was due to the significant role of these circuits in neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms across disease conditions.
METHODS: Seventy-four non-demented patients with PD were administered the MBI-checklist, and classified as having high MBI (PD-MBI; n = 21) or low MBI scores (PD-noMBI; n = 53). Corticostriatal connectivity was assessed with both an atlas and seed-based analysis. The atlas analysis consisted of calculating the average connectivity between the striatal network and the default mode (DMN), central executive (CEN), and saliency networks (SAN). Structural measurements of cortical thickness and volume were also assessed. PD-MBI and PD-noMBI patients were compared, along with a group of age matched healthy control subjects (HC; n = 28). Subsequently, a seed analysis assessed the relationship of MBI scores with the connectivity of twelve seeds within the striatum while controlling for cognitive ability. A complementary analysis assessed the relationship between striatal connectivity and cognition, while controlling for MBI-C.
RESULTS: PD-MBI demonstrated decreased connectivity between the striatum and both the DMN and SAN compared to PD-noMBI and HC. The decreased connectivity between the striatum and the SAN was explained partly by increased atrophy within the SAN in PD-MBI. The seed analysis revealed a relationship between higher MBI scores and lower connectivity of the left caudate head to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left middle frontal gyrus. Higher MBI-C scores were also related to decreased connectivity of the right caudate head with the anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and left supramarginal gyrus, as well as increased connectivity to the left hippocampus and right cerebellar hemisphere. Caudate-precuneus connectivity was independently associated with both global behavioural and cognitive scores.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest PD-MBI is associated with altered corticostriatal connectivity, particularly between the head of the caudate and cortical regions associated with the DMN and SAN. In particular, caudate-precuneus connectivity is associated with both global behavioral and cognitive symptoms in PD.","2020",,"Neuroimage Clin"," Our objective was to investigate the relationship between MBI and corticostriatal connectivity in PD patients ","other","Aged, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Brain Mapping, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Male, FALSE, Mental Disorders, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Neural Pathways, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

OBJECTIVE: Investigate associations between a probabilistic marker of preclinical AD, delirium, and long-term cognitive decline.
METHODS: The Successful Aging after Elective Surgery cohort includes older adults (≥70 years) without dementia who underwent elective surgery. 140 patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and had≥6 months cognitive follow-up. Cortical thickness was measured in 'AD-Signature' regions. Delirium was evaluated each postoperative day by the Confusion Assessment Method. Cognitive performance was assessed using a detailed neuropsychological battery at baseline; months 1, 2, and 6; and every 6 months thereafter until 36 months. Using either a General Cognitive Performance composite (GCP) or individual test scores as outcomes, we performed linear mixed effects models to examine main effects of AD-signature atrophy and the interaction of AD-signature atrophy and delirium on slopes of cognitive change from post-operative months 2-36.
RESULTS: Reduced baseline AD-signature cortical thickness was associated with greater 36-month cognitive decline in GCP (standardized beta coefficient, β = -0.030, 95% confidence interval [-0.060, -0.001]). Patients who developed delirium who also had thinner AD signature cortex showed greater decline on a verbal learning test (β = -0.100 [-0.192, -0.007]).

This involves not only central nervous system structures outside the substantia nigra and neurotransmitter systems other than the dopaminergic system, but also the peripheral nervous systems. Different ways of alpha-synuclein spreading are presumed, corresponding to typical prodromal non-motor symptoms like constipation, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and hyposmia. Moreover, many risk and prodromal markers have been identified and combined in the prodromal research criteria, which can be used to calculate an individual's probability of being in the prodromal phase of PD. Apart from specific genetic risk markers, including most importantly GBA- and LRRK2 mutations, RBD is currently the most important prodromal marker, predicting PD with a very high likelihood. This makes individuals with RBD a promising cohort for future clinical trials to detect and treat PD in its prodromal phase.

METHODS: We studied children from the Generation R Study, a prospective birth cohort. APOE genotypes and polygenic genetic burdens for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia were obtained through genome-wide genotyping. Non-verbal intelligence was assessed through cognitive tests at the research center around the age of 6 years, and educational attainment through a national school performance test around the age of 11 years. The Child Behavior Checklist was administered around the age of 10 years, and data from the anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, and the internalizing behavior problems scales were used. Children participated in a neuroimaging study when they were 10 years old, in which structural brain metrics were obtained. Lipid serum profiles, which may be influenced by APOE genotype, were assessed from venal blood obtained around the age of 6 years.

It was mainly investigated through insufficient tooth number, disregarding contact between opposing teeth (dental occlusion). The ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein (APOE4) is the primary genetic marker for the late onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, APOE4 and dental occlusion have not yet been investigated as possible associated risk factors for AD. The study was aimed to examine the impact of dental status and different APOE gene variants on AD occurrence. Secondly, sociodemographic variables were investigated as factors potentially associated with AD. The case-control study included two groups: 116 patients with AD (according to the NINDS-ADRDA criteria) and 63 controls (Mini-Mental State Examination scores ≥24). The analysis of APOE gene polymorphism was conducted through PCR reaction. Dental examination included recording of number of teeth, presence of fixed or removable dentures, and number of functional tooth units (FTU). Regression analysis was used to investigate the joint effect of the clinical and genetic variables on AD.

Amyloid deposition is considered as a central event which induces the link between the production of β amyloid and vascular changes. Presence of numerous biomarkers such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microvascular changes, senile plaques, changes in white matter, granulovascular degeneration specifies the manifestation of AD while an aggregation of tau protein is considered as a primary marker of AD. Likewise, microvascular changes, activation of microglia (immune defense system of CNS), amyloid-beta aggregation, senile plaque and many more biomarkers are nearly found in all Alzheimer's patients. It was seen that 70% of Alzheimer's cases occur due to genetic factors. It has been reported in various studies that apolipoprotein E(APOE) mainly APOE4 is one of the major risk factors for the later onset of AD. Several pathological changes also occur in the white matter which include dilation of the perivascular space, loss of axons, reactive astrocytosis, oligodendrocytes and failure to drain interstitial fluid.

This systematic review aims to evaluate the association of (sub)clinical CAD with cognitive function, cognitive decline, and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science until February 2019, supplemented with citations tracking. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted information including odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs).
RESULTS: Forty-six studies, 10 on CAC and 36 on clinical CAD, comprising 1,248,908 participants were included in the systematic review. Studies about associations of (sub)clinical CAD with cognitive function and cognitive decline had heterogeneous methodology and inconsistent findings.

Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that is associated with increased risk of poor clinical outcomes including falls, disability, and mortality. We aimed to investigate the relationship between AF and frailty and functionality in older adults.
METHODS: A total of 123 patients 64 with AF and 59 with normal sinus rhythm were enrolled in the study with cross-sectional design. All patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Frailty status was assessed using Fried criteria and FRAIL scale. The brief Older People's Quality of Life questionnaire was applied for quality of life. Results of the laboratory tests were recorded and compared for both groups.
RESULTS: Although the frequency of frailty status determined by the Fried criteria and the FRAIL scale was higher in the AF group, this difference was not statistically significant. However, it was found that there was a positive correlation between the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) AF symptom score and frailty according to the FRAIL scale (Goodman and Kruskal gamma coefficient = 0.39, p = 0.020). Comorbidities and polypharmacy were more common in the AF group (p < 0.001, both). CGA revealed lower Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores (p = 0.024), higher fall rates in the previous year (p = 0.016), and slower walking speed (p = 0.020) in the AF group. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, total protein, albumin, and prealbumin were lower; brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were higher in the AF group.

Chiral tandem liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems were applied for sensitive and selective amino acid species along with chiral species determination based on anion and zwitterion exchange mechanisms. In a comprehensive health cohort (cross-sectional study), we measured blood chiral amino acid levels from 305 women (65-80 years old) classified into Control, Mild-cognitive-Impairment (MCI), and Dementia groups using the Mini-Mental State Examination. MCI exhibited higher D-Pro (D-Pro/(D-Pro + L-Pro)) proportion vs the Control group, suggesting this proportion as a useful biomarker for MCI. Biomarker accuracy was improved in combination with D-Ser proportion.

However, the molecular links between PD and diabetes remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy in dopaminergic (DA) cells under high-glucose (HG) conditions. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, TXNIP was upregulated and autophagy was inhibited in the midbrain, while the loss of DA neurons was accelerated by hyperglycemia. In cultured PC12 cells under HG, TXNIP expression was upregulated and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased, leading to cell death. Autophagic flux was further blocked and PINK1 expression was decreased under HG conditions. Parkin expression in the mitochondrial fraction and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP)-induced co-localization of COX IV (marker for mitochondria) and LAMP1 (marker for lysosomes) were also significantly decreased by HG. Overexpression of TXNIP was sufficient to decrease the expression of both PINK1 and Parkin in PC12 cells, while knockdown of the expression of TXNIP by siRNA decreased intracellular ROS and attenuated cellular injury under HG. Moreover, inhibition of TXNIP improved the CCCP-induced co-localization of COX IV and LAMP1 in PC12 cells under HG.

Since, D-ribose shows highest glycation ability among other sugars hence, produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs) rapidly. However, there are several other mechanisms suggested by researchers through which D-ribose may cause cognitive impairments. There is a concern related to diabetic patients since they also suffer from D-ribose metabolism, may be more prone to AD risk.

Consistent with AD patients' distinctive deficit in consolidating new memory traces, in a recent study we demonstrated that the forgetting rate on the recency portion of a word list differentiates AD from other forms of dementia. In line with this finding, the aim of this study was to investigate whether increased recency forgetting could be a reliable index for predicting amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients' conversion to AD. For this purpose, we compared accuracy in immediate and delayed recall from different portions of a word list in a group of patients with amnestic MCI who converted (C-MCI) or did not convert (S-MCI) to AD during a three-year follow-up period and in a group of normal controls. The results of the present study show that the forgetting from the recency portion of the list (operationalized as a ratio between immediate and delayed recall) was significantly larger in C-MCI than in S-MCI patients. Consistently, the hierarchical logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the recency ratio is a strong predictor of group membership. Similar to what occurs in full-blown AD patients, the results of our study suggest that the increased forgetting rate from the recency portion of the list in C-MCI patients is due to severely reduced efficiency in converting transitory short-term memory representations into stable long-term memory traces. This is consistent with prominent involvement of neuropathological changes in the cortical areas of the medial-temporal lobes and suggests that the recency ratio is a cognitive marker able to identify MCI patients who have a greater likelihood of progressing to AD.","2020",,"J Alzheimers Dis"," In line with this finding , the aim of this study was to investigate whether increased recency forgetting could be a reliable index for predicting amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) patients ' conversion to AD ","other","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Disease Progression, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Memory Disorders, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Memory, Short-Term, FALSE, Mental Recall, FALSE, Mental Status and Dementia Tests, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, TRUE, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Reproducibility of Results, FALSE, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) can detect nerve injury non-invasively and may be a useful surrogate marker for WMH. The objective is to determine whether corneal nerve pathology identified using CCM is associated with the presence of WMH in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study where 196 consecutive individuals with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled and underwent neurological examination, MRI brain imaging and CCM. Participants underwent blinded quantification of WMH and corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD) and corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL).
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension [P = .013] was significantly higher and CNFD [P = .031] was significantly lower in patients with WMH compared to those without WMH. CNFD and CNFL were significantly lower in patients with DM without WMH [P = .008, P = .019] and in patients with DM and WMH [P = .042, P = .024] compared to patients without DM or WMH, respectively. In a multivariate model, a 1-unit decrease in the CNFD increased the risk of WMH by 6%, after adjusting for age, DM, gender, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, smoking, and HbA1c. DM was associated with a decrease in all CCM parameters but was not a significant independent factor associated with WMH.

Here, five transgenic mouse models expressing AD and frontotemporal dementia risk genes (i.e., PLB2APP, PLB2TAU, PLB1Double, PLB1Triple, and PLB4) were used to investigate if consistent alterations exist in multiple elements of the retinoic acid signaling pathway in these models. Many steps of the retinoic acid signaling pathway including binding proteins and metabolic enzymes decline, while the previously reported increase in RBP4 was only consistent at late (6 months) but not early (3 month) ages. The retinoic acid receptors were exceptional in their consistent decline in mRNA and protein with transcript decline of retinoic acid receptors β and γ by 3 months, before significant pathology, suggesting involvement in early stages of disease. Decline in RBP1 transcript may also be an early but not late marker of disease. The decline in the retinoic acid signaling system may therefore be a therapeutic target for AD and frontotemporal dementia. Thus, novel stable retinoic acid receptor modulators (RAR-Ms) activating multiple genomic and non-genomic pathways were probed for therapeutic control of gene expression in rat primary hippocampal and cortical cultures. RAR-Ms promoted the non-amyloidogenic pathway, repressed lipopolysaccharide induced inflammatory genes and induced genes with neurotrophic action.

Soluble amyloid precursor proteins (sAPPs) -α (sAPPα) and -β (sAPPβ), which are the byproducts of non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic process of APP, respectively, have been repeatedly observed in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of AD patients. The present study focused on the determination of sAPP levels in peripheral blood.
METHODS: The plasma protein levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ were measured with ELISA. Plasma from 52 AD patients, 98 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 114 cognitively normal controls were compared.
RESULTS: The plasma level of sAPPβ was significantly increased in AD patients than in cognitively healthy controls. However, no significant change in plasma sAPPα was observed among the three groups. Furthermore, the plasma sAPPβ levels significantly correlated with cognitive assessment scales, such as clinical dementia rating (CDR), and mini-mental status examination (MMSE). Interestingly, sAPPα and sAPPβ had a positive correlation with each other in blood plasma, similar to previous studies on CSF sAPP. This correlation was stronger in the MCI and AD groups than in the cognitively healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals with elevated plasma sAPPβ levels are at an increased risk of AD; elevation in these levels may reflect the progression of disease.","2020",,"Arch Gerontol Geriatr",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Disease Progression, FALSE, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Peptide Fragments, FALSE, blood, Q000097",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Poor self-reported sleep characteristics have been linked to cerebrovascular disease and dementia risk. However, little work has considered the relation of objectively assessed sleep characteristics and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), a marker of small vessel disease in the brain. Among 122 midlife women, we tested whether women with short or disrupted sleep would have greater WMH, adjusting for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, estradiol, and physiologically assessed sleep hot flashes.
METHODS: We recruited 122 women (mean age = 58 years) without a history of stroke or dementia who underwent 72 h of actigraphy to quantify sleep, 24 h of physiologic monitoring to quantify hot flashes; magnetic resonance imaging to assess WMH; phlebotomy, questionnaires, and physical measures (blood pressure, height, and weight). Associations between actigraphy-assessed sleep (wake after sleep onset and total sleep time) and WMH were tested in linear regression models. Covariates included demographics, CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes), estradiol, mood, and sleep hot flashes.
RESULTS: Greater actigraphy-assessed waking after sleep onset was associated with more WMH [B(SE) = .008 (.002), p = 0.002], adjusting for demographics, CVD risk factors, and sleep hot flashes. Findings persisted adjusting for estradiol and mood. Neither total sleep time nor subjective sleep quality was related to WMH.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that ICAD is associated with cerebral β-amyloid deposition as a marker of Alzheimer disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional analysis of data collected from August 2011 through November 2014 was a community-based cohort study conducted in 3 US communities. Of 346 adults without dementia aged 70 to 90 years who were sequentially recruited from 3 of 4 sites of the larger Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study into a study of brain florbetapir positron emission tomography (ARIC-PET), 300 met inclusion criteria. A total of 589 were approached about recruitment, of whom 346 (58.7%) consented (the remainder either met exclusion criteria for ARIC-PET or refused to participate). Data were analyzed from July 2017 through October 2019.
EXPOSURES: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease presence, frequency, and extent of stenosis, by high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Global cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of greater than 1.2 as measured by florbetapir PET. Models were conducted using logistic regression methods. In secondary analyses, we tested effect modifications by apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype with interaction terms and in stratified models and evaluated regional patterns of associations.
RESULTS: In 300 participants (mean [SD] age, 76 [5] years; 132 African American individuals [44%], 167 women [56%], and 94 carriers of at least 1 apolipoprotein E ε4 allele [31%]), ICAD was found in 105 participants (35%) and mean (SD) SUVR was higher in individuals with vs without intracranial plaques (1.34 [0.29] vs 1.27 [0.23]; P = .03).

The Czech Brain Aging Study (CBAS) is the first large, prospective study to address these issues in Central/Eastern Europe by enrolling non-demented adults aged 55+ years, collecting a variety of personal and biological measures and tracking cognitive function over time.
PARTICIPANTS: The CBAS recruitment was initiated in 2011 from memory clinics at Brno and Prague University Hospitals, and by the end of 2018, the study included 1228 participants. Annual follow-ups include collection of socioeconomic, lifestyle and personal history information, neurology, neuropsychology, laboratory, vital sign and brain MRI data. In a subset, biomarker assessment (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid positron emission tomography) and spatial navigation were performed. Participants were 69.7±8.1 years old and had 14.6±3.3 years of education at baseline, and 59% were women. By the end of 2018, 31% finished three and more years of follow-up; 9% converted to dementia. Apolipoprotein E status is available from 95% of the participants. The biological sample bank linked to CBAS database contained CSF, serum and DNA.
FINDINGS TO DATE: Overall, the findings, mainly from cross-sectional analyses, indicate that spatial navigation is a promising marker of early AD and that it can be distinguished from other cognitive functions. Specificity of several standard memory tests for early AD pathology was assessed with implications for clinical practice. The relationship of various lifestyle factors to cognition and brain atrophy was reported.
FUTURE PLANS: Recruitment is ongoing with secured funding. Longitudinal data analyses are currently being conducted.

Current studies investigating EEG coherence and power for specific brain areas and frequency bands have yielded inconsistent results. This study assessed EEG coherence and power indices at rest measured over the whole skull and for a wide frequency range as global EEG markers for cognition in a sample at risk for dementia. Since global markers are more reliable and less error-prone than region- and frequency-specific indices they might help to overcome previous inconsistencies. Global EEG coherence (1-30 Hz) and an EEG slowing score were assessed. The EEG slowing score was calculated by low-frequency power (1-8 Hz) divided by high-frequency power (9-30 Hz). In addition, the prognostic value of the two EEG indices for cognition and cognitive decline was assessed in a 5-year follow-up pilot study. Baseline global coherence correlated positively with cognition at baseline, but not with cognitive decline or with cognition at the 5-year follow-up. The EEG slowing ratio showed no significant association, neither with cognition at baseline or follow-up, nor with cognitive decline over a period of 5 years. The results indicate that the resting state global EEG coherence might be a useful and easy to assess electrophysiological correlate for neurocognitive health in older adults at risk for dementia. Because of the small statistical power for the follow-up analyses, the prognostic value of global coherence could not be determined in the present study.

We determined the association of telomere length with risk of Alzheimer's disease and all-cause dementia in a population-based setting. Within the Rotterdam Study, we performed quantitative PCR to measure mean leukocyte telomere length in blood. We determined the association of telomere length with risk of Alzheimer's disease until 2016, using Cox regression models. Of 1,961 participants (mean age 71.4±9.3 years, 57.1% women) with a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 237 individuals were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. We found a U-shaped association between telomere length and risk of Alzheimer's disease: compared to the middle tertile the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.59 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.23) for the lowest tertile and 1.47 (1.03-2.10) for the highest tertile.

Mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are a common cause of genetic FTD, causing either a behavioural presentation or, less commonly, language impairment. Presence on T2-weighted images of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) has been previously shown to be more commonly associated with GRN mutations rather than other forms of FTD. The aim of the current study was to investigate the longitudinal change in WMH and the associations of WMH burden with grey matter (GM) loss, markers of neurodegeneration and cognitive function in GRN mutation carriers. 336 participants in the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) study were included in the analysis: 101 presymptomatic and 32 symptomatic GRN mutation carriers, as well as 203 mutation-negative controls. 39 presymptomatic and 12 symptomatic carriers, and 73 controls also had longitudinal data available. Participants underwent MR imaging acquisition including isotropic 1 mm T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences. WMH were automatically segmented and locally subdivided to enable a more detailed representation of the pathology distribution. Log-transformed WMH volumes were investigated in terms of their global and regional associations with imaging measures (grey matter volumes), biomarker concentrations (plasma neurofilament light chain, NfL, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), genetic status (TMEM106B risk genotype) and cognition (tests of executive function). Analyses revealed that WMH load was higher in both symptomatic and presymptomatic groups compared with controls and this load increased over time. In particular, lesions were seen periventricularly in frontal and occipital lobes, progressing to medial layers over time. However, there was variability in the WMH load across GRN mutation carriers - in the symptomatic group 25.0% had none/mild load, 37.5% had medium and 37.5% had a severe load - a difference not fully explained by disease duration. GM atrophy was strongly associated with WMH load both globally and in separate lobes, and increased WMH burden in the frontal, periventricular and medial regions was associated with worse executive function. Furthermore, plasma NfL and to a lesser extent GFAP concentrations were seen to be associated with increased lesion burden. Lastly, the presence of the homozygous TMEM106B rs1990622 TT risk genotypic status was associated with an increased accrual of WMH per year. In summary, WMH occur in GRN mutation carriers and accumulate over time, but are variable in their severity. They are associated with increased GM atrophy and executive dysfunction. Furthermore, their presence is associated with markers of WM damage (NfL) and astrocytosis (GFAP), whilst their accrual is modified by TMEM106B genetic status. WMH load may represent a target marker for trials of disease modifying therapies in individual patients but the variability across the GRN population would prevent use of such markers as a global outcome measure across all participants in a trial.","2019",,"Neuroimage Clin"," The aim of the current study was to investigate the longitudinal change in WMH and the associations of WMH burden with grey matter ( GM ) loss , markers of neurodegeneration and cognitive function in GRN mutation carriers ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Asymptomatic Diseases, FALSE, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Executive Function, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Frontotemporal Dementia, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Gray Matter, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Heterozygote, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Membrane Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Neurofilament Proteins, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Organ Size, FALSE, Prodromal Symptoms, FALSE, Progranulins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Trail Making Test, FALSE, White Matter, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 167 subjects (aged 40-59 at baseline) from the PREVENT-Dementia programme underwent MRI scans on two separate occasions (mean interval 735 days; SD 44 days). We measured longitudinal rates of brain atrophy using the FSL Siena toolbox.
RESULTS: Annual percentage rates of brain volume and ventricular volume change were greater in those with a high (>6) vs low CAIDE score-absolute brain volume percentage loss 0.17% (CI 0.07 to 0.27) and absolute ventricular enlargement 1.78% (CI 1.14 to 2.92) higher in the at risk group. Atrophy rates did not differ between subjects with and without a parental history of dementia, but were significantly correlated with age. Using linear regression, with covariates of age, sex and education, CAIDE score >6 was the only significant predictor of whole brain atrophy rates (p=0.025) while age (p=0.009), sex (p=0.002) and CAIDE>6 (p=0.017) all predicted ventricular expansion rate.

AD pathology is known to disrupt brain regions instrumental in olfactory information processing, such as the primary olfactory cortex (POC), the hippocampus, and other temporal lobe structures. This selective vulnerability suggests that the functional connectivity (FC) between the olfactory network (ON), consisting of the POC, insula and orbital frontal cortex (OFC) (Tobia et al., 2016), and the hippocampus may be impaired in early stage AD. Yet, the development trajectory of this potential FC impairment remains unclear. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to investigate FC changes between the ON and hippocampus in four groups: aged-matched cognitively normal (CN), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and AD. FC was calculated using low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the ON and hippocampus (Tobia et al., 2016). We found that the FC between the ON and the right hippocampus became progressively disrupted across disease states, with significant differences between EMCI and LMCI groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences in gray matter hippocampal volumes between EMCI and LMCI groups. Lastly, the FC between the ON and hippocampus was significantly correlated with neuropsychological test scores, suggesting that it is related to cognition in a meaningful way. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence for the involvement of FC between the ON and hippocampus in AD pathology.

,"31771071","Continuous Real-World Gait Monitoring in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder.","Del Din S","BACKGROUND: Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have a high risk of developing PD, and thus can be used to study prodromal biomarkers. RBD has been associated with changes in gait; quantifying these changes using wearable technology is promising; however, most data are obtained in clinical settings precluding pragmatic application.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate if wearable-based, real-world gait monitoring can detect early gait changes and discriminate individuals with RBD from controls, and explore relationships between real-world gait and clinical characteristics.
METHODS: 63 individuals with RBD (66±10 years) and 34 controls recruited in the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre Discovery Study were assessed. Data were collected using a wearable device positioned on the lower back for 7 days. Real-world gait was quantified in terms of its Macrostructure (volume, pattern and variability (S2)) and Microstructure (14 characteristics). The value of Macro and Micro gait in discriminating RBD from controls was explored using ANCOVA and ROC analysis, and correlation analysis was performed between gait and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found in discrete Micro characteristics in RBD with reduced gait velocity, variability and rhythm (p≤0.023). These characteristics significantly discriminated RBD (AUC≥0.620), with swing time as the single strongest discriminator (AUC=0.652).

Although these models show highly increased aSyn expression they rarely capture dopaminergic cell loss and show a behavioural phenotype only at old age, whereas SNCA mutations are risk factors for PD with earlier onset. The aim of our study was to re-characterize a transgenic mouse strain carrying both A30P and A53T mutated human aSyn. Our study revealed decreased locomotor activity for homozygous transgenic mice starting from 3 months of age which was different from previous studies with this mouse strain that had behavioural deficits starting only after 7-9 months.

The current study examines associations between slow gait speed and transitions between cognitive states and death in later life.
METHODS: We performed a coordinated analysis of three longitudinal studies with 9 to 25 years of follow-up. Data were used from older adults participating in H70 (Sweden; n = 441; aged ≥70 years), InCHIANTI (Italy; n = 955; aged ≥65 years), and LASA (the Netherlands; n = 2824; aged ≥55 years). Cognitive states were distinguished using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Slow gait speed was defined as the lowest sex-specific quintile at baseline. Multistate models were performed, adjusted for age, sex and education.
RESULTS: Most effect estimates pointed in the same direction, with slow gait speed predicting forward transitions. In two cohort studies, slow gait speed predicted transitioning from mild to severe cognitive impairment (InCHIANTI: HR = 2.08, 95%CI = 1.40-3.07; LASA: HR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.01-1.75) and transitioning from a cognitively healthy state to death (H70: HR = 3.30, 95%CI = 1.74-6.28; LASA: HR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.30-2.21).

Our primary aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies investigating the association between anxiety and AD risk.
DESIGN: We searched multiple scientific databases to identify relevant papers published up to March 2019. Inclusion criteria were: prospective cohort studies with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year, baseline anxiety assessment, absence of dementia at baseline, investigated the association between anxiety and AD incidence, and reporting Relative Risks (RRs), or equivalents (HRs and SHRs), for the association between anxiety and AD risk. We excluded studies that: focused on subjective memory or mild cognitive impairment samples, review and meta-analyses, not reporting original, published peer-reviewed results. We used a random-effects model that accommodated the differences in association statistics.
RESULTS: 7 prospective cohorts (reported in 6 studies), with a total of 24,528 participants, were included in our meta-analysis. A marginally significant association between anxiety and AD risk was found, with a pooled RR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.00-2.12), and a population attributable fraction for AD of 2.8% (95% CI: 1.2%-4.3%).
LIMITATIONS: There was a high level of heterogeneity across the studies, which may be associated with differences in the covariates adjusted for. Studies also differed considerably in how they measured anxiety.

OD negatively impacts health and quality of life and its prevalence increases with advancing age. Since OD may be an early marker of dementia and impending death, more knowledge regarding risk factors of OD in aging is warranted. The objective was therefore to explore longitudinally which demographic, genetic, clinical, lifestyle, and cognitive factors predict the development of OD.
METHODS: The study included participants aged 60-90 years from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), who did not have OD at baseline and were reassessed with an odor identification task at a 6-year follow-up (n = 1,004). Risk factors of OD were assessed with multivariable logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: The percentage of incident OD cases was 14.2% over 6 years in the total sample and this number increased monotonically with age. Increasing age, carrying the ε4 allele of the APOE gene, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, and current smoking were found to be risk factors for the development of OD, whereas better olfactory identification and verbal episodic memory proficiency at baseline were identified as protective factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to nonmodifiable factors (age and genetic risk), several modifiable risk factors of OD were identified. This suggests that it might be possible to reduce OD incidence through the management of vascular risk factors and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.","2020",,"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci"," The objective was therefore to explore longitudinally which demographic , genetic , clinical , lifestyle , and cognitive factors predict the development of OD ","other","Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Olfaction Disorders, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

This study aimed to examine whether specific depressive dimensions were associated with pre-Alzheimer's disease dementia (pre-AD), separately for women and men. Data were drawn from 5617 (58% women) community-dwellers aged 65+ recruited in 1999-2000 and followed at 2-year intervals for 12 years. We used Cox proportional hazard models to study associations between time-dependent Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) symptom dimensions (namely somatic, depressed, positive affect, and interpersonal challenge) and pre-AD, defined retrospectively from validated diagnoses established 3.5 (IQR: 3.2-4.0) years onwards. Analyses were performed according to overall depressive symptomatology (DS+: CES-D score ≥ 16) and antidepressant/anxiolytic medication use (AA). Results indicated that in DS+ women only, all four dimensions were significantly associated with pre-AD in the AA- group, in particular somatic item 'Mind' and depressed affect items 'Depressed' and 'Blues'. The most depression-specific dimension, depressed affect, was also significantly associated with pre-AD in the DS- AA- women (HR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.12;1.47).

A better understanding of NfL dynamics is essential for upcoming therapeutic trials. We aimed to study longitudinal NfL trajectories in people with presymptomatic and symptomatic genetic frontotemporal dementia.
METHODS: We recruited participants from 14 centres collaborating in the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (GENFI), which is a multicentre cohort study of families with genetic frontotemporal dementia done across Europe and Canada. Eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) either had frontotemporal dementia due to a pathogenic mutation in GRN, C9orf72, or MAPT (symptomatic mutation carriers) or were healthy at-risk first-degree relatives (either presymptomatic mutation carriers or non-carriers), and had at least two serum samples with a time interval of 6 months or more. Participants were excluded if they had neurological comorbidities that were likely to affect NfL, including cerebrovascular events. We measured NfL longitudinally in serum samples collected between June 8, 2012, and Dec 8, 2017, through follow-up visits annually or every 2 years, which also included MRI and neuropsychological assessments. Using mixed-effects models, we analysed NfL changes over time and correlated them with longitudinal imaging and clinical parameters, controlling for age, sex, and study site. The primary outcome was the course of NfL over time in the various stages of genetic frontotemporal dementia.
FINDINGS: We included 59 symptomatic carriers and 149 presymptomatic carriers of a mutation in GRN, C9orf72, or MAPT, and 127 non-carriers. Nine presymptomatic carriers became symptomatic during follow-up (so-called converters). Baseline NfL was elevated in symptomatic carriers (median 52 pg/mL [IQR 24-69]) compared with presymptomatic carriers (9 pg/mL [6-13]; p<0·0001) and non-carriers (8 pg/mL [6-11]; p<0·0001), and was higher in converters than in non-converting carriers (19 pg/mL [17-28] vs 8 pg/mL [6-11]; p=0·0007; adjusted for age). During follow-up, NfL increased in converters (b=0·097 [SE 0·018]; p<0·0001). In symptomatic mutation carriers overall, NfL did not change during follow-up (b=0·017 [SE 0·010]; p=0·101) and remained elevated. Rates of NfL change over time were associated with rate of decline in Mini Mental State Examination (b=-94·7 [SE 33·9]; p=0·003) and atrophy rate in several grey matter regions, but not with change in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-Clinical Dementia Rating scale score (b=-3·46 [SE 46·3]; p=0·941).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings show the value of blood NfL as a disease progression biomarker in genetic frontotemporal dementia and suggest that longitudinal NfL measurements could identify mutation carriers approaching symptom onset and capture rates of brain atrophy. The characterisation of NfL over the course of disease provides valuable information for its use as a treatment effect marker.

Pathogenesis of AD depends on various factors, including APOE genetic variants, apolipoprotein E (apoE) phenotype and oxidative stress, which may promote both DNA and RNA damage, including non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Among ncRNAs, microRNA (miRNA) is known to contribute to pathologic processes in AD. The aim of the study was to analyse the plasma concentration of apoE by ELISA as well as the plasma levels of miR-107 and miR-650 by qPCR in relation to APOE genetic variants and clinical features including the age of onset and dementia severity in 64 AD patients and 132 controls.

Dementia constitutes the main reason for disability and dependency in the elderly. Identification of potential risk and protective factors, as well as determinants of conversion from MCI to dementia, is therefore crucial. In case of Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent dementia syndrome amongst the members of modern societies, neurodegenerative processes in the brain can begin many years before first clinical symptoms appear. First functional changes typically mean advanced neuron loss, therefore, the earliest possible diagnosis is critical for implementation of promising early pharmaceutical interventions.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to discuss the relationships between both circulating and brain cholesterol with cognition, and explore its potential role in early diagnosis of cognitive disorders.
METHODS: Literature review.
RESULTS: The causal role of high cholesterol levels in AD or MCI has not been confirmed. It has been postulated that plasma levels of 24(S)-OHC can potentially be used as an early biochemical marker of altered cholesterol homeostasis in the CNS.

In this meta-analysis we aimed to quantify the association of the co-occurrence of cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) and physical frailty with incident dementia.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used when reporting this review. We performed a systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for relevant articles. Longitudinal studies enrolling individuals with both CIND and physical frailty and reporting dementia incidence were eligible. Pooled estimates were obtained through random effect models and Mantel-Haenszel weighting.
RESULTS: Out of 3684 articles, five (14302 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. In comparison to participants free from frailty and CIND, the pooled hazard ratio for dementia was 3.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.64-5.56) for isolated CIND, 1.47 (95%CI: 0.89-2.40) for isolated physical frailty, and 5.36 (95%CI: 3.26-8.81) for their co-occurrence.

In this chapter, we briefly describe the physiological phenomena underlying MEG brain signals and the different metrics that can be computed from these data in order to study the alterations disrupting brain activity not only in demented patients, but also in the preclinical and prodromal stages of the disease. Changes in non-linear brain dynamics, power spectral properties, functional connectivity and network topological changes observed in AD are narratively summarized in the context of the pathophysiology of the disease. Furthermore, the potential of MEG as a potential biomarker to identify AD pathology before dementia onset is discussed in the light of current knowledge and the relationship between potential MEG biomarkers and current established hallmarks of the disease is also reviewed. To this aim, findings from different approaches such as resting state or during the performance of different cognitive paradigms are discussed.Lastly, there is an increasing interest in current scientific literature in promoting interventions aimed at modifying certain lifestyles, such as nutrition or physical activity among others, thought to reduce or delay AD risk.

METHODS: BV2 cells and N2A cells were treated with Aβ at different concentrations, and the viability, apoptosis and autophagy of these cells were further evaluated. The expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II, a marker of microglial activation), REST in the neurons and REST specific phosphorylase casein kinase 1 (CK1) were detected.
RESULTS: Aβ at a low concentration (2.5 µmol/L) could alter the microglial morphology, and the proportion of amoebic microglia and protein expression of MHC-II increased in a Aβ concentration dependent manner. Aβ at a high concentration (10 µmol/L) was able to reduce REST expression, elevate the expression of pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic genes, inhibit the expression of anti-apoptotic gene, and reduce the neuronal activity. REST expression reduced, but CK1 increased in neurons, and CK1 inhibitor significantly increased REST expression. there was co-expression of REST and CK1 in the brain of AD mice, which was characterized by reduced nuclear REST expression and elevated CK1 expression.

Digit Symbol Substitution Test in the Prediction of Alzheimer, Parkinson, Stroke, Disability, and Depression.","Amieva H","BACKGROUND: Dementia, stroke, depression, and disability are frequent in late life and are major causes of quality of life disruption and family burden. Even though each of these disorders relies on specific pathogenic processes, a common clinical manifestation is psychomotor slowing.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relevance of a simple marker of low psychomotor speed in predicting several brain outcomes: dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, depressive symptoms, and disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL).
METHODS: PAQUID is a population-based study involving 3,777 individuals aged 65 or older prospectively followed-up with repeated clinical evaluations. After 10 years, 437 participants developed dementia, 333 developed AD, 71 developed PD, 207 reported incident stroke, 404 developed disability in ADL, 994 in IADL, and 494 developed depressive symptomology. Psychomotor speed was measured with the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). Cox proportional hazards models controlled for several confounders assessed the risk of incident outcomes.
RESULTS: Participants with low DSST performance had increased risk of incident all-type dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 3.41, p < 0.0001) and AD-type dementia (HR 3.18, p < 0.0001). Higher risk for PD (HR 2.98, p = 0.04), IADL (HR 1.82, p < 0.0001), ADL disability (HR 1.95, p = 0.001), depressive symptoms (HR 1.53, p = 0.03), and a statistical trend for stroke (HR 1.88, p = 0.09) was also found.
CONCLUSION: Low psychomotor speed is associated with an increased risk of developing various brain outcomes: dementia, AD, PD, disability, depressive symptoms, and marginally stroke. Low psychomotor speed may be the consequence of a number of discrete cerebral abnormalities and could be considered as a marker of brain vulnerability.

In older age, ARHL is also a significant marker for frailty, another age-related multidimensional clinical condition with a nonspecific state of vulnerability, reduced multisystem physiological reserve, and decreased resistance to different stressors (i.e. sensorial impairments, psychosocial stress, diseases, injuries). The multidimensional nature of frailty required an approach based on different pathogeneses because this clinical condition may include sensorial, physical, social, nutritional, cognitive, and psychological phenotypes. In the present narrative review, the cumulative epidemiological evidence coming from several longitudinal population-based studies, suggested convincing links between peripheral ARHL and incident cognitive decline and dementia. Moreover, a few longitudinal case-control and population-based studies also suggested that age-related CAPD in ARHL, may be central in determining an increased risk of incident cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cumulative meta-analytic evidence confirmed cross-sectional and longitudinal association of both peripheral ARHL and age-related CAPD with different domains of cognitive functions, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia, while the association with dementia subtypes such as AD and vascular dementia remained unclear. However, ARHL may represent a modifiable condition and a possible target for secondary prevention of cognitive impairment in older age, social isolation, late-life depression, and frailty. Further research is required to determine whether broader hearing rehabilitative interventions including coordinated counseling and environmental accommodations could delay or halt cognitive and global decline in the oldest old with both ARHL and dementia.","2019",,"Ther Adv Chronic Dis",," review","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Recent evidence suggests that exposure to air pollution is also a risk factor for AD, and results from a few studies indicate that the effect of air pollution on cognitive function and dementia is stronger in APOEɛ4 carriers than in non-carriers. Air pollution and interaction with APOEɛ4 on AD risk thus merits further attention. We studied dementia incidence over a 15-year period from the longitudinal Betula study in Northern Sweden. As a marker for long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution, we used modelled annual mean nitrogen oxide levels at the residential address of the participants at start of follow-up. Nitrogen oxide correlate well with fine particulate air pollution levels in the study area. We had full data on air pollution, incidence of AD and vascular dementia (VaD), APOEɛ4 carrier status, and relevant confounding factors for 1,567 participants. As expected, air pollution was rather clearly associated with dementia incidence. However, there was no evidence for a modifying effect by APOEɛ4 on the association (p-value for interaction > 0.30 for both total dementia (AD+VaD) and AD).

As the population of persons living with HIV grows older and aged persons represent a significant number of new infections, it is important to understand how HIV may affect the aged brain. In the current study, both adult and aged mice were treated with HIV gp120 and trained in a reference memory version of the water maze. Analysis of probe data revealed that aged animals treated with gp120 demonstrated profound decrements in water maze performance compared to gp120 treated young animals and saline treated aged or young animals. Additionally, we examined the neuroinflammatory responses in the aged and adult brain 4 h after treatment with gp120. Pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with neuroinflammation are known to be antagonistic to learning and memory processes and aged and adult animals treated with gp120 demonstrated similar increases in IL-1β and IL-6 in the hippocampus and cortex. Additionally, gp120 treatment was associated with an increase in MHCII gene expression, a marker of microglial activation, in the hippocampus. Although, the aged brain demonstrated a similar inflammatory profile at the time point measured, aged animals were more sensitive to cognitive dysfunction related to gp120 treatment.

OBJECTIVE: to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between informant-based HD, which interfere with daily activities and the risk for MCI and dementia.
METHODS: the study included 4812 participants without dementia, enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (mean age (SD) 73.7 (9.6) years) with cognitive evaluation and informant-based report on participant's HD that interfere significantly with daily activities at baseline and for every 15 months. Cox proportional hazards models (utilising time-dependent HD status and age as the time scale) were used to examine HD and the risk for MCI or dementia, and mixed-effects models (allowing for random subject-specific intercepts and slopes) were used to examine the relationship between HD and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: about, 981 participants had HD and 612 (12.7%) had prevalent MCI at baseline; 759 participants developed incident MCI and 273 developed incident dementia. In cognitively unimpaired participants at baseline, those with HD had higher risk for MCI (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.10, 1.51), P = 0.002; adjusting for sex, years of education).

The aim of this study was to determine whether features of gait extracted from a vision-based system are associated with falls, and which of these features are most strongly associated with falling.
METHODS: Fifty-two people with dementia admitted to a specialized dementia unit participated in this study. Thirty different features describing baseline gait were extracted from Kinect recordings of natural gait over a 2-week period. Baseline clinical and demographic measures were collected, and falls were tracked throughout the participants' admission.
RESULTS: A total of 1,744 gait episodes were recorded (mean 33.5 ± 23.0 per participant) over a 2-week baseline period. There were a total of 78 falls during the study period (range 0-10). In single variable analyses, the estimated lateral margin of stability, step width, and step time variability were significantly associated with the number of falls during admission. In a multivariate model controlling for clinical and demographic variables, the estimated lateral margin of stability (p = .01) was remained associated with number of falls.

Many of the predictive values (likelihood ratios, LR) remain unchanged. The positive likelihood ratio notably increase for olfactory loss and decreased for substantia nigra hyperechogenicity. Negative likelihood ratio remained largely unchanged for all markers. New levels of diagnostic certainty for neurogenic and symptomatic orthostatic hypotension have been added, which substantially differ in positive likelihood ratio from the original publication. For intermediate strength genetic variants, their age-related penetrance is now incorporated in the calculation of the positive likelihood ratio. Moreover, apart from prospective studies, evidence from cross-sectional case-control genome-wide association studies is also considered (given their likely lack of confounding and reverse causation), and to account for the effect of multiple low-penetrance genetic variants polygenic risk scores are added to the model.

While the large expansions were shown to cause SCA2, the intermediate length expansions lead to increased risk for several atrophic processes including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson variants, e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy. Intense efforts to pioneer a neuroprotective therapy for SCA2 require longitudinal monitoring of patients and identification of crucial molecular pathways. The ataxin-2 (ATXN2) protein is mainly involved in RNA translation control and regulation of nutrient metabolism during stress periods. The preferential mRNA targets of ATXN2 are yet to be determined. In order to understand the molecular disease mechanism throughout different prognostic stages, we generated an Atxn2-CAG100-knock-in (KIN) mouse model of SCA2 with intact murine ATXN2 expression regulation. Its characterization revealed somatic mosaicism of the expansion, with shortened lifespan, a progressive spatio-temporal pattern of pathology with subsequent phenotypes, and anomalies of brain metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA), all of which mirror faithfully the findings in SCA2 patients. Novel molecular analyses from stages before the onset of motor deficits revealed a strong selective effect of ATXN2 on Nat8l mRNA which encodes the enzyme responsible for NAA synthesis. This metabolite is a prominent energy store of the brain and a well-established marker for neuronal health. Overall, we present a novel authentic rodent model of SCA2, where in vivo magnetic resonance imaging was feasible to monitor progression and where the definition of earliest transcriptional abnormalities was possible. We believe that this model will not only reveal crucial insights regarding the pathomechanism of SCA2 and other ATXN2-associated disorders, but will also aid in developing gene-targeted therapies and disease prevention.","2019",,"Neurobiol Dis",,"other","Acetyltransferases, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Animals, FALSE, Aspartic Acid, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Ataxin-2, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Gene Knock-In Techniques, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Male, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Transgenic, FALSE, Spinocerebellar Ataxias, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Trinucleotide Repeats, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Social contact is a potential target for clinical and public health studies, but previous observational studies had short follow-up, making findings susceptible to reverse causation bias. We therefore examined the association of social contact with subsequent incident dementia and cognition with 28 years' follow-up.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Whitehall II longitudinal prospective cohort study of employees of London civil service departments, aged 35-55 at baseline assessment in 1985-1988 and followed to 2017. Social contact was measured six times through a self-report questionnaire about frequency of contact with non-cohabiting relatives and friends. Dementia status was ascertained from three linked clinical and mortality databases, and cognition was assessed five times using tests of verbal memory, verbal fluency, and reasoning. Cox regression models with inverse probability weighting to account for attrition and missingness examined the association between social contact at age 50, 60, and 70 years and subsequent incident dementia. Mixed linear models examined the association of midlife social contact between 45 and 55 years and cognitive trajectory during the subsequent 14 years. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, health behaviours, employment status, and marital status. Of 10,308 Whitehall II study participants, 10,228 provided social contact data (mean age 44.9 years [standard deviation (SD) 6.1 years] at baseline; 33.1% female; 89.1% white ethnicity). More frequent social contact at age 60 years was associated with lower dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] for each SD higher social contact frequency = 0.88 [95% CI 0.79, 0.98], p = 0.02); effect size of the association of social contact at 50 or 70 years with dementia was similar (0.92 [95% CI 0.83, 1.02], p = 0.13 and 0.91 [95% CI 0.78, 1.06], p = 0.23, respectively) but not statistically significant. The association between social contact and incident dementia was driven by contact with friends (HR = 0.90 [95% CI 0.81, 1.00], p = 0.05), but no association was found for contact with relatives. More frequent social contact during midlife was associated with better subsequent cognitive trajectory: global cognitive function was 0.07 (95% CI 0.03, 0.11), p = 0.002 SDs higher for those with the highest versus lowest tertile of social contact frequency, and this difference was maintained over 14 years follow-up. Results were consistent in a series of post hoc analyses, designed to assess potential biases. A limitation of our study is ascertainment of dementia status from electronic health records rather than in-person assessment of diagnostic status, with the possibility that milder dementia cases were more likely to be missed.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest a protective effect of social contact against dementia and that more frequent contact confers higher cognitive reserve, although it is possible that the ability to maintain more social contact may be a marker of cognitive reserve. Future intervention studies should seek to examine whether improving social contact frequency is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in changing cognitive outcomes.","2019",,"PLoS Med",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Dementia, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Interpersonal Relations, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sex Factors, FALSE, Social Networking, FALSE, Socioeconomic Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

This study explored the link between salivary amyloid β42 level (as a surrogate marker for Alzheimer's pathology) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among old diabetic patients.
METHODS: A case-control study included 90 diabetic participants, ≥ 60 years of age, divided into 45 cases with MCI and 45 controls. Patients with history of head trauma, any central nervous system pathology, depression, dementia or delirium, those who received anticholinergic drugs, or refused to participate in the study were excluded.

,"31362787","A soluble tau fragment generated by caspase-2 is associated with dementia in Lewy body disease.","Smith BR","Lewy body diseases are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by Lewy bodies in the brain. Lewy body dementia (LBD) refers to two forms of Lewy body disease: Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Tau is a cytoskeletal protein found in neurofibrillary tangles, but not Lewy bodies. The gene encoding tau, MAPT, is a well-established genetic risk factor for LBD; odds ratios of the H1:H2 MAPT haplotypes have been reported in the range of 2 to 4. Despite this genetic association, the mechanism by which tau contributes to dementia is unclear. Recently, a soluble form of tau, Δtau314, which is generated when caspase-2 (Casp2) cleaves tau at Asp314, was reported to be associated with impaired cognition in mice modeling frontotemporal dementia, and with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. To investigate whether Δtau314 is associated with dementia in Lewy body disease, we compared Δtau314 levels in aqueous extracts from the superior temporal gyrus of pathologically confirmed LBD (n = 21) and non-dementia Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 12). We excluded subjects with AD or microvascular pathology, which could mask potential associations of Δtau314 with LBD.Using a Δtau314-specific ELISA, we found ~ 2-fold higher levels of Δtau314 in LBD relative to PD (p = 0.009). Additionally, we found ~40% lower levels of soluble total tau and the neuronal marker β-III-tubulin in LBD. These results suggest that in LBD, there is substantial neuron loss or axonal degeneration in the neocortex but disproportionately high levels of Δtau314 in the surviving neurons.Our results indicate an association between Δtau314 and dementia in Lewy body disease. Cleavage of tau by Casp2 promotes the mislocalization of tau to dendritic spines leading to a reduction in postsynaptic AMPA receptors and excitatory neurotransmission, which suggests a mechanism of the synaptic dysfunction underlying cognitive impairment in LBD. These findings support the potential of Casp2 as a novel drug target for treating LBD.","2019",,"Acta Neuropathol Commun"," To investigate whether Δtau314 is associated with dementia in Lewy body disease , we compared Δtau314 levels in aqueous extracts from the superior temporal gyrus of pathologically confirmed LBD ( n = 21 ) and non-dementia Parkinson's disease ( PD ) ( n = 12 ) ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Caspase 2, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cysteine Endopeptidases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lewy Body Disease, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Male, FALSE, Neurofibrillary Tangles, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, tau Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study on the patient population admitted to the Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli IRCCS Hospital between January 2010 and December 2014 with inclusion of adult patients with at least 2 Na values available and with a normonatremic condition at hospital admission. Patients were categorized according to all Na values recorded during hospital stay in the following groups: normonatremia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, and mixed dysnatremia. The difference between the highest or the lowest Na value reached during hospital stay and the Na value read at hospital admission was used to identify the maximum Na fluctuation. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for in-hospital death in the groups with dysnatremias and across quartiles of Na fluctuation. Covariates assessed were age, sex, highest and lowest Na level, Charlson/Deyo score, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, dementia, congestive heart failure, severe kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and number of Na measurements during hospital stay.
RESULTS: 46,634 admissions matched inclusion criteria. Incident dysnatremia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (hyponatremia: HR 3.11, 95% CI 2.53, 3.84, p < 0.001; hypernatremia: HR 5.12, 95% CI 3.94, 6.65, p < 0.001; mixed-dysnatremia: HR 4.94, 95% CI 3.08, 7.92, p < 0.001).

Transcranial sonography can evaluate global and focal brain atrophy and has been widely used in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism.
METHODS: 225 consecutive PD patients were recruited in a two-center cross sectional study and underwent a standardized sonographic protocol assessing the third ventricle's width and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity. All subjects were evaluated with an extensive motor and cognitive battery.
RESULTS: 222 PD patients were included and classified as PD with normal cognition (PDNC; n = 130), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 61) and dementia (PDD; n = 31). Ventricular width correlated strongly with cognitive performance in all cognitive domains (p < 0.001) while SN size did not. PDD patients had significantly wider ventricles than PD patients without dementia (p < 0.001) while differences between PD-MCI and PDNC or PDD were less strong (p < 0.05). There were no group differences in SN size. ROC analyses resulted in age-related cut-offs of third ventricular diameter for the prediction of PDD (6.0 and 7.5 mm for subjects < and ≥70 years of age, respectively). These cut-offs significantly differentiated PDD from PDNC (p < 0.001) and from all patients without dementia (PDNC + PD-MCI; p < 0.001).

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 268 patients with de novo PD (follow-up > 3 years). According to the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea (CREDOS) WMH visual rating scale scores, the patients were divided into two groups: a PD group with minimal WMH (PD-WMH-; n = 198) and a PD group with moderate to severe WMH (PD-WMH+; n = 70). We compared longitudinal increases in doses of dopaminergic medications between the two groups using a mixed model. We also assessed the effects of WMH on the development of freezing of gait (FOG).
RESULTS: Patients in the PD-WMH + group were older than those in the PD-WMH- group, and had more severe motor deficits and more severely decreased striatal dopamine transporter availability. The PD-WMH + group required higher doses of dopaminergic medications for symptom control, compared to the PD-WMH- group, over the follow-up period. After adjusting for age, sex, striatal dopamine transporter availability, and levodopa-equivalent dose, the PD-WMH + group showed a higher risk of developing FOG (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.79-6.05; p < 0.001) than the PD-WMH- group.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether PVS can independently predict cognitive decline in PD.
METHODS: A total of 271 PD patients were divided into 106 patients with intact cognition (PD-IC) and 165 patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). After a mean follow-up of 5.0 ± 2.3 years, 18 PD-IC patients showed cognitive decline to PD-MCI and 34 PD-MCI patients showed cognitive decline to dementia. PVS was rated in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale using a 4-point visual scale and then classified as high (score ≥ 2) or low (score < 2) according to severity. Lacunes and white matter hyperintensity severity were also assessed. Independent risk factors for cognitive decline were investigated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: In all patients, higher BG-PVS and white matter hyperintensity severity, higher levodopa-equivalent dose, hypertension, and lower Mini-Mental State Examination score were independent positive predictors of future cognitive decline. In the PD-IC subgroup, higher BG-PVS severity, hypertension, and more severe depressive symptoms were predictors of cognitive conversion. In the PD-MCI subgroup, higher BG-PVS and white matter hyperintensity severity, and lower Mini-Mental State Examination score were predictors of cognitive decline.

Olfactory impairment (OI) is a well-established predictive marker of conversion to dementia among those with mild cognitive impairment. This systematic review aims to describe the predictive value of OI for future cognitive decline among cognitively normal adults.
METHODS: A literature search encompassing PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane for longitudinal cohort studies following cognitively normal adults with baseline OI in comparison to those without OI reporting incident cognitive impairment or dementia was included. Study design, participant demographics, olfactory testing method, and incidence of cognitive decline or dementia were abstracted. Two investigators independently reviewed all articles.
RESULTS: The search yielded 964 nonduplicate abstracts and titles, from which 19 full-text articles were reviewed and 10 were included. Studies included were all good quality (mean score 8.7 of 9), and all studies (100%) found a statistically significant association between baseline OI and incident cognitive decline compared with normosmic controls.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal associations of social engagement and cognition in cognitively normal older adults with varying levels of neocortical amyloid-β, the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologic marker.
METHODS: Two hundred seventeen men and women, age 63-89 underwent assessments for social engagement and cognitive performance at baseline and 3 years later using the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors questionnaire and the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). Amyloid-β was measured using Pittsburgh compound B-PET. Multivariable regression models estimated main and interactive effects of baseline social engagement and amyloid-β on cognitive change. Reciprocal models estimated main and interactive effects of baseline cognitive performance and amyloid-β on change in social engagement.
RESULTS: Baseline social engagement was associated with PACC change as a modifier but not as a main effect. Lower baseline social engagement was associated with greater amyloid-β-related PACC decline, while higher baseline social engagement was associated with relative preservation of PACC scores (β = 0.05, p = 0.03). Reciprocally, lower baseline PACC score was associated with decline in social engagement score (β = 1.1, p = 0.02).

Although it is indicated that OH can be a marker of frailty there are no studies that evaluate this relationship in hospitalized patients. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of OH in geriatric ward patients and its association with health and functional ability characteristics and patients' frailty status.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted among patients aged 60 or over hospitalized in the geriatric ward.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients' medical records were analyzed and those with Active Standing Test (AST) results were included in the study.
MEASUREMENTS: Orthostatic hypotension was defined by a drop in blood pressure of at least 20mmHg for systolic blood pressure and at least 10mmHg for diastolic blood pressure within 3minutes of standing up in AST. The database included sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional, functional and cognitive state, comorbidity and medical treatment. Frailty syndrome was diagnosed with Clinical Frailty Scale. Correlations with OH were counted and multivariable logistic regression models were built.
RESULTS: 416 patients were hospitalized in the study period and 353 (84.9%) were included, 78 (22.1%) men and 298 (84.4%) 75+ year-old.

Given the known neurochemical changes in the serotonergic system and their association with symptoms of Parkinson's disease, we hypothesised that carriers of the A53T SNCA mutation might show abnormalities in the serotonergic neurotransmitter system before the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and that this pathology might be associated with measures of Parkinson's burden.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited carriers of the A53T SNCA mutation from specialist Movement Disorders clinics in Athens, Greece, and Salerno, Italy, and a cohort of healthy controls with no personal or family history of neurological or psychiatric disorders from London, UK (recruited via public advertisement) who were age matched to the A53T SNCA carriers. We also recruited one cohort of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (cohort 1) from Movement Disorders clinics in London, UK, and retrieved data on a second cohort of such patients (cohort 2; n=40) who had been scanned with a different scanner. 7-day continuous recording of motor function was used to determine the Parkinson's disease status of the A53T carriers.

INTERPRETATION: The presence of serotonergic pathology in premotor A53T SNCA carriers preceded development of dopaminergic pathology and motor symptoms and was associated with disease burden, highlighting the potential early role of serotonergic pathology in the progression of Parkinson's disease. Our findings provide evidence that molecular imaging of serotonin transporters could be used to visualise premotor pathology of Parkinson's disease in vivo. Future work might establish whether serotonin transporter imaging is suitable as an adjunctive tool for screening and monitoring progression for individuals at risk or patients with Parkinson's disease to complement dopaminergic imaging, or as a marker of Parkinson's burden in clinical trials.

Intraindividual variability of neuropsychological performance is a sensitive marker of cognitive decline in other neurologic populations. However, studies have not examined the longitudinal utility of intraindividual variability in predicting future cognitive impairments among individuals with PD. In the current study, we hypothesized that increased intraindividual variability would predict future cognitive decline independent of traditional neuropsychological markers of cognitive impairment.
METHODS: The sample included 423 newly diagnosed PD patients and 175 healthy controls, who were followed up to 5 years (baseline, first, second, third, fourth, and fifth annual follow-up). Participants underwent tests of learning, memory, processing speed, attention, verbal fluency, and visuospatial functioning. Cognitive status (cognitive intact, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia) was classified based on previously established criteria. Multilevel models were computed to examine the longitudinal relationship between intraindividual variability, cognitive status, and general cognitive functioning.
RESULTS: Analyses revealed that increased intraindividual variability was predictive of incident cognitive decline among individuals with PD. Specifically, greater dispersion in neuropsychological performance was associated with greater risk of transitioning from cognitively intact to mild cognitive impairment or transitioning from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Additional analyses revealed a significant Intraindividual Variability × Group (PD or control) interaction, meaning that intraindividual variability was predictive of declines in cognitive functioning among PD participants only but not healthy controls.

Moreover, subjective memory complaints are recognized as an early marker of cognitive impairment. However, it has been established that subjective memory complaints could also be a reflection of depressive symptoms. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of depressive symptoms and subjective memory complaints on the incidence of cognitive impairment in older adults with high blood pressure.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study, a representative cohort composed by individuals aged ≥ 50 years. Participants with cognitive impairment in 2012 were excluded since the outcome was incident cognitive impairment in 2015. Four groups were created according to depressive symptomatology and subjective memory complaints status, analyses were stratified according to blood pressure status. The odds incident cognitive impairment was estimated through logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 6,327 participants were included, from which 6.44% developed cognitive impairment. No differences were seen regarding the development of cognitive impairment in participants without high blood pressure. However, increased risk was evident in those with both high blood pressure and depressive symptoms (OR=2.1, 95% CI 1.09 - 4.09, p =0.026) as with high blood pressure, depressive symptoms and subjective memory complaints (OR=1.91, 9% CI 1.4 - 3.2, p= 0.001).

METHODS: Within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, we measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific marker of systemic inflammation, at three visits: 21 years and 14 years before, and concurrent with the assessment of depression symptoms, defined using the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale. We categorized participants into one of four groups based on their 21-year longitudinal pattern of elevated (≥3 mg/L) versus low (<3 mg/L) CRP (stable low; unstable low; unstable elevated; stable elevated). Analyses excluded participants with suspected depression during midlife.
RESULTS: A total of 4,614 participants were included (age at CESD assessment: 75.5 [SD: 5.1]; 59% female; follow-up time: 20.7 years [SD: 1.0]). Compared to participants who maintained low CRP levels (stable low), participants who had elevated CRP at two of three visits (unstable elevated; ß = 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.17) and participants who maintained elevated CRP at all three visits (stable elevated; ß = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.21) had greater depression symptoms as older adults, after adjusting for confounders. After excluding participants with late-life cognitive impairment, only participants with stable elevated CRP demonstrated significantly greater late-life depression symptoms.

The disease is a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. The treatment of PD is based on compensation for the brain's supply of DA lost by drug therapy, deep brain stimulation, surgery, gene and cell therapies. Clinical studies have focused on the utility of stem cell-based therapies in PD. Embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used. Recently, human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) have been considered as a suitable source of tissue for this purpose. In this project, hADSCs differentiated into dopaminergic neurons and the specificity of the cell preparations was examined. Human adipose tissues were collected from healthy volunteers undergoing liposuction and hADSCs were isolated by collagenase-based enzymatic method. Flow cytometry was performed using the surface cluster of differentiation (CD) markers to confirm the cell typical properties. Then hADSCs were differentiated to dopaminergic neurons in neurobasal medium in the presence of differentiation factors and confirmed by immunocytochemistry via neuronal and dopaminergic markers. The isolated hADSCs were cultured and identified by the expression of MSCs surface markers including CD90, and CD44. These cells did not express hematopoietic surface markers such as CD45 and CD14. Differentiated cells express neuronal marker NeuN and dopaminergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). It is concluded that hADSCs can be easily taken from the patient's own body and differentiated into dopaminergic cells having a lower risk of transplant rejection.","2019",,"Res Pharm Sci"," Recently , human adipose derived stem cells ( hADSCs ) have been considered as a suitable source of tissue for this purpose ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

DATA SOURCES: We have identified articles from Pubmed, Science Direct, Medline and Scopus databases, with the keywords Alzheimer, Exercise, Neuroimaging, MRI, PET y Physical Activity. Selected articles: We included those studies that evaluated the effects of physical activity on Alzheimer's disease and those which also included magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography with Pittsburg Compound B marker (PiB) analyzing brain atrophy or increase of the beta-amyloid deposit respectively. We excluded studies including other types of dementia, different of AD. We also excluded articles which not included neuroimaging tests, single cases or non-English language articles.

Whether temporal patterns of occurrence reflect different etiologies remain unknown.
METHODS: Participants from the National Health and Aging Trends Study were assessed annually (2011-2016) for frailty (Fried's criteria) and CI (bottom quintile of clock drawing test or immediate and delayed recall; proxy-report of dementia diagnosis or AD8 ≥ 2). We used the Fine & Gray model to identify correlates of frailty onset before CI, CI onset before frailty, and frailty-CI co-occurrence, accounting for death as a competing risk.
RESULTS: Of 3,848 free of frailty, CI, and dementia at baseline, 2,183 (61.2%) developed neither frailty nor CI during the 5-year follow-up; 343 (8.3%) developed frailty first; 1,014 (24.4%) developed CI first; and 308 (6.0%) developed frailty-CI co-occurrence. Incident dementia, as a marker of underlying neuropathologies, was associated with greater likelihood of CI onset first (subdistribution hazard ratios [SHR] = 2.60, 95% confidence interval [ci] 2.09 to 3.24), and frailty-CI co-occurrence (SHR = 8.77, 95% ci 5.79 to 13.28), but lower likelihood of frailty onset first (SHR = 0.38, 95% ci 0.21 to 0.68). Number of comorbidities was only associated with frailty occurrence first (1 comorbidity: SHR = 2.51, 95% ci 1.15 to 5.47; 4+ comorbidities: SHR = 6.48, 95% ci 2.78 to 15.48).
CONCLUSIONS: Different patterns of frailty and CI occurrence exist, and dementia-related pathologies and comorbidities may be important correlates of order of emergence, potentially reflecting different etiologies.

Furthermore, Aβ34 levels correlate with the overall Aβ clearance rates in amyloid positive individuals. Using CSF samples from the PREVENT-AD cohort (cognitively normal individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease), we further demonstrate that the Aβ34/Aβ42 ratio, representing Aβ degradation and cortical deposition, associates with pre-clinical markers of neurodegeneration.

Levels of total and phosphorylated α-synuclein were elevated in enteric and brain neurons in DSS-treated PD mice, suggesting that mild gut inflammation accelerates α-synuclein pathology. Markers of inflammation in the colon and brain, but not in the blood, were elevated in DSS-treated PD mice, consistent with retrograde transneuronal propagation of α-synuclein pathology and neuroinflammation from the gut to the brain.

METHODS: In a longitudinal follow-up study of 63 consecutive iRBD patients (follow-up duration 6.7 ± 3.8 years), the baseline cognitive profile of converters to neurodegenerative disease was compared with that of the nonconverters. Five cognitive domains were assessed: memory, attention-working memory, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, language. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed according to the Movement Disorder Society's diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease.
RESULTS: 30 subjects (47.6%) developed a neurodegenerative disease (latency to conversion 60.33 ± 44.81 months). MCI was found in 50% of the converters and 12% of the nonconverters (p = .001), and its presence conferred a neurodegenerative disease risk of 10% at 3 years, 36% at 5 years, and 73% at 10 years (p = .002). Pathological equivalent scores on at least one neuropsychological test were detected in 46.7% of the converters versus 21.2% of the nonconverters in the memory domain (p = .032), in 40.0% versus 6.1% in that of executive functions (p = .002), and in 20.0% versus 3% in the visuospatial abilities domain (p = .047). On multivariate analysis, impaired executive functions significantly correlated with phenoconversion (p = .018). Lower Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p = .004) and memory deficits (p = .031) were found in patients who developed dementia first.

Outcomes included rates of decline in the Standardized Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (SADAS-cog), Standardized MMSE, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment screen and the Lawton-Brody activities of daily living (ADL) scale.
RESULTS: Half of the patients (196/392) had a ≥4-point decline in the SADAS-cog over one-year. Using this cut-off, there were no statistically significant associations between any measures of VVV, for systolic or diastolic BP, with and without adjustment for potential confounders including treatment allocation, history of hypertension and use of anti-hypertensive and cognitive enhancing medications. Multiple regression models examining the association between systolic BP CV by quartile and decline over one-year likewise showed no clinically significant effects, apart from a U-shaped pattern of ADL decline of borderline clinical significance.∥Conclusions: This observational study does not support recent research showing that VVV predicts cognitive decline in AD.

We undertook a study to determine whether MBI was associated with progressive changes in neuropsychological performance in people without significant cognitive impairment.
METHODS: A total of 9,931 older adults enrolled in the PROTECT study who did not have MCI or dementia undertook a comprehensive neuropsychological battery measuring attention, reasoning, executive function, and working memory at baseline and 1 year. MBI was ascertained using self-administration of the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist at 1 year, and participants were grouped according to MBI status: No Symptoms, Intermediate NPS and MBI. All assessments were completed online, and data analyzed using mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis of covariance.
RESULTS: A total of 949 (10%) people had MBI. These individuals had significantly worse cognitive performance at baseline and significantly greater decline over 1 year in the four composite cognitive scores measuring attentional intensity (F [2,8578] = 3.97; p = 0.019), sustained attention (F [2,8578] = 18.63; p <0.0001), attentional fluctuation (F [2,8578] = 10.13; p <0.0001) and working memory (F [2,9895] = 13.1; p <0.0001).

However, the gradient between education and Alzheimer's disease is presumed to operate through cognitive stimulation. We examined the possible role of status anxiety through testing for state-level income inequality and social gradients in markers of socioeconomic position (SEP) for Alzheimer's disease risk.
METHODS: Using data from the cross-sectional 2015 and 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we tested for the association between U.S. state-level income inequality and individual SEP on subjective cognitive decline (SCD) - a marker of dementia risk - using a generalized estimating equation and clustering by state.
RESULTS: State income inequality was not significantly associated with SCD in our multivariable model (OR 1.2; 95% CI: 0.9, 1.6; p=0.49). We observed a clear linear relationship between household income and SCD where those with an annual household income of 50k to 75k had 1.4 (95% CI: 1.3, 1.6) times the odds and those with household incomes of less than $10,000 had 4.7 (95% CI: 3.8, 5.7) times the odds of SCD compared to those with household income of more than $75,000. We also found that college graduates (ref.) and those who completed high school (OR: 1.1; 95% CI 1.04, 1.2) fared better than those with some college (OR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) or less than a high school degree (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.4, 1.7).

Impairments in the cholinergic-mediated attentional supervision of gait may contribute to increased fall risk, especially when obstacles challenge gait. Interventions combining motor-cognitive approaches have been shown to improve motor performance, cognitive skills, and falls number. Here, we hypothesized that an intervention simulating an attention-demanding walking condition could affect not only complex gait performance and fall risk but also short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), as a marker of cholinergic activity.
METHODS: Thirty-nine participants at falls risk (24 Parkinson's disease participants and 15 older adults) were recruited in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were assigned to treadmill training or treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality intervention and trained three times a week for 6 weeks. SAI, a transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm, was used to assess cholinergic activity. Gait kinematics was measured during usual walking and while negotiating physical obstacles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and gait assessments were performed pre, post, and 6 months post-intervention.
RESULTS: Treadmill training combined with non-immersive virtual reality induced an increase in inhibition of the SAI protocol on cortical excitability, improved obstacle negotiation performance, and induced a reduction of the number of falls compared with treadmill training. Furthermore, the more SAI increased after training, the more the obstacle negotiation performance improved and fall rate decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that an innovative rehabilitation approach targeting cognitive components of complex motor actions can induce changes in cortical cholinergic activity, as indexed by SAI, thereby enabling functional gait improvements.","2020",,"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci",,"randomized controlled trial","Accidental Falls, FALSE, prevention & control, Q000517, Afferent Pathways, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Biomechanical Phenomena, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Exercise Test, FALSE, Exercise Therapy, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Female, FALSE, Gait, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multitasking Behavior, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Risk Factors, FALSE, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, FALSE, Virtual Reality, FALSE, Walking, FALSE, physiology, Q000502",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS AND RESULTS: Associations between VRFs (smoking, hypertension, pulse pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio) and brain structural and diffusion MRI markers were examined in UK Biobank (N = 9722, age range 44-79 years). A larger number of VRFs was associated with greater brain atrophy, lower grey matter volume, and poorer white matter health. Effect sizes were small (brain structural R2 ≤1.8%). Higher aggregate vascular risk was related to multiple regional MRI hallmarks associated with dementia risk: lower frontal and temporal cortical volumes, lower subcortical volumes, higher white matter hyperintensity volumes, and poorer white matter microstructure in association and thalamic pathways. Smoking pack years, hypertension and diabetes showed the most consistent associations across all brain measures. Hypercholesterolaemia was not uniquely associated with any MRI marker.
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of VRFs were associated with poorer brain health across grey and white matter macrostructure and microstructure. Effects are mainly additive, converging upon frontal and temporal cortex, subcortical structures, and specific classes of white matter fibres.

For example, idiopathic hyposmia (IH), which is a reduced olfactory sensitivity, is typical in >95% of PD patients and is a preclinical marker for the pathology.
METHODS: In this work, a wearable inertial device, named SensHand V1, was used to acquire motion data from the upper limbs during the performance of six tasks selected by MDS-UPDRS III. Three groups of people were enrolled, including 30 healthy subjects, 30 IH people, and 30 PD patients. Forty-eight parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis. A feature array was selected as the most significant to discriminate among the different classes both in two-group and three-group classification. Multiple analyses were performed comparing three supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naïve Bayes, on three different datasets.
RESULTS: Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (F-Measure 0.95 for RF and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including subjects with hyposmia as a separate group (0.79 accuracy, 0.80 precision with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, RF classifiers were the best approach for this application.
CONCLUSION: The system is suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) genetic mutations are undoubtedly pathogenic, albeit by unclear mechanisms. Conversely, high dose B-vitamins convincingly slow brain atrophy in a pre-stage state of sporadic AD. Here we suggest a link between sporadic and genetic AD: 1) Increased serum homocysteine, a marker of B-vitamin deficiencies, is a significant risk factor for sporadic AD. It also correlates with elevated levels of antichymotrypsin, a serine protease inhibitor. 2) Family members with codon 717 APP mutations and dementia have low serum vitamin B12 values. Overexpression of the APP domain coding for a Kunitz type serine protease inhibitor might explain this. 3) PSEN1 mutations disrupt lysosomal function due to reduced proteolytic activity. They also trap cobalamin (B12) within lysosomes, leading to intracellular deficiency of the vitamin. In summary, APP and PSEN1 mutations both confer a risk for reduced protease activity and B12 bio-availability. Comparably, sporadic AD features a constellation of increased protease inhibition and B-vitamin deficiencies, the central part of which is believed to be B12. These concordant observations in three disparate AD etiologies suggest a common neuropathogenic pathway.

The S100A9-driven amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade occurring during primary and secondary TBI events can serve as a mechanistic link between TBI and Alzheimer's as demonstrated recently in the human brain tissues. Here by using immunohistochemistry in the controlled cortical impact TBI mouse model we have found pro-inflammatory S100A9 in the brain tissues of all mice on the first and third post-TBI days, while 70% of mice did not show any S100A9 presence on seventh post-TBI day similar to controls. This indicates that defensive mechanisms effectively cleared S100A9 in these mouse brain tissues during post-TBI recovery. By using sequential immunohistochemistry we have shown that S100A9 was produced by both neuronal and microglial cells. However, Aβ peptide deposits characteristic for Alzheimer's disease were not detected in any post-TBI animals. On the first and third post-TBI days S100A9 was found to aggregate intracellularly into amyloid oligomers, similar to what was previously observed in human TBI tissues. Complementary, by using Rayleigh scatting, intrinsic fluorescence and atomic force microscopy we demonstrated that in vitro S100A9 self-assembles into amyloid oligomers within minutes. Its amyloid aggregation is highly dependent on changes of environmental conditions such as variation of calcium levels, pH, temperature and reduction/oxidation, which might be relevant to perturbation of cellular and tissues homeostasis under TBI. Present results demonstrate that S100A9 induction mechanisms in TBI are similar in mice and humans, emphasizing that S100A9 is an important marker of brain injury and therefore can be a potential therapeutic target.","2019",,"Neurosci Lett",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Brain Injuries, Traumatic, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Calgranulin B, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Disease Models, Animal, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Microglia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Plaque, Amyloid, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Protein Aggregation, Pathological, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We theorize that autoimmunity to the central nervous system (CNS) could explain these phenomena and undertook this study to determine whether peripheral inoculation with spinal cord homogenate on 1 or 2 occasions is associated with CNS-directed autoimmunity and neurodegeneration in a rat model.
METHODS: Rats were subcutaneously inoculated with saline or 75 mg of allogeneic spinal cord tissue on 1 or 2 occasions. Animals underwent Morris Water Maze testing, and serial serum samples were collected. Animals were sacrificed 8 weeks following the first inoculation. Autoantibody titers to myelin antigens MAG and GM1 were measured in serum. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify autoantibodies targeting NeuN-labeled neurons and CC1-labeled oligodendrocytes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting were performed for pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the cell death marker caspase 3 as well as the neurodegenerative proteins tau and β-amyloid in both brain and spinal cord. Fluoro-Jade B was used to stain degenerating neurons, facilitating counting.
RESULTS: Animals inoculated with spinal cord homogenate exhibited increased titers of autoantibodies to MAG and GM1 and autoantibodies binding to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Double-inoculated animals demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain (TNF-α, p = 0.016; IL-6, p = 0.009) as well as the spinal cord (TNF-α, p = 0.024; IL-6, p = 0.002). The number of degenerating neurons was significantly increased in the brain and spinal cord of inoculated animals (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.028, respectively). Elevated expression of tau and β-amyloid was seen in brain of double-inoculated animals (p = 0.003 and p = 0.009, respectively). Inflammatory marker expression in the brain was positively correlated with anti-myelin autoimmune antibody titers and with tau expression in the brain. Inoculated animals showed impaired memory function in Morris Water Maze testing (p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these experiments demonstrate that peripheral exposure to spinal cord antigens is associated with CNS-directed autoimmunity and inflammation in the brain and spinal cord as well as degeneration of CNS cells, memory impairment, and production of neurodegenerative proteins particularly when this exposure is repeated. These data support CNS autoimmunity as a candidate mechanism for the dementia that can follow SCI and perhaps other posttraumatic dementias such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy.","2019",,"J Neurosurg"," OBJECTIVE : Recent research demonstrates that victims of spinal cord injury ( SCI ) are at increased risk for dementia and that encephalitis can occur as a consequence of isolated SCI ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Finally, those studies that proposed new possible treatments were reviewed.

It is still debated, however, whether this increased risk results from impaired glucocerebrosidase activity leading to substrate accumulation. Comparing the presence of prodromal PD marker in GBA mutation carriers and patients with Gaucher disease (GD) (in which substrate accumulation is extensive) can assist in clarifying this issue.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we compared the hyperechogenic area of the substantia nigra, a prodromal PD marker, in large cohorts of GBA mutation carriers (n = 71) and patients with GD (n = 145). Our control populations were healthy, non-carriers (n = 49) and patients with GBA -related PD (n = 11). Substrate accumulation was assessed from dry blood spot levels of glucosylsphingosine.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate no contribution of substrate accumulation, as the area of hyperechogenicity is similarly enlarged relative to healthy controls in both GBA mutation carriers and patients with GD. Moreover, this similarity between GBA carriers and patients with GD persists when comparing only carriers of the N370S (c.1226A>G) mutation (n = 38) with untreated patients with GD who were homozygotes for the same mutation (n = 47). In addition, measurements of hyperechogenic area did not correlate with levels of glucosylsphingosine in the untreated patients with GD.
CONCLUSION: The presence of a marker of prodromal PD (substantia nigra hyperechogenicity) is independent of substrate accumulation in a population with mutated GBA . Although further longitudinal studies are needed to determine the precise predictive value of this marker for GBA -related PD, our findings raise doubts regarding the contribution of substance reduction strategies to PD prevention.","2019",,"Eur J Neurol","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Individuals with GBA ( glucocerebrosidase ) mutations are at increased risk of Parkinson's disease ( PD ) ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gaucher Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Glucosylceramidase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Prodromal Symptoms, FALSE, Psychosine, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Ultrasonography, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The present study shows the potential of Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, in bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) induced VaD in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: BCCAo procedure was performed under anesthesia in wistar rats to induce VaD. Morris Water-Maze (MWM) parameter was employed on 7th day post-surgery to determine learning and memory. Escape latency time, time spent in target quadrant, Path length and average swim speed taken as important parameters in MWM. Endothelial dysfunction was assessed in isolated aorta by observing endothelial dependent vasorelaxations and levels of serum nitrite. Various biochemical and histopathological estimations were also performed.
RESULTS: BCCAo produced significant impairment in endothelium dependent vasorelaxation and a decrease in serum nitrite levels indicating endothelial dysfunction. Further poor performance on MWM represents impairment of learning and memory. There was a significant rise in brain oxidative stress level (indicated by increase in brain thiobarbituric acid reactive species and decrease in reduced glutathione levels). Increase in brain acetylcholinesterase activity; brain myloperoxidase activity and brain neutrophil infiltration (as marker of inflammation) were also observed. Treatment of Tadalafil (5 & 10 mg/kg, p. o.)/Donepezil (0. 5 mg/kg, i.p., serving as standard) ameliorated BCCAo induced endothelial dysfunction; memory deficits; biochemical and histopathological changes in a significant manner.

Previous studies use only global measures of general intelligence and/or study this relationship in gender-specific samples. The contribution of early-life performance on specific cognitive abilities, such as language, reasoning, and visualization aptitudes, to indicating future dementia risk is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between adolescent cognitive ability and Medicare-recorded Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD) using both general and specific measures of cognitive ability and to explore these associations separately in men and women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study from the Project Talent-Medicare linked data set, a linkage of adolescent sociobehavioral data collected from high school students in 1960 to participants' 2012 to 2013 Medicare Claims and expenditures data. The association between adolescent cognitive ability and risk of ADRD in later life was assessed in a diverse sample of 43 014 men and 42 749 women aged 66 to 73 years using a series of logistic regressions stratified by sex, accounting for demographic characteristics, adolescent socioeconomic status, and regional effects. Data analysis was conducted from November 2017 to March 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of Medicare-reported ADRD.
RESULTS: Overall, 1239 men (2.9%) and 1416 women (3.3%) developed ADRD. Lower mechanical reasoning was associated with increased odds of ADRD in men (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.29), and lower memory for words in adolescence was associated with increased odds of ADRD in women (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28). Lower performance on several other language, reasoning, visualization, and mathematic aptitudes in adolescence showed prominent, but weaker, associations with odds of ADRD.

,"30630532","Early increase of CSF sTREM2 in Alzheimer's disease is associated with tau related-neurodegeneration but not with amyloid-β pathology.","Suárez-Calvet M","BACKGROUND: TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor that is predominantly expressed by microglia in the central nervous system. Rare variants in the TREM2 gene increase the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) resulting from shedding of the TREM2 ectodomain can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is a surrogate measure of TREM2-mediated microglia function. CSF sTREM2 has been previously reported to increase at different clinical stages of AD, however, alterations in relation to Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) deposition or additional pathological processes in the amyloid cascade (such as tau pathology or neurodegeneration) remain unclear. In the current cross-sectional study, we employed the biomarker-based classification framework recently proposed by the NIA-AA consensus guidelines, in combination with clinical staging, in order to examine the CSF sTREM2 alterations at early asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of AD.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1027 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Imaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, including 43 subjects carrying TREM2 rare genetic variants, was conducted to measure CSF sTREM2 using a previously validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ADNI participants were classified following the A/T/N framework, which we implemented based on the CSF levels of Aβ
RESULTS: CSF sTREM2 differed between TREM2 variants, whereas the p.R47H variant had higher CSF sTREM2, p.L211P had lower CSF sTREM2 than non-carriers. We found that CSF sTREM2 increased in early symptomatic stages of late-onset AD but, unexpectedly, we observed decreased CSF sTREM2 levels at the earliest asymptomatic phase when only abnormal Aβ pathology (A+) but no tau pathology or neurodegeneration (TN-), is present.
CONCLUSIONS: Aβ pathology (A) and tau pathology/neurodegeneration (TN) have differing associations with CSF sTREM2. While tau-related neurodegeneration is associated with an increase in CSF sTREM2, Aβ pathology in the absence of downstream tau-related neurodegeneration is associated with a decrease in CSF sTREM2.","2019",,"Mol Neurodegener",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Biomarkers, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Membrane Glycoproteins, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Receptors, Immunologic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, tau Proteins, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Recent work has demonstrated that such patients without dopaminergic deficit are at a greater risk of cognitive impairment yet have intact olfaction relative to parkinsonian patients with dopaminergic deficit.
OBJECTIVES: Given the high discriminatory power of olfaction assessments in movement disorders, the current study sought to determine whether olfaction dysfunction differentially predicted cognitive decline in patients with or without dopaminergic deficit.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative. The total sample included 401 patients with and 51 patients without dopaminergic deficit, based on neuroimaging scans, and 175 healthy controls. Participants were categorized into non-impaired or impaired olfaction groups based on performance on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test.

RESULTS: Within the impaired olfaction groups, participants without dopaminergic deficit had lower cognitive scores than participants with dopaminergic deficit and healthy controls at baseline. Group differences were not significant at follow-up; rather, impaired baseline olfaction predicted cognitive decline across all study participants.

Those with SAB were more likely to be hospitalized, male, have a recent urinary procedure, have pure S. aureus culture in urine, and have laboratory findings suggesting systemic infection. Patients with isolated SABU were more likely to be ≥65 years, have dementia, and have abnormal urinalyses with pyuria and urine nitrites. In-hospital mortality in patients with SABU and SABU+SAB was 9.2% and 17.5%, respectively. Patients with SABU detected ≥48 hours before SAB had the highest risk of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Less than 7% of patients with SABU have or will develop SAB. Characteristics associated with SABU were identified that established higher risk for systemic infection.

Automated quantification of EPVS would greatly help to advance research into its etiology and its potential as a risk indicator of disease. We propose a convolutional network regression method to quantify the extent of EPVS in the basal ganglia from 3D brain MRI. We first segment the basal ganglia and subsequently apply a 3D convolutional regression network designed for small object detection within this region of interest. The network takes an image as input, and outputs a quantification score of EPVS. The network has significantly more convolution operations than pooling ones and no final activation, allowing it to span the space of real numbers. We validated our approach using a dataset of 2000 brain MRI scans scored visually. Experiments with varying sizes of training and test sets showed that a good performance can be achieved with a training set of only 200 scans. With a training set of 1000 scans, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between our scoring method and the expert's visual score was 0.74. Our method outperforms by a large margin - more than 0.10 - four more conventional automated approaches based on intensities, scale-invariant feature transform, and random forest.

This pre-dementia window provides a unique opportunity for secondary prevention. However, exposing non-demented subjects to putative therapies requires reliable biomarkers for subject selection, stratification, and monitoring of treatment. Neuroimaging allows the detection of early pathological changes, and longitudinal imaging can assess the effect of interventions on markers of molecular pathology and rates of neurodegeneration. This is of particular importance in pre-dementia AD trials, where clinical outcomes have a limited ability to detect treatment effects within the typical time frame of a clinical trial. We review available evidence for the use of neuroimaging in clinical trials in pre-dementia AD. We appraise currently available imaging markers for subject selection, stratification, outcome measures, and safety in the context of such populations.
MAIN BODY: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is a validated in-vivo marker of fibrillar amyloid plaques. It is appropriate for inclusion in trials targeting the amyloid pathway, as well as to monitor treatment target engagement. Amyloid PET, however, has limited ability to stage the disease and does not perform well as a prognostic marker within the time frame of a pre-dementia AD trial. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), providing markers of neurodegeneration, can improve the identification of subjects at risk of imminent decline and hence play a role in subject inclusion. Atrophy rates (either hippocampal or whole brain), which can be reliably derived from structural MRI, are useful in tracking disease progression and have the potential to serve as outcome measures. MRI can also be used to assess comorbid vascular pathology and define homogeneous groups for inclusion or for subject stratification. Finally, MRI also plays an important role in trial safety monitoring, particularly the identification of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Tau PET to measure neurofibrillary tangle burden is currently under development. Evidence to support the use of advanced MRI markers such as resting-state functional MRI, arterial spin labelling, and diffusion tensor imaging in pre-dementia AD is preliminary and requires further validation.

Abnormal intracellular aggregates of misfolded α-synuclein such as LBs and LNs are pathological hallmarks of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). According to previous studies using pathological models overexpressing α-synuclein, high expression of this protein in neurons is a critical risk factor for neurodegeneration. Therefore, it is important to know the endogenous expression levels of α-synuclein in each neuronal cell type. We previously reported differential expression profiles of α-synuclein in vitro and in vivo. In the wild-type mouse brain, particularly in vulnerable regions affected during the progression of idiopathic PD, α-synuclein is highly expressed in neuronal cell bodies of some early PD-affected regions, such as the olfactory bulb, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the substantia nigra pars compacta. Synaptic expression of α-synuclein is mostly accompanied by expression of vesicular glutamate transporter-1, an excitatory synapse marker protein. In contrast, α-synuclein expression in inhibitory synapses differs among brain regions. Recently accumulated evidence indicates the close relationship between differential expression profiles of α-synuclein and selective vulnerability of certain neuronal populations.

The underlying mechanism of that observation is still unknown. Given that severity of cerebral small vessel disease is a predictor of cognitive decline, we aimed to explore whether there is an association between hs-cTnT and severity of white matter lesions (WML) as a marker of cerebral small vessel disease in patients with ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We analyzed consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to Charité-University Hospital, Berlin from 2011 to 2013. Severity of WML was graded on 3T-MRI using the age-related white matter severity score (ARWMS). Patients with hs-cTnT elevation suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were excluded (hs-cTnT > 52 ng/l or dynamic change of hs-cTnT > 50%, ESC guideline). We performed unadjusted and adjusted quantile regression models to assess the association between increased hs-cTnT (dichotomized at the 99th percentile, 14 ng/l) and severity of WML.
RESULTS: A total of 860 patients was analyzed (median age 73 years, 44.8% female, median ARWMS 6). Patients with elevated hs-cTnT had more extensive WML than those without (median ARWMS 8 vs. 5, adjusted beta for 50th percentile 1.12, 95% CI 0.41-1.84). The association between WML and hs-cTnT elevation was strongest in patients with severe WML (adjusted beta 1.77, 95% CI 0.26-3.27 for 80th WML percentile).

This antibody, termed the apoE cleavage fragment p17 (nApoECFp17) antibody specifically detects an amino-terminal 17 kDa fragment of apoE without reacting with full-length forms of the protein. Application of this antibody revealed the presence of this fragment in Lewy bodies in all cases examined. Colocalization of nApoECFp17 with an antibody to alpha-synuclein (α-Syn), which served as a general marker for Lewy bodies, indicated the presence of this apoE fragment in 87.5% of all identified Lewy bodies. In addition, localization of nApoECFp17 was also evident within oligodendrocytes, the nucleus of melatonin-containing neurons, and blood vessels. Conversely, little staining was observed in the substantia nigra from Pick's disease or in the frontal cortex of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) cases, suggesting a specificity for nApoECFp17 immunoreactivity in PD.

It was determined that, in the MCI group, both the N1 and LPC components were significantly different compared to those of the HS group during the execution of the oddball task. In particular, the N1 amplitude, was reduced, while the LPC amplitude was increased, indicating that a degree of perceptive compensation can occur when sensorial function is impaired.

Many previous studies of brain changes underlying cognitive impairment in T2DM have applied conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect macrostructural changes associated with cerebrovascular disease such as white matter hyperintensities or infarcts. However, such pathology likely reflects end-stage manifestations of chronic decrements in cerebral blood flow (CBF). MRI techniques that measure CBF may (1) elucidate mechanisms that precede irreversible parenchymal damage and (2) serve as a marker of risk for cognitive decline. CBF measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI may be a useful marker of perfusion deficits in T2DM and related conditions. We examined associations among T2DM, CBF, and cognition in a sample of 49 well-characterized nondemented older adults. Along with a standard T1-weighted scan, a pseudocontinuous ASL sequence optimized for older adults (by increasing post-labeling delays to allow more time for the blood to reach brain tissue) was obtained on a 3T GE scanner to measure regional CBF in FreeSurfer derived regions of interest. Participants also completed a neuropsychological assessment. Results showed no significant differences between individuals with and without T2DM in terms of cortical thickness or regional brain volume. However, adjusting for age, sex, comorbid vascular risk factors, and reference CBF (postcentral gyrus) older adults with T2DM demonstrated reduced CBF in the hippocampus, and inferior temporal, inferior parietal, and frontal cortices. Lower CBF was associated with poorer memory and executive function/processing speed. When adjusting for diabetes, the significant associations between lower regional CBF and poorer executive function/processing speed remained. Results demonstrate that CBF is reduced in older adults with T2DM, and suggest that CBF alterations likely precede volumetric changes. Notably, relative to nondiabetic control participants, those with T2DM showed lower CBF in predilection sites for AD pathology (medial temporal lobe and inferior parietal regions). Findings augment recent research suggesting that perfusion deficits may underlie cognitive decrements frequently observed among older adults with T2DM.

However, the spatiotemporal pattern of white matter changes preceding dementia symptoms in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, largely due to the inherent diagnostic uncertainty in the preclinical phase and increased risk of confounding age-related vascular disease and stroke in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In early-onset autosomal-dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, participants are destined to develop dementia, which provides the opportunity to assess brain changes years before the onset of symptoms, and in the absence of ageing-related vascular disease. Here, we assessed mean diffusivity alterations in the white matter in 64 mutation carriers compared to 45 non-carrier family non-carriers. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we mapped the interaction of mutation status by estimated years from symptom onset on mean diffusivity. For major atlas-derived fibre tracts, we determined the earliest time point at which abnormal mean diffusivity changes in the mutation carriers were detectable. Lastly, we assessed the association between mean diffusivity and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of amyloid, tau, phosphorylated-tau, and soluble TREM2, i.e. a marker of microglia activity. Results showed a significant interaction of mutations status by estimated years from symptom onset, i.e. a stronger increase of mean diffusivity, within the posterior parietal and medial frontal white matter in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers. The earliest increase of mean diffusivity was observed in the forceps major, forceps minor and long projecting fibres-many connecting default mode network regions-between 5 to 10 years before estimated symptom onset. Higher mean diffusivity in fibre tracts was associated with lower grey matter volume in the tracts' projection zones. Global mean diffusivity was correlated with lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β1-42 but higher levels of tau, phosphorylated-tau and soluble TREM2.

Identification of modifiable risk factors for it is essential. Vascular risk factors (VRFs) may be associated with cognitive decline in early PD. Biomarkers that serve as surrogates of the long-term effect of VRFs on PD are needed. To that end, we aimed to quantitate white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in early PD, measure associations with VRFs and examine relationships between WMH and longitudinal cognition.
METHODS: Participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative study (141 patients with PD, 63 healthy controls) with adequate baseline structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data were included. Hypertension and diabetes history, and body mass index were combined to create a vascular risk score. WMH were quantitated via automated methods. Cognition was assessed annually with a comprehensive test battery.
RESULTS: In the PD group, vascular risk score was associated with WMH for total brain (β = 0.210; P = 0.021), total white matter (β = 0.214; P = 0.013), frontal (β = 0.220; P = 0.002) and temporal (β = 0.212; P = 0.002) regions.

RESULTS: 17.7% Aβ+ and 8.1% Aβ-progressed over 8 years (OR: 2.43). Risk of progression for Aβ+ was 65-104% greater than Aβ-. Aβ+ APOEɛ4 carriers were at 348% greater risk than all other participants. Significant risk factors of progression in Aβ+ were age (HR: 1.05), PET SUVR (HR: 2.49) and APOE ɛ4 carriage (HR: 2.63); only age was a significant risk factor in Aβ-(HR: 1.09). Aβ-progressors were not near the threshold for Aβ+. These relationships were not moderated by hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or stroke/TIA.
CONCLUSION: Aβ+ is an important prognostic marker for progression from CN to MCI/dementia in older adults and APOEɛ4 carriage provides further predictive value in the presence of Aβ+. These data suggest that Aβ-associated clinical progression is consistent with clinical-pathological models of AD, whereas progression in the absence of elevated Aβ deposition may be the result of neuropathological processes other than AD that accumulate with age.","2018",,"J Alzheimers Dis"," OBJECTIVE : To estimate the risk of progression to the symptomatic stages of AD due to PET Aβ + and the extent that progression was influenced by other demographic , genetic , and clinical characteristics in a large prospective study ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Apolipoprotein E4, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Dementia, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Disease Progression, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Positron-Emission Tomography, FALSE, Statistics, Nonparametric, FALSE, Survival Analysis, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The identification of subtle cognitive decline associated with preclinical AD would not only advance understanding of the disease, but also provide clinical targets to assess preventative and early intervention treatments. Disrupted retrieval of detailed episodic autobiographical memories may be a sensitive indicator of subtle cognitive decline, because this type of memory taxes a core neural network affected by preclinical AD neuropathology.
METHODS: To begin to address this idea, we assessed the episodic specificity of autobiographical memories retrieved by cognitively normal middle-aged and older individuals who are carriers of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele - a population at increased risk for subtle cognitive decline related to neuropathological risk factors for AD. We compared the ε4 carriers to non-carriers of ε4 similar in age, education, and gender.
RESULTS: The ε4 carriers did not perform worse than the non-carriers on a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. In contrast, as a group, the ε4 carriers generated autobiographical memories that were reduced in ""internal"" or episodic details relative to non-carriers.

The iterative Bayesian model averaging (BMA) procedure was applied to linear and logistic regression models in order to identify the best set of factors describing cognitive dysfunction and dementia, respectively. According to BMA, there is strong evidence that higher vitamin D levels, higher body mass index (BMI), and higher mobility function measured with the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test are independently associated with better cognitive performance and lower risk of dementia. Additionally, there is strong evidence that fewer years of education and lower vitamin B12 plasma levels independently describe worse cognitive performance.

A significant negative association was found between the DRS and 4MT (Spearman correlation - 0.26, p = 0.0006), but not with the VRSTT. The 4MT was also found to be a better predictor of risk than tests of episodic memory, verbal fluency, or executive functioning.

RESULTS: Results from retrospective longitudinal analyses showed that each biomarker had a univariate association with the global cognitive composite; however, when each marker was analyzed in a single statistical model, only tau was a significant predictor of global cognitive decline. There was an interaction between tau and amyloid such that tau-related cognitive decline was worse in individuals with high amyloid. There was also an interaction with hippocampal volume indicating that individuals with high levels of all 3 pathologies exhibited the greatest declines in cognition. Additional analyses within each cognitive domain indicated that tau had the largest negative influence on tests of episodic memory and executive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that increasing levels of tau most consistently relate to declines in cognition preceding biomarker collection.

Aim of our study was the evaluation of cognitive-driven worsening of ADL by the performance-based Multiple Object Test (MOT), offering an essential clinical advantage as it is quick and easy to apply in a clinical context even on severely impaired patients.
METHODS: 73 PD patients were assessed longitudinally over a period of 37 (6-49) months. According to their neuropsychological profile the sample was divided into two groups: PD patients with (n = 34, PD-CI) and without cognitive impairment (n = 39, PD-noCI). The MOT comprises five routine tasks (e.g. to make coffee) quick and easy to apply. Quantitative (total error number, processing time) and qualitative parameters (error type) were analyzed using non-parametric test statistic (e.g.Wilcoxon signed-rank test, binary logistic regression).
RESULTS: Median number of total errors (p = 0.001), processing time (p<0.001), perplexity (p = 0.035), and omission errors (p<0.001) increased significantly from baseline to follow-up in the total sample. Worsening of MOT performance was correlated to cognitive decline in the attention/ executive function and visuo-constructive domain. PD-CI showed an increase in omission errors (p = 0.027) compared to PD-noCI over time. This increase in omission errors between visits was further identified as a risk marker for PDD conversion.
CONCLUSION: The MOT, especially frequency of omission errors, is a promising tool to rate PD patients objectively and might help to identify patients with a high risk for having mild cognitive impairment or dementia.","2018",,"PLoS One"," Aim of our study was the evaluation of cognitive-driven worsening of ADL by the performance-based Multiple Object Test ( MOT ) , offering an essential clinical advantage as it is quick and easy to apply in a clinical context even on severely impaired patients ","other","Activities of Daily Living, TRUE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cognition, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Disease Progression, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Reproducibility of Results, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In this paper, we critically revise the evidence on the relationship between serum uric acid levels and cognitive function in older individuals, focusing on the etiology of cognitive impairment (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's dementia, and vascular dementia) and on the interactive connections between uric acid, dementia, and diet. Despite high heterogeneity in the existing studies, due to different characteristics of studied populations and methods of cognitive dysfunction assessment, we conclude that serum uric acid may modulate cognitive function in a different way according to the etiology of dementia. Current studies indeed demonstrate that uric acid may exert neuroprotective actions in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's dementia, with hypouricemia representing a risk factor for a quicker disease progression and a possible marker of malnutrition. Conversely, high serum uric acid may negatively influence the disease course in vascular dementia.

Because PD patients primarily suffer from executive dysfunction, we hypothesized that individuals with RBD show an impairment in the nonamnestic executive domain rather than in amnestic domains. To address this question, we investigated a cohort of 1145 healthy elderly (183 with RBD) cross-sectionally and a subgroup of 544 of them longitudinally (144 with RBD) over 6 years. Assessments included the RBD screening questionnaire, the extended Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease test battery, and genetic testing for the risk variant rs356219 in the alpha-synuclein gene. In the cross-sectional analysis, the RBD subgroup showed worse performance in the Trail Making Test (TMT) part B and the delta-TMT_B-A when compared to non-RBD subjects. Longitudinal observation revealed a deterioration of TMT-B and delta-TMT_B-A in RBD subjects, a phenomenon that was not observed in the group of non-RBD subjects. These data argue for an early and progressive deterioration of executive dysfunction associated with RBD. Of the total cohort, 18 developed Parkinsonism including 16 with sporadic PD after a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. Of the sporadic PD cases, 4.4% were from the probable RBD group and 0.8% of the non-RBD group.

Much research is devoted to finding prognostic markers for dementia risk. Studies suggest apathy in older people may be prodromal to dementia and could be a relevant, easily measurable predictor of increased dementia risk. However, evidence is fragmented and methods vary greatly between studies.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the evidence for an association between apathy in dementia-free older individuals and incident dementia.
DATA SOURCES: Two reviewers conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO databases.
STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were (1) prospective cohort studies, (2) in general populations or memory clinic patients without dementia, (3) with clear definitions of apathy and dementia, and (4) reporting on the association between apathy and incident dementia.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were followed. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were pooled crude risk ratios, maximally adjusted reported hazard ratios (HR), and odds ratios (OR) using DerSimonian-Laird random effects models.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study populations ranged from 69.2 to 81.9 years (median, 71.6 years) and the percentage of women ranged from 35% to 70% (median, 53%). After screening 2031 titles and abstracts, 16 studies comprising 7365 participants were included. Apathy status was available for 7299 participants. Studies included populations with subjective cognitive concerns (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 11), cognitive impairment no dementia (n = 1), or mixed cognitive and no cognitive impairment (n = 2). Apathy was present in 1470 of 7299 participants (20.1%). Follow-up ranged from 1.2 to 5.4 years. In studies using validated apathy definitions (n = 12), the combined risk ratio of dementia for patients with apathy was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.32-2.50; I2 = 76%; n = 12), the hazard ratio was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.27-4.51; I2 = 90%; n = 7), and the odds ratio was 17.14 (95% CI, 1.91-154.0; I2 = 60%; n = 2). Subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and individual study results suggested the association between apathy and dementia weakened with increasing follow-up time, age, and cognitive impairment. Meta-regression adjusting for apathy definition and follow-up time explained 95% of heterogeneity in mild cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Apathy was associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of dementia in memory clinic patients. Moderate publication bias may have inflated some of these estimates.

We aimed to test whether frailty status was an independent predictor of short-term mortality and other hospital outcomes in older inpatients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
METHOD: We conducted an observational retrospective study in a large tertiary university hospital between October 2014 and October 2016. Routinely measured patient characteristics included demographics (age and sex), Clinical Frailty Scale, acute illness severity (Emergency Department Modified Early Warning Score), the Charlson Comorbidity Index, discharge specialty, history of dementia, history of depression and the presence of a new cognitive impairment. Outcomes studied were inpatient mortality, death within 30 days of discharge, new institutionalisation, length of stay ≥ 7 days and readmission within 30 days to the same hospital.
RESULTS: There were 393 first admission episodes of idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients aged 75 years or more; 166 (42.2%) were female. The mean age (standard deviation) was 82.8 (5.0) years. The mean Clinical Frailty Scale was 5.9 (1.4) and the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1.3 (1.5). After adjustment for covariates, frailty and acute illness severity were independent predictors of inpatient mortality; odds ratio for severely/very severely frail or terminally ill = 8.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0-63.5, p = 0.045 and odds ratio for acute illness severity: 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.6, p = 0.005).

As the ability to select at-risk persons is considered to be important to assess the efficacy of drugs and as MRI is a widely available imaging technique we have recently developed a reliable segmentation algorithm for the corpus callosum (CC). Callosal atrophy within AD has been hypothesized to reflect both myelin breakdown and Wallerian degeneration.
METHODS: We applied our fully automated segmentation and feature extraction algorithm to two datasets: the OASIS database consisting of 316 healthy controls (HC) and 100 patients affected by either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and a second database that was collected at the Memory Clinic of Hospital Network Antwerp and consists of 181 subjects, including healthy controls, subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), MCI, and ADD. All subjects underwent (among others) neuropsychological testing including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The extracted features were the callosal area (CCA), the circularity (CIR), the corpus callosum index (CCI) and the thickness profile.
RESULTS: CIR and CCI differed significantly between most groups. Furthermore, CIR allowed us to discriminate between SCD and HC with an accuracy of 77%. The more detailed callosal thickness profile provided little added value towards the discrimination of the different AD stages. The largest effect of normal ageing on callosal thickness was found in the frontal callosal midbody.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating changes in corpus callosum morphometry in normal ageing and AD by exploring both summarizing features (CCA, CIR and CCI) and the complete CC thickness profile in two independent cohorts using a completely automated algorithm.

Our goal was to provide a gait assessment protocol to be used for clinical and research purposes.
METHODS: Based on a consensus that identified common evaluations to assess motor-cognitive interactions in community-dwelling older individuals, a protocol on how to evaluate gait in older adults for the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) was developed.
RESULTS: The CCNA gait assessment includes preferred and fast pace gait, and dual-task gait that comprises walking while performing three cognitively demanding tasks: counting backwards by ones, counting backwards by sevens, and naming animals. This gait protocol can be implemented using an electronic-walkway, as well as by using a regular stopwatch. The latter approach provides a simple manner to evaluate quantitative gait performance in clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a standardized gait assessment protocol will help to assess motor-cognitive interactions in aging and neurodegeneration, to compare results across studies, and to feasibly implement and translate gait testing in clinics for detecting impending cognitive and mobility decline.","2018",,"Can Geriatr J"," Our goal was to provide a gait assessment protocol to be used for clinical and research purposes ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Among the associated variants, rs3173615 (encoding p.T185S) is the only coding variant; however, non-coding variants may also contribute to disease risk. It has been reported that the risk haplotype is associated with higher levels of TMEM106B and increased levels of TMEM106B cause cytotoxicity; however, the precise mechanism through which TMEM106B haplotypes contribute to neurodegeneration is unclear.
METHODS: We utilized RNA sequencing data derived from temporal cortex (TCX) and cerebellum (CER) from 312 North American Caucasian subjects neuropathologically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, pathological aging or normal controls to analyze transcriptome signatures associated with the risk (TT) and protective (SS) TMEM106B haplotypes. In cohorts matched for disease phenotype, we used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify differentially expressed genes and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene networks associated with the risk and protective TMEM106B haplotypes.
RESULTS: A total of 110 TCX and 116 CER samples were included in the analyses. When comparing TT to SS carriers, we detected 593 differentially expressed genes in TCX and 7 in CER. Gene co-expression network analyses further showed that in both TCX and CER the SS haplotype was positively correlated with gene networks involved in synaptic transmission, whereas the TT haplotype was positively correlated with gene networks enriched for immune response. Gene expression patterns of 5 cell-type-specific markers revealed significantly reduced expression of the neuronal marker and relative increases in all other cell markers in TT as compared to SS carriers in TCX with a similar but non-significant trend in CER.
CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the common TMEM106B risk and protective haplotypes we identified significant and partly conserved transcriptional differences across TCX and CER and striking changes in cell-type composition, especially in TCX. These findings illustrate the profound effect of TMEM106B haplotypes on brain health and highlight the importance to better understand TMEM106B's function and dysfunction in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.","2018",,"Mol Neurodegener",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Gene Regulatory Networks, FALSE, Haplotypes, FALSE, Heterozygote, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Membrane Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Transcriptome, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Two genes associated with recessive, early-onset PD encode the ubiquitin (Ub) kinase PINK1 and the E3 Ub ligase PRKN/PARK2/Parkin, which together orchestrate a protective mitochondrial quality control (mitoQC) pathway. Upon stress, both enzymes cooperatively identify and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated poly-Ub (p-S65-Ub) chains. This specific label is subsequently recognized by autophagy receptors that further facilitate mitochondrial degradation in lysosomes (mitophagy). Here, we analyzed human post-mortem brain specimens and identified distinct pools of p-S65-Ub-positive structures that partially colocalized with markers of mitochondria, autophagy, lysosomes and/or granulovacuolar degeneration bodies. We further quantified levels and distribution of the 'mitophagy tag' in 2 large cohorts of brain samples from normal aging and Lewy body disease (LBD) cases using unbiased digital pathology. Somatic p-S65-Ub structures independently increased with age and disease in distinct brain regions and enhanced levels in LBD brain were age- and Braak tangle stage-dependent. Additionally, we observed significant correlations of p-S65-Ub with LBs and neurofibrillary tangle levels in disease. The degree of co-existing p-S65-Ub signals and pathological PD hallmarks increased in the pre-mature stage, but decreased in the late stage of LB or tangle aggregation. Altogether, our study provides further evidence for a potential pathogenic overlap among different forms of PD and suggests that p-S65-Ub can serve as a biomarker for mitochondrial damage in aging and disease.

Applying three established neurotoxic regimens of METH: single high dose (1 × 30 mg/kg), multiple lower doses (3 × 5 mg/kg) or (3 × 10 mg/kg), we show that METH primarily damages type I fibers (the thinner ones), and to a much lesser extend types II-IV fibers including sterile axons. The striatal TH terminal partial recovery process, consisting of a progressive regrowth increases in types II, III, and IV fibers, demonstrated by co-localization of GAP-43, a sprouting marker, was observed 3 days post-METH treatment. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of growth-cone-like TH-ir structures, indicative of new terminal generation as well as improvement in motor functions after 3 days. A temporal relationship was observed between decreases in TH-expression and increases in silver staining, a marker of degeneration. Striatal regeneration was associated with an increase in astroglia and decrease in microglia expression, suggesting a possible role for the neuroimmune system in regenerative processes.

METHODS: We studied 2920 men (mean age 76 years) without a history of PD and followed them for 11 years. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) was defined as having an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >10. Objective naps were defined as ≥5 consecutive minutes of inactivity as measured by actigraphy, and napping duration was the accumulated time of naps outside the main sleep period. We used logistic regression to compare PD risk across four groups: no EDS& napping <1 h/day (N = 1739, 59.5%; referent group), EDS& napping <1 h/day (N = 215, 7.4%), no EDS& napping ≥ 1 h/day (N = 819, 28.1%) and EDS& napping ≥ 1 h/day (N = 147, 5.0%).
RESULTS: We identified 106 incident PD cases over 11 years. After multivariable adjustment, men with napping  ≥  1h/day alone were twice as likely [odds ratio (OR) = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-3.08], and men with both EDS and napping  ≥ 1 h/day were almost three times as likely to develop PD (2.52, 1.21-5.27), compared with the referent group.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vascular risk and Aβ burden act additively or synergistically to promote cognitive decline in clinically normal older adults; and, secondarily, to evaluate the unique influence of vascular risk on prospective cognitive decline beyond that of commonly used imaging biomarkers, including Aβ burden, hippocampal volume, fludeoxyglucose F18-labeled (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and white matter hyperintensities, a marker of cerebrovascular disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this longitudinal observational study, we examined clinically normal older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants were required to have baseline imaging data (FDG-PET, Aβ-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging), baseline medical data to quantify vascular risk, and at least 1 follow-up neuropsychological visit. Data collection began in 2010 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed on data collected between 2010 and 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vascular risk was quantified using the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease (FHS-CVD) risk score. We measured Aβ burden with Pittsburgh Compound-B PET. Cognition was measured annually with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Models were corrected for baseline age, sex, years of education, and apolipoprotein E ε4 status.
RESULTS: Of the 223 participants, 130 (58.3%) were women. The mean (SD) age was 73.7 (6.0) years, and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.7 (1.2) years. Faster cognitive decline was associated with both a higher FHS-CVD risk score (β = -0.064; 95% CI, -0.094 to -0.033; P < .001) and higher Aβ burden (β = -0.058; 95% CI, -0.079 to -0.037; P < .001).

However, the reason for this remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between dual-task cost and regional brain volume, focusing on the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and motor and lateral frontal cortices in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Forty older adults with mild cognitive impairment from the ""Gait and Brain Study"" were included in this study. Gait velocity was measured during single-task (ie, walking alone) and dual-task (ie, counting backwards, subtracting serial sevens, and naming animals, in addition to walking) conditions, using an electronic walkway. Regional brain volumes were derived by automated segmentation, using 3T magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Partial rank correlation analyses demonstrated that a smaller volume of the left entorhinal cortex was associated with higher dual-task costs in counting backwards and subtracting serial sevens conditions. Subsequent logistic regression analyses demonstrated that a smaller volume of the left entorhinal cortex was independently associated with higher dual-task cost (slowing down >20% when performing cognitive task) in these two conditions. There were no other significant associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that lower dual-task gait performance is associated with volume reduction in the entorhinal cortex.

Obesity has also been linked to hyperaldosteronism, and this can be modeled in rats by high fat (HF) feeding from weaning. Aldosterone, or activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) causes cerebrovascular injury in lean hypertensive rats. We hypothesized that rats fed a HF diet would show inward middle cerebral artery (MCA) remodeling that could be prevented by MR antagonism. We further proposed that the cerebral artery remodeling would be associated with white mater injury.
METHODS: Three-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a HF diet ± the MR antagonist canrenoic acid (Canr) for 17 weeks. Control rats received normal chow (control NC). MCA structure was assessed by pressure myography.
RESULTS: The MCAs from HF fed rats had smaller lumens and thicker walls when compared to arteries from control NC rats; Canr prevented the MCA remodeling associated with HF feeding. HF feeding increased the mRNA expression of markers of cell proliferation and vascular inflammation in cerebral arteries and Canr treatment prevented this.

We assessed the relationship between blood pressure abnormalities and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), a marker of cerebral small vessel disease, in 128 patients with PD. We examined supine and orthostatic blood pressures and used 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to assess the presence or absence of orthostatic hypotension (OH), supine hypertension (SH), nocturnal hypertension (NH), and loss of nocturnal blood pressure dips (non-dipping). CMBs were found in 13 (10.2%) patients, and the median number of CMBs was 1 (range: 1 to 10). Six of these patients had deep or infratentorial CMBs, six had strictly lobar CMBs, and one had mixed CMBs. Linear regression analysis indicated that presence of both OH and SH was independently associated with greater numbers of CMBs in deep or infratentorial regions, independent of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and white matter hyperintensities. NH and non-dipping were not associated with CMBs in deep or infratentorial regions, and there was no association between blood pressure and CMBs in lobar regions.

Prior research has addressed mortality associated with seniors discharged from the ED with delirium, however has generally relied on data from one or a small number of institutions and at single time points.
OBJECTIVES: Analyse mortality rates among seniors discharged from the ED with delirium up to 12 months at the national level.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Analysed data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services limited data sets for 2012-2013.
PARTICIPANTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older discharged from the ED. We focused on new incident cases of delirium, patients with any prior claims for delirium, hospice claims or end-stage renal disease were excluded. Sample size included 26 245 delirium claims, and a randomly selected sample of 262 450 controls.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality within 12 months after discharge from the ED, excluding patients transferred or admitted as inpatients.
RESULTS: Among all beneficiaries, 46 508 (16.1%) died within 12 months, of which 39 404 (15.0%) were in the non-delirium (ie, control group) and 7104 (27.1%) were in the delirium cohort, respectively. Mortality was strongest at 30 days with an adjusted HR of 4.82 (95% CI 4.60 to 5.04). Over time, delirium was consistently associated with increased mortality risk compared with controls up to 12 months (HR 2.07; 95% CI 2.01 to 2.13). Covariates that affected mortality included older age, comorbidity and presence of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate delirium is a significant marker of mortality among seniors in the ED, and mortality risk is most salient in the first 3 months following an ED visit.

Altered oxysterol levels have been described in patients with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome. Recent studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Thirty-six children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and thirty-eight healthy children, from Sfax (a southern area of Tunisia) matched for age and sex, were included in the study. The severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders was evaluated using the childhood autism rating scale. Standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were measured utilizing standard techniques. Oxysterol levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Standard lipid profile, serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were similar between the two studied populations. Compared to the control group, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders showed a significant higher plasma level of 24-hydroxycholesterol, while borderline significance was observed for 7α-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholersterol. In patients, 24-hydroxycholesterol was inversely correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that high plasma levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are independent risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders. On the other hand, an analysis of the receiver's operating characteristics proved that the measured parameters recorded satisfactory levels of specificity and sensitivity. The present study provides evidence that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with altered levels in circulating oxysterols. The finding that 24-hydroxycholesterol is an independent risk factor for the disease and suggests the use of this oxysterol as a diagnostic tool in Autism Spectrum Disorders.","2018",,"Biochimie"," The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders ","other","Autistic Disorder, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hydroxycholesterols, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Male, FALSE, Oxysterols, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Risk Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The population-based prevalence and outcomes of amyloid positivity in a population without dementia are important for understanding the trajectory of amyloid positivity to clinically significant outcomes and for designing AD prevention trials.
OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence and outcomes of amyloid positivity in a population without dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In the prospective, population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota, participants without dementia were randomly selected from the county population and were clinically and cognitively evaluated at baseline and every 15 months from August 1, 2008, to September 18, 2018. They were also invited to undergo carbon11-Pittburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.
EXPOSURES: Amyloid positivity (defined as a standardized uptake value ratio >1.42 on PET).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of amyloid positivity in the Olmsted County population without dementia and risk of progression from no cognitive impairment (ie, normal cognition for age) to incident amnestic MCI (aMCI) and from MCI or aMCI to incident AD dementia.
RESULTS: Of 3894 participants, 1671 underwent PET imaging and were included in the study; 2198 did not undergo imaging, and 25 were excluded for other reasons. The mean (SD) age of participants was 71.3 (9.8) years; 892 (53.4%) were men, and 179 (10.7%) had prevalent MCI. The prevalence of amyloid positivity without cognitive impairment in the population without dementia increased from 2.7% (95% CI, 0.5% to 4.9%) in persons aged 50 to 59 years to 41.3% (95% CI, 33.4% to 49.2%) in those aged 80 to 89 years at baseline. Prevalence of amyloid-positive MCI in the population without dementia increased from 0% in persons aged 50 to 59 years to 16.4% (95% CI, 10.3% to 22.5%) in those aged 80 to 89 years. The incident aMCI risk increased more than 2-fold in participants without cognitive impairment who were amyloid positive vs those who were amyloid negative (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.52 to 3.35; P < .001). The risk of AD dementia was 1.86 (95% CI, 0.89 to 3.88; P = .10) for amyloid-positive participants with MCI vs amyloid-negative participants with MCI, 1.63 (95% CI, 0.78 to 3.41; P = .20) for participants with aMCI who were amyloid positive vs amyloid negative, and 2.56 (95% CI, 1.35 to 4.88; P = .004) for amyloid-positive participants who were either without cognitive impairment or had aMCI vs those who were amyloid negative. Global cognitive and memory domain z scores declined significantly in amyloid-positive individuals during follow-up. The mean (SD) follow-up time from baseline was 3.7 (1.9) years to incident aMCI and 3.8 (2.0) years to incident AD dementia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: we used data from totals of 13,123, 11,417 and 21,265 respondents aged 50+ at baseline from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), respectively. We performed growth curve analysis to identify cognitive trajectories, and a joint model was used to deal with attrition problems in longitudinal ageing surveys.
RESULTS: respondents with a single sensory impairment had lower episodic memory score than those without sensory impairment in HRS (β = -0.15, P < 0.001), ELSA (β = -0.14, P < 0.001) and SHARE (β = -0.26, P < 0.001). The analysis further shows that older adults with dual sensory impairment in HRS (β = -0.25, P < 0.001), ELSA (β = -0.35, P < 0.001) and SHARE (β = -0.68, P < 0.001) remembered fewer words compared with those with no sensory impairment. The stronger associations between sensory impairment and lower episodic memory levels were found in the joint model which accounted for attrition.

These disturbances may enhance caregivers' risk for chronic conditions of inflammatory pathogenesis. Thus, caregivers' perceived stress and perceived loneliness may form a symptom cluster that can serve as a marker of risks for physical and mental illness.

Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.
METHODS: Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.
RESULTS: Of the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66-0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84-1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I2 = 0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992-1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67-0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported. However, the effect of skull circumference was modified by gender (M vs F ASHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98), but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized with a greater protective effect of larger skull dimensions in men.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life. Leg length is a relatively stable marker of early life nutritional programming, which may confer brain reserve and protect against neurodegeneration in later life through mitigation of cardiometabolic risk. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models for future dementia incidence in the context of secular trends in adult height, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.","2018",,"PLoS One",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Anthropometry, FALSE, China, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Cultural Characteristics, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Frail Elderly, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Latin America, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Leg, FALSE, anatomy & histology, Q000033, Male, FALSE, Proportional Hazards Models, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Regression Analysis, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Skull, FALSE, anatomy & histology, Q000033, Social Class, FALSE, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

As physical inactivity has been identified to be a strong modifiable risk factor for dementia, exercise and physical activity (PA) may be important parameters to predict the progression from MCI to dementia, but might also represent disease trajectory modifying strategies for SCI and MCI.
OBJECTIVE: A better understanding of the relationship between activity, fitness, and cognitive function across the spectrum of MCI and SCI would provide an insight into the potential utility of PA and fitness as early markers, and treatment targets to prevent cognitive decline.
METHODS: 121 participants were stratified into three groups, late MCI (LMCI), early MCI (EMCI), and SCI based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitive function assessments also included the Trail Making Test A+B, and a verbal fluency test. PA levels were evaluated with an interviewer-administered questionnaire (LAPAQ) and an activity monitor. An incremental exercise test was performed to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness and to determine exercise capacity relative to population normative data.
RESULTS: ANCOVA revealed that LMCI subjects had the lowest PA levels (LAPAQ, p = 0.018; activity monitor, p = 0.041), and the lowest exercise capacity in relation to normative values (p = 0.041). Moreover, a modest correlation between MoCA and cardiorespiratory fitness (r = 0.25; p < 0.05) was found.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate gender- and age-specific associations of olfactory function and cognitive performance in a well characterized population-based study sample.
METHODS: At the third examination of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study (n = 3,087), 2,640 participants (48% men; 68.2±7.2 years) underwent Sniffin' Sticks Screening Test measuring olfactory function on a scale of 0-12 points. Olfactory function was rated as anosmic, hyposmic, or normosmic (≤6, 7-10 or ≥11 points, respectively). All participants performed eight validated cognitive subtests. Age- (55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-86 years) and gender-stratified multivariate analysis of covariance was used to evaluate group differences in cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Women showed better olfactory function than men (p < 0.001). For middle-aged participants, olfactory groups differed in almost all cognitive subtests. The analyses revealed no gender effects, although associations were slightly greater for women than for men. Anosmics showed the worst cognitive performance and normosmics showed the best cognitive performance.

OBJECTIVES: This prospective study determined the prevalence of HAND at a peri-urban HIV clinic in KwaZulu-Natal. Factors associated with HAND were examined, alternate neurocognitive tools were tested against the international HIV dementia scale (IHDS) score and an association between HAND and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) was explored.
METHODS: Between May 2014 and May 2015, 146 ART-naïve outpatients were assessed for HAND. IHDS score ≤ 10 established a diagnosis of HAND. Functional capacity was assessed using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score. Chi-squared test was used to identify risk factors for HAND. The get-up-and-go test (GUGT) and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale - revised (CESD-r) were tested against the IHDS. HIV viral load done six months after initiating ART was used as a surrogate marker for adherence to ART.
RESULTS: The prevalence of HAND was 53%. In total, 99.9% of patients with HAND had no functional impairment. Age > 50 years old was associated with HAND (
CONCLUSIONS: While the prevalence of HAND is high, it is not associated with functional impairment which suggests that asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment is prevalent.

Genetic variants in SORL1 have been identified in patients with AD, but a possible role in other dementias is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether common polymorphisms in SORL1 affect the risk of developing dementia in a population-based cohort of patients with incident PD.
METHODS: One common, nonsynonymous SORL1 variant (rs2298813; A528T) was identified in whole exome sequencing data from 185 patients with PD from the Norwegian ParkWest study, who had been followed up to the 7-year visit after diagnosis. A528T was tested for association with PD risk, the development of dementia, and in a subset of patients (n = 103) for associations with established AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers measured at the time of PD diagnosis.
RESULTS: We found an association of A528T carrier status with increased risk of developing PD dementia (HR 2.31; 95% CI 1.09-4.90; p = 0.03) compared to non-carriers. Additionally, A528T carrier status was associated with a reduced ratio of CSF β-amyloid 42 to p-Tau (p = 0.014) but no alterations in absolute AD marker levels (all p > 0.05) at the time of PD diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Our results show the first association of the AD risk factor SORL1 with incident dementia in PD, providing new evidence that AD related disease mechanisms may contribute to dementia in a subset of patients with PD.

Since few studies have characterized how these risk factors affect everyday functioning, we investigated the relationship between APOE ɛ4 genotype and elevated pulse pressure (PP) on functional change in cognitively normal participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
METHODS: 738 normally aging participants underwent APOE genotyping, and baseline PP was calculated from blood pressure indices. The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) was completed by participants' informant at baseline and 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48-month follow-up visits. Multiple linear regression and multilevel modeling were used to examine the effects of PP and APOE ɛ4 genotype on cross-sectional and longitudinal FAQ scores, respectively.
RESULTS: Adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, results showed that both APOE ɛ4 status and elevated PP predicted greater functional difficulty trajectories across four years of follow-up. Interestingly, however, elevated PP was associated with greater functional decline over time in ɛ4 non-carriers versus carriers.
CONCLUSION: Results show that, although APOE ɛ4 status is the prominent predictor of functional difficulty for ɛ4 carriers, an effect of arterial stiffening on functional difficulty was observed in non-carriers. Future studies are needed in order to clarify the etiology of the association between PP and different brain aging processes, and further explore its utility as a marker of dementia risk. The present study underscores the importance of targeting modifiable risk factors such as elevated PP to prevent or slow functional decline and pathological brain aging.","2018",,"J Alzheimers Dis","BACKGROUND / OBJECTIVE : The APOE ɛ4 allele and increased vascular risk have both been independently linked to cognitive impairment and dementia ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Apolipoprotein E4, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Blood Pressure, TRUE, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Heterozygote, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Vascular Stiffness, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Independent variables consisted of a range of demographic, psychiatric, and disease-specific markers.
RESULTS: In the most parsimonious model of persistent anxiety, higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, a history of anxiety, fewer years of education, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, lower Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores, female sex, and complications of therapy (higher Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part IV scores) were all associated with more severe persistent anxiety. Markers associated with more severe episodic anxiety included PD-specific disturbances of activities of daily living, complications of therapy, higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, female sex, and a history of anxiety. Finally, higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, a history of anxiety, complications of therapy, and longer disease duration were associated with avoidance behavior. After excluding clinically depressed patients with PD, disease severity and longer disease duration were significantly associated with episodic anxiety, but not with persistent anxiety.

Thirty-one participants at risk for ADAD (age 39 ± 13 years, 19 females) were recruited into this study, and 21 of them received both MRI and FDG and PiB PET scans. Considerable variability was observed in regional correlations between ASL-CBF and FDG across subjects. Both regional hypo-perfusion and hypo-metabolism were associated with amyloid deposition. Cross-sectional analyses of each biomarker as a function of the estimated years to expected dementia diagnosis indicated an inverse relationship of both perfusion and glucose metabolism with amyloid deposition during AD development.

Hallucinations are associated with cognitive impairment and typically involve perception of complex objects. Changes in object perception may therefore be a sensitive marker of visuo-perceptual deficits in PD.
OBJECTIVE: We developed an online platform to test visuo-perceptual function. We hypothesised that (1) visuo-perceptual deficits in PD could be detected using online tests, (2) object perception would be preferentially affected, and (3) these deficits would be caused by changes in perception rather than response bias.
METHODS: We assessed 91 people with PD and 275 controls. Performance was compared using classical frequentist statistics. We then fitted a hierarchical Bayesian signal detection theory model to a subset of tasks.
RESULTS: People with PD were worse than controls at object recognition, showing no deficits in other visuo-perceptual tests. Specifically, they were worse at identifying skewed images (P < .0001); at detecting hidden objects (P = .0039); at identifying objects in peripheral vision (P < .0001); and at detecting biological motion (P = .0065). In contrast, people with PD were not worse at mental rotation or subjective size perception. Using signal detection modelling, we found this effect was driven by change in perceptual sensitivity rather than response bias.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia strongly linked to synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that SNCA variants conferring risk of Parkinson's disease would also predispose to an RBD phenotype.
METHODS: We assessed possible RBD (pRBD) status using the RBD screening questionnaire and investigated known susceptibility variants for Parkinson's disease located in the α-synuclein (SNCA) and tau (MAPT) gene loci in 325 Parkinson's disease patients. Associations between genetic risk variants and RBD were investigated by logistic regression, and an independent dataset of 382 patients from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) study was used for replication.
RESULTS: pRBD was associated with rs3756063 located in the 5' region of SNCA (two-sided p = 0.018, odds ratio 1.44). We replicated this finding in the PPMI dataset (one-sided p = 0.036, odds ratio 1.35) and meta-analyzed the results (two-sided p = 0.0032, odds ratio 1.40). The Parkinson's disease risk variant in the 3' region of SNCA and the MAPT variant showed no association with pRBD.

METHODS: We performed metabolomic analysis in the CSF of patients with AD and iNPH with capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. We assessed metabolites to discriminate between AD and iNPH with Welch's 
RESULTS: We found significant increased levels of glycerate and N-acetylneuraminate and significant decreased levels of serine and 2-hydroxybutyrate in the CSF of patients with AD compared to the CSF of patients with iNPH.

CONCLUSIONS: The dopamine reuptake transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography results correlated with motor and nonmotor features of prediagnostic PD, supporting its potential use as a marker in the prodromal phase of PD.

DESIGN: Review.
SETTING: Observational and interventional studies addressing the role of cognition on falls.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (65 years and older).
MEASUREMENTS: The relationship between gait and cognition in aging and neurodegeneration was reviewed in the medical literature to highlight the role of brain motor control deficits in fall risk. The benefits of dual-task gait assessments as a marker of fall risk were reviewed. Therapeutic approaches for reducing falls by improving certain aspects of cognition were appraised.
RESULTS: Low performance in attention and executive function are associated with gait slowing, instability, and future falls. Drug-enhancement of cognition may reduce falls in Parkinson's disease, and cognitive training, dual-task training, and virtual reality modalities are promising to improve mobility in sedentary older adults and in those with cognitive impairment and dementia.
CONCLUSION: Falls remain common in older people, with higher prevalence and morbidity in those who are cognitively impaired. Disentangling the mechanism and contribution of cognitive deficits in fall risk may open new treatment approaches.

WMH can be a manifestation of small vessel disease, although the total microvascular contribution to multifactorial WMH pathophysiology remains unknown. We hypothesized a possible relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), an ultrasound imaging marker of subclinical vascular disease, and brain WMH in a multiethnic, elderly stroke-free community-based cohort.
METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between cIMT and WMH in the population-based Northern Manhattan Study, among individuals free of stroke. We used linear regression to examine the association of continuous measures of cIMT with quantitatively derived WMH volume, as a proportion of cranial volume, measured from fluid-attenuaded inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging while adjusting for sociodemographics, lifestyle, and vascular risk factors.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 1229 participants (mean age, 71±9 years; 60% women, 15% White; 18% Black; 65% Hispanics), the mean cIMT was 0.71±0.08 mm and the median log-transformed WMH volume was 0.36 (interquartile range, 0.21-0.76). In a multivariable model, larger cIMT was significantly associated with greater WMH volume (β=0.046 per SD cIMT;

However, younger individuals (under 65 years) are less-studied in this respect. Also, the relationship between frailty and cause-specific mortality in community settings is understudied. We used a 42-item Rockwood-based frailty index (FI) in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (n=1477; 623 men, 854 women; aged 29-95 years) and analyzed its association with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in up to 30-years of follow-up. Deaths due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, dementia and other causes were considered as competing risks. The FI was independently associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality in younger (<65 years; HR per increase in one deficit 1.11, 95%CI 1.07-1.17) and older (≥65 years; HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.04-1.10) women and in younger men (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.01-1.10). In cause-specific mortality analysis, the FI was strongly predictive of CVD mortality in women (HR per increase in one deficit 1.13, 95%CI 1.09-1.17), whereas in men the risk was restricted to deaths from other causes (HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.01-1.13).

,"29198499","Markers of impaired motor and cognitive volition in Parkinson's disease: Correlates of dopamine dysregulation syndrome, impulse control disorder, and dyskinesias.","Hinkle JT","INTRODUCTION: Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be associated with both motoric (e.g., dyskinesias) and neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Examples of the latter include Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS) and impulse control disorder (ICD), which are separate but related behavioral/psychiatric complications of treatment in PD. Dysregulation of volition characterizes both dyskinesias and DDS/ICD; thus, we analyzed potential disease-related correlates in a large PD cohort.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 654 participants collected through the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program. DDS/ICD symptoms and dyskinesias were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society (revised) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Potential associated variables were selected from PD-validated or PD-specific scales of neuropsychiatric or motoric status. Multivariable models with DDS/ICD or dyskinesia presence outcomes were produced with backward stepwise regression to identify factors independently associated with DDS/ICD and/or dyskinesias.
RESULTS: Fifty-three (8.1%) participants endorsed DDS and/or ICD symptoms and 150 (22.9%) were dyskinetic. In multivariable analysis, psychosis was independently associated with both dyskinesias (p = 0.006) and DDS/ICD (p < 0.001). Unpredictable motor fluctuations (p = 0.026) and depression (p = 0.023) were also associated with DDS/ICD; female sex (p = 0.025), low tremor score (p = 0.001) and high akinesia-rigidity score (p < 0.001) were associated with dyskinesias.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that psychosis may be an important marker of impaired volition across motor and cognitive domains. Unpredictable motor fluctuations, psychosis, and depression may together comprise a phenotypic profile of patients at increased risk for DDS/ICD. Similarly, dyskinetic PD patients should be closely monitored for psychotic symptoms and treated appropriately.","2018",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Biomarkers, TRUE, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Dyskinesias, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Logistic Models, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, FALSE, Psychotic Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Severity of Illness Index, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

While hyperhomocysteinemia induces microhemorrhages and cognitive decline in mice, the specific effect of hyperhomocysteinemia on each cell type remains unknown. We took separate cultures of astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and neuronal cells and treated each with moderate levels of homocysteine for 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr. We then determined the gene expression changes for cell-specific markers and neuroinflammatory markers including the matrix metalloproteinase 9 system. Astrocytes had decreased levels of several astrocytic end feet genes, such as aquaporin 4 and an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel at 72 hr, as well as an increase in matrix metalloproteinase 9 at 48 hr. Gene changes in microglia indicated a peak in proinflammatory markers at 48 hr followed by a peak in the anti-inflammatory marker, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, at 72 hr. Endothelial cells had reduced occludin expression at 72 hr, while kinases and phosphatases known to alter tau phosphorylation states were increased in neuronal cells. This suggests that hyperhomocysteinemia induces early proinflammatory changes in microglia and astrocytic changes relevant to their interaction with the vasculature.

In CN and MCI individuals, we found that amyloid and total tau positivity systematically varies as a function of PHS. For individuals in greater than the 50th percentile PHS, the positive predictive value for amyloid approached 100%; for individuals in less than the 25th percentile PHS, the negative predictive value for total tau approached 85%. High PHS individuals with amyloid and tau pathology showed the steepest longitudinal cognitive and clinical decline, even among APOE ε4 noncarriers. Among the CN subgroup, we similarly found that PHS was strongly associated with amyloid positivity and the combination of PHS and biomarker status significantly predicted longitudinal clinical progression. In the ROSMAP cohort, higher PHS was associated with higher post-mortem amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles, even in APOE ε4 noncarriers. Together, our results show that even after accounting for APOE ε4 effects, PHS may be useful in MCI and preclinical AD therapeutic trials to enrich for biomarker-positive individuals at highest risk for short-term clinical progression.","2018",,"Acta Neuropathol",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Amyloid, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Biomarkers, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multifactorial Inheritance, FALSE, Neurofibrillary Tangles, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Positron-Emission Tomography, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Survival Analysis, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: A single-center, prospective, cohort study with 2 years of radiological follow-up was performed in consecutive patients with different SVD manifestations. The study group consisted of 123 patients: 49 with lacunar stroke (LS), 48 with vascular dementia (VaD) and 26 with vascular parkinsonism (VaP). We assessed SVD progression by a visual SVD scale. We determined the relationship between serum or plasma concentrations of tissue factor (TF), thrombomodulin, beta-thromboglobulin (BTG), fibrinogen, D-dimer and total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides and SVD progression by logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: 34.9% patients had SVD radiological progression: 43% had isolated WMLs progression, 23.2% had new lacunes, 34.8% had both WMLs progression and new lacunes. Fibrinogen [OR 1.02 (95% CI 1.006-1.011] was significantly associated with risk of new lacunes or WMLs progression regardless of the clinical SVD manifestation.

The model started with cognitive status characterized by the ADAS-13 score. Hippocampus volume (HV), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau (pTau), and the FDG t-sum score in an AD meta-region-of-interest were compared as neurodegeneration markers. CSF-Aβ1-42 was used as amyloidosis marker. The incremental prognostic benefit from these markers was assessed by stepwise Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in 402 ADNI MCI subjects. Predefined cutoffs were used to dichotomize patients as 'negative' or 'positive' for AD characteristic alteration with respect to each marker. Among the neurodegeneration markers, CSF-pTau provided the best incremental risk stratification when added to ADAS-13. FDG PET outperformed HV only in MCI subjects with relatively preserved cognition. Adding CSF-Aβ provided further risk stratification in pTau-positive subjects, independent of their cognitive status. Stepwise integration of biomarkers allows stepwise refinement of risk estimates for MCI-to-ADD progression.

However, the role of α-Klotho in the brain has not been sufficiently investigated.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the association between α-Klotho and cognitive decline that is associated with cerebral deep white matter lesions (DWMLs).
METHODS: Two hundred-eighty participants (187 males and 93 females, mean age: 70.8 years old) were evaluated for DWMLs, and the Fazekas scale (Grade) was assessed following brain magnetic resonance imaging. A questionnaire concerning lifestyle and neuropsychological tests was administered, and their associations with the blood α-Klotho level were retrospectively investigated.
RESULTS: The α-Klotho level was 685.1 pg/mL in Grade 0 (68 subjects), 634.1 in G1 (134), 596.0 in G2 (62), and 571.6 in G3 (16), showing that the level significantly decreased with advanced grades. Significant correlations were noted between the α-Klotho level and higher brain function tests including the Mini-Mental State Examination and word fluency tests (p < 0.05). When a 90th percentile value of the level in the G0 group (400 pg/mL) or lower was defined as a low α-Klotho level, the odds ratio of the high-grade G3 group was 2.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-7.8) (after correction for age, sex, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease), which was significant.

METHODS: This study included 1,440 (758 women, mean age 69 ± 6 years) Framingham Offspring participants who were free of dementia and attended 5 consecutive examinations at 4-year intervals starting at midlife (1983-1987, mean age 55 years) until late life (1998-2001, mean 69 years) and subsequently were followed up for incident dementia (mean 8 years). We determined the effect of midlife hypertension (≥140/90 mm Hg), late life hypertension, lower late life blood pressure (<100/70 mm Hg), persistence of hypertension during mid- to late life, and steep decline in blood pressure from mid- to late life over an 18-year exposure period.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 107 participants (71 women) developed dementia. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we found that midlife systolic hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.35) and persistence of systolic hypertension into late life (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.25-3.09) were associated with an elevated risk of incident dementia.

CONCLUSIONS: Elevated blood pressure during midlife, persistence of elevated blood pressure into late life, and, among nonhypertensives, a steep decline in blood pressure during mid- to late life were associated with an increased dementia risk in a community-based cohort.

,"29106439","Increased diastolic blood pressure is associated with MRI biomarkers of dementia-related brain pathology in normative ageing.","McNeil CJ","BACKGROUND: hypertension is a risk for brain ageing, but the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected biomarkers of brain ageing include white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), a marker of cerebrovascular disease, and hippocampal volume, a marker of Alzheimer's disease pathology.
OBJECTIVE: to examine relationships between blood pressure (BP) components and brain pathology in older adults.
SUBJECTS: two hundred and twenty-seven members of the Aberdeen 1936 Birth Cohort between ages 64 and 68 years.
METHODS: BP was assessed biennially between 64 and 68 years and brain MRI performed at 68 years. The risk factors of interest were diastolic and systolic BP and their visit-to-visit variability. Outcomes were WMH abundance and hippocampal volume. Regression models, controlling for confounding factors, examined their relationships.
RESULTS: higher diastolic BP predicted increased WMH (β = 0.13, P = 0.044) and smaller hippocampi (β = -0.25, P = 0.006). In contrast, increased systolic BP predicted larger hippocampi (β = 0.22, P = 0.013). Variability of diastolic BP predicted lower hippocampal volume (β = -0.15, P = 0.033). These relationships were independent of confounding life-course risk factors. Anti-hypertensive medication did not modify these relationships, but was independently associated with increased WMH (β = 0.17, P = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: increased diastolic BP is associated with biomarkers of both cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's diseases, whereas the role of systolic BP is less clear, with evidence for a protective effect on hippocampal volume. These differing relationships emphasise the importance of considering individual BP components with regard to brain ageing and pathology. Interventions targeting diastolic hypertension and its chronic variability may provide new strategies able to slow the accumulation of these harmful pathologies.","2018",,"Age Ageing"," OBJECTIVE : to examine relationships between blood pressure ( BP ) components and brain pathology in older adults ","other","Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Blood Pressure, TRUE, Cerebrovascular Disorders, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Diastole, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Hippocampus, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Humans, FALSE, Hypertension, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Leukoencephalopathies, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Scotland, FALSE, White Matter, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at major risk to develop Alzheimer' Disease (AD) an impairment of subtle visuomotor or praxic abilities is a well-known clinical feature. Enhance of the ratio of EEG alpha3/alpha2 frequency power was detected in subjects with MCI who will transform in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We explored of the association of alpha3/alpha2 power ratio with cortical size of IPL in patients with MCI. 74 subjects with MCI undergone EEG recording and MRI scans. Alpha3/alpha2 power ratio in addition to cortical size had been computed for each patient. Three MCI groups had been acquired in keeping with growing tertile values of alpha3/alpha2 ratio. Huge difference of cortical thickness among the groups was calculated.

However, there are few data concerning the relationship between objectively quantified sleep disruption and the cardinal histopathological features of PD, especially in individuals without clinical PD.
METHODS: We studied 269 older adults without PD who had participated in the Rush Memory and Aging Project and undergone uniform structured neuropathologic evaluations upon death. Sleep fragmentation was measured using actigraphy. Logistic regression models examined the associations of sleep fragmentation proximate to death with the burden of Lewy body pathology and substantia nigra neuron loss.
RESULTS: Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with the presence of Lewy body pathology (odds ratio 1.40; 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.86; P = .02) and substantia nigra neuron loss (odds ratio 1.43; 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.88; P = .008) and a higher odds of a pathological diagnosis of PD (odds ratio 2.04; 95% confidence interval 1.34-3.16; P = .0009). These associations were independent of motor features of parkinsonism, demographic characteristics, and a wide range of medical co-morbidities.

The latter is often associated with atrophy of the medial temporal lobe. However, it is not clear whether hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy is the sole predictor of long-term post-stroke dementia. We hypothesized that hippocampal deformation (rather than atrophy) is a predictive marker of long-term post-stroke dementia on a rat model and tested this hypothesis in a prospective cohort of stroke patients.Male Wistar rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and assessed 6 months later. Ninety initially dementia-free patients having suffered a first-ever ischemic stroke were prospectively included in a clinical study. In the rat model, significant impairments in hippocampus-dependent memories were observed. MRI studies did not reveal significant atrophy of the hippocampus volume, but significant deformations were indeed observed-particularly on the ipsilateral side. There, the neuronal surface area was significantly lower in ischemic rats and was associated with a lower tissue density and a markedly thinner entorhinal cortex. At 6 months post-stroke, 49 of the 90 patients displayed cognitive impairment (males 55.10%). Shape analysis revealed marked deformations of their left hippocampus, a significantly lower entorhinal cortex surface area, and a wider rhinal sulcus but no hippocampal atrophy. Hence, hippocampal deformations and entorhinal cortex atrophy were associated with long-term impaired cognitive abilities in a stroke rat model and in stroke patients. When combined with existing biomarkers, these markers might constitute sensitive new tools for the early prediction of post-stroke dementia.","2018",,"Transl Stroke Res",,"clinical trial","Aged, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Behavior, Animal, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Biomarkers, FALSE, Brain Ischemia, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Entorhinal Cortex, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Female, FALSE, Hippocampus, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Humans, FALSE, Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Wistar, FALSE, Stroke, FALSE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Experimental studies using animal models of AD have highlighted a number of functions associated with TREM2 and its expression by microglial cells. It has therefore been assumed that this is also the case in humans. However, there is very limited information concerning the cellular expression of TREM2 in the human brain. As part of investigations of microglia using post-mortem resources provided by the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (MRC-CFAS), we immunostained the cerebral cortex of 299 participants for TREM2 using the Sigma antibody HPA010917 and compared with the macrophage/microglial markers Iba1 and CD68. As expected, Iba1 and CD68 labeled microglia and perivascular macrophages. However, in most cases (284/299), the TREM2 antibody labelled monocytes within vascular lumens, but not microglia or perivascular macrophages. In contrast, in 5 out of 6 cases with acute infarcts, TREM2 immunoreaction identified cells within the brain parenchyma interpreted as recruited monocytes. Six cases with old infarcts contained phagocytic foamy macrophages which were CD68-positive but TREM2 negative. Our observations, using the HPA010917 anti-TREM2 antibody, suggest that TREM2 is not expressed by microglia but instead seems to be a marker of recruited monocytes in the human brain. This finding has implications with regards to the role of TREM2 as a risk factor, emphasizing the importance of systemic immune responses in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.","2018",,"Brain Pathol",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Antigens, CD, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Brain Infarction, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Calcium-Binding Proteins, FALSE, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cohort Studies, FALSE, DNA-Binding Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Dementia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Immunohistochemistry, FALSE, Macrophages, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Male, FALSE, Membrane Glycoproteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Microfilament Proteins, FALSE, Microglia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Monocytes, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Receptors, Immunologic, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Spleen, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

However, it remains under-explored whether plasma Aβ levels including novel Aβ1-38 relate to vascular brain disease and cognition in a preclinical-phase of dementiaObjective:To examine the association of plasma Aβ levels (i.e., Aβ1-38, Aβ1-40, and Aβ1-42) with markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and cognition in a large population-based setting.
METHODS: We analyzed plasma Aβ1 levels in 1201 subjects from two independent cohorts of the Rotterdam Study. Markers of SVD [lacunes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume] were assessed on brain MRI (1.5T). Cognition was assessed by a detailed neuropsychological battery. In each cohort, the association of Aβ levels with SVD and cognition was performed using regression models. Estimates were then pooled across cohorts using inverse variance meta-analysis with fixed effects.
RESULTS: Higher levels of plasma Aβ1-38, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, and Aβ1-40/ Aβ1-42 ratio were associated with increasing lacunar and microbleeds counts. Moreover, higher levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-40/ Aβ1-42 were significantly associated with larger WMH volumes. With regard to cognition, a higher level of Aβ1-38 Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-40/ Aβ1-42 was related to worse performance on cognitive test specifically in memory domain.

All-cause readmission is the only metric in current use, and risk factors for surgical readmission and those resulting in return to theater (RTT) are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patient-related predictors of all-cause, surgical, and RTT readmission after THA differ and which predictors are most significant.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of all primary THAs recorded in the National Health Service (NHS) Hospital Episode Statistics database from 2006 to 2015. The effect of patient-related factors on 30-day readmission risk was evaluated by multilevel logistic regression analysis. The analysis comprised all acute NHS hospitals in England and all patients receiving primary THA.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thirty-day readmission rate for all-cause, surgical (defined using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision primary admission diagnoses), and readmissions resulting in RTT.
RESULTS: Across all hospitals, 514 455 procedures were recorded. Seventy-nine percent of patients were older than 60 years, 40.3% were men, and 59.7% were women. There were 30 489 all-cause readmissions (5.9%), 16 499 surgical readmissions (3.2%), and 4286 RTT readmissions (0.8%); 54.1% of readmissions were for surgical causes. Comorbidities with the highest odds ratios (ORs) of RTT included those likely to affect patient behavior: drug abuse (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.34-3.67; P = .002), psychoses (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.16-2.87; P = .009), dementia (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11-2.22; P = .01), and depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.31-1.76; P < .001). Obesity had a strong independent association with RTT (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 4.45-6.43; P < .001), with one of the highest population attributable fractions of the comorbidities (3.4%). Return to theater in the index episode was associated with a significantly increased risk of RTT readmission (OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 4.45-6.43; P < .001). Emergency readmission to the hospital in the preceding 12 months increased the risk of readmission significantly, with the association being most pronounced for all-cause readmission (for >2 emergency readmissions, OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 2.11-2.57; P < .001). Hip resurfacing was associated with a lower risk of RTT when compared with cemented implants (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.88; P = .002) but for other types of readmission, implant type had no significant association with readmission risk. Increasing age and length of stay were strongly associated with all-cause readmission.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many patient-related risk factors for surgical and RTT readmission differ from those for all-cause readmission despite the latter being the only measure in widespread use.

METHODS: In the prospective St George's Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke study, multimodal MRI was performed annually for 3 years and cognitive assessments annually for 5 years in a cohort of 99 patients with SVD, defined as symptomatic lacunar stroke and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Progression to dementia was determined in all patients. Progression of WMH, brain volume, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and a DTI measure (the normalized peak height of the mean diffusivity histogram distribution) as a marker of white matter microstructural damage were determined.
RESULTS: Over 5 years of follow-up, 18 patients (18.2%) progressed to dementia. A significant change in all MRI markers, representing deterioration, was observed. The presence of new lacunes, and rate of increase in white matter microstructural damage on DTI, correlated with both decline in executive function and global functioning. Growth of WMH and deterioration of white matter microstructure on DTI predicted progression to dementia. A model including change in MRI variables together with their baseline values correctly classified progression to dementia with a C statistic of 0.85.

Antioxidant treatment was done with Tempol (1 mmol/l) administered in the drinking water during 2 weeks.
RESULTS: The current study revealed that arterial stiffness increases the levels of the microglial markers ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and cluster of differentiation 68 in hippocampus, and of the astrocyte marker, s100 calcium binding protein β in hippocampus and frontal cortex. The cerebral inflammatory effects of arterial stiffness were specific to the brain and not due to systemic inflammation. Treatment with Tempol prevented the increase in superoxide anion in mice with carotid stiffness and attenuated the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus. To determine whether the increased oxidative stress derives from NADPH oxidase, superoxide anion production was assessed by incubating brain tissue in the presence of gp91ds-tat, a selective NADPH oxidase 2 inhibitor. This peptide inhibited superoxide anion production to a greater extent in the brains of mice with carotid calcification compared with controls.
CONCLUSION: Carotid calcification leads to cerebral gliosis mediated by oxidative stress.

The extent to which IIVRT is an independent predictor of mortality, however, is unclear. This study investigated the association of IIVRT and all-cause mortality while accounting for cognitive level, incident dementia and biomedical risk factors in 861 participants aged 70-90 from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. Participants completed two computerised reaction time (RT) tasks (76 trials in total) at baseline, and comprehensive medical and neuropsychological assessments every 2 years. Composite RT measures were derived from the two tasks-the mean RT and the IIVRT measure computed from the intraindividual standard deviation of the RTs (with age and time-on-task effects partialled out). Consensus dementia diagnoses were made by an expert panel of clinicians using clinical criteria, and mortality data were obtained from a state registry. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the association of IIVRT and mean RT with survival time over 8 years during which 191 (22.2%) participants died. Greater IIVRT but not mean RT significantly predicted survival time after adjusting for age, sex, global cognition score, cardiovascular risk index and apolipoprotein ɛ4 status.

The numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes from peripheral blood were determined by immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis and the percentages of these CD+ T cells were calculated. The ratio of regulatory T (Treg)/helper T 17 (Th17) lymphocytes from 64 PD patients and 46 controls was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that the percentage of NK cells was higher in advanced PD patients than in controls (22.92% ± 10.08% versus 19.76% ± 10.09%, P = 0.006), while CD3+ T cells are decreased (62.93% ± 9.27% versus 65.75% ± 9.13%, P = 0.005).

Patients with rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder (RBD) can develop synucleinopathies, and such risk is higher with dopamine transporter single photon emission tomography (123I-FP-CIT SPECT) evidence of nigro-striatal dysfunction. We aimed at evaluating SN 7T magnetic resonance imaging (7T-MRI) in patients with RBD and determining the agreement between MRI and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with idiopathic RBD confirmed by polysomnography and a recent 123I-FP-CIT SPECT underwent a 7T MR by using three-dimensional gradient-recalled-echo multiecho susceptibility-weighted imaging of the SN; the findings were randomly presented with those of 14 HS and 28 patients with PD and blindly evaluated by an expert neuroradiologist, according to recently published criteria. MRI and SPECT results were also compared.
RESULTS: Nine subjects with RBD had abnormal SPECT; among them, the findings of 7T-MRI were rated abnormal in eight. Out of six subjects with RBD with normal SPECT, the 7T-MRI findings of five were rated normal. The Cohen's kappa statistic value of agreement was 0.722.
CONCLUSION: Gradient-recalled-echo multiecho susceptibility-weighted imaging of the SN at 7T is abnormal in 60% of patients with RBD. The 7T-MRI and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT results showed good agreement. 7T-MRI of the SN could represent a safe marker for neurodegenerative disease in patients with RBD, however longitudinal study is warranted.","2017",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord"," We aimed at evaluating SN 7T magnetic resonance imaging ( 7T-MRI ) in patients with RBD and determining the agreement between MRI and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Polysomnography, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, FALSE, Tropanes, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In contrast, expression of genes for the stem cell marker glial fibrillary acidic protein delta and the neuronal progenitor marker eomesodermin was unchanged with age. These data are consistent with a persistence of the hippocampal stem cell population with age. Age-associated expression of the proliferation and immature neuron markers MKI67 and DCX, respectively, was unrelated, suggesting that neurogenesis-associated processes are independently altered at these points in the development from stem cell to neuron.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether L-PVSs are associated with the progression of the established MRI markers of SVD, cognitive decline, and increased risk of dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The prospective, population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study assessed L-PVSs at baseline (September 1, 2002, through February 28, 2006) on MRI studies of the brain in 2612 participants. Participants returned for additional MRI from April 1, 2007, through September 30, 2011, and underwent neuropsychological testing at the 2 time points a mean (SD) of 5.2 (0.2) years apart. Data analysis was conducted from August 1, 2016, to May 4, 2017.
EXPOSURES: The presence, number, and location of L-PVSs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident subcortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and progression of white matter hyperintensities detected on MRI; cognitive decline defined as composite score changes between baseline and follow-up in the domains of memory, information processing speed, and executive function; and adjudicated incident dementia cases diagnosed according to international guidelines.
RESULTS: Of the 2612 study patients (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [4.8] years; 1542 [59.0%] female), 424 had L-PVSs and 2188 did not. The prevalence of L-PVSs was 16.2% (median number of L-PVSs, 1; range, 1-17). After adjusting for age, sex, and interval between baseline and follow-up scanning, the presence of L-PVSs was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident subcortical infarcts (adjusted risk ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.76-3.68) and microbleeds (adjusted risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18-1.72) and a greater 5-year progression of white matter hyperintensity volume. The presence of L-PVSs was also associated with a steeper decline in information processing speed and more than quadrupled the risk of vascular dementia.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The present analyses included 458 participants who were enrolled in a population-based cohort study between October 2008 and June 2013. All included participants had available plasma total tau levels, Aβ positron emission tomography imaging, and a complete neuropsychological examine at the same visit, as well as at least 1 follow-up visit.
EXPOSURES: Concentration of plasma total tau.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of MCI and dementia; global and domain-specific cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Of the 458 participants, 287 (62.7%) were men; mean (SD) age was 80.6 (5.6) years. Among cognitively normal (CN) participants oversampled for elevated brain Aβ, both the middle (hazard ratio [HR], 2.43; 95% CI, 1.25-4.72) and highest (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.01-4.06) tertiles of plasma total tau level, compared with the lowest, were associated with an increased risk of MCI. Among participants with MCI, higher plasma total tau levels were not significantly associated with risk of dementia (all-cause dementia or Alzheimer disease). Among all participants, higher levels of plasma total tau, examined as a continuous variable, were associated with significant (P < .05) declines in global cognition, memory, attention, and visuospatial ability over a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range, 1.1-4.9 years). In additional analyses restricting the follow-up to 15 months, plasma total tau did not predict decline among CN participants. However, among participants with MCI, higher plasma total tau levels were associated with greater decline in both visuospatial ability (regression coefficient [b] = -0.50 [0.15], P < .001) and global cognition (b = -0.27 [0.10], P = .009) at 15 months. Adjusting for elevated brain Aβ did not attenuate any association. There was no interaction between plasma total tau level and brain Aβ for prognosis with any outcome.

We hypothesized that atherosclerosis of the descending aorta (DAo) could be a risk marker for brain aging and injury.
METHODS: We evaluated 1527 participants (mean age 59.9 years, 53.5% women) in the Framingham Offspring cohort who underwent both aortic and brain MRI. Participants were free of clinical stroke, dementia, or other neurological illness at the time of axial MRI of the thoracic and abdominal DAo and subsequent brain MRI. We related the prevalence and burden of aortic plaque to total cerebral brain volume (TCBV) and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV). An additional analysis compared incidence of stroke or TIA in participants with and without DAo plaques.
RESULTS: Presence of thoracic DAo plaque (8%) was associated with decreased TCBV in sex-pooled analysis (-0.77, SE 0.25, p = 0.002, equivalent to 4.5 years of aging) and with increased WMHV only in men (0.26, SE 0.12, p = 0.032, equivalent to 6.5 years aging).

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic regulation is one of the major mechanisms for an organism to respond to the environment through changes in gene expression and has been implicated in numerous disease processes. We would like to examine epigenetic modification patterns that may predispose or protect against PD.
METHODS: Frozen tissue samples of the human cerebral cortex from 12 PD patients and 12 subjects without PD pathology were obtained. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Differential methylation was defined as a mean methylation level difference (delta β) of at least 0.20 (Δβ ≥ 0.20). Methylation regions with an absolute delta β value ≥ 0.20 were selected for further gene function studies.
RESULTS: We identified 2795 differentially methylated CpG sites in the frontal cortex of PD cases with a detection

Our objective is to understand the manner in which socioeconomic disadvantage shapes dementia risk by examining its associations with midlife cognitive performance and cognitive decline from midlife to old age, including cognitive decline trajectories in those with dementia.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data are drawn from the Whitehall II study (N = 10,308 at study recruitment in 1985), with cognitive function assessed at 4 waves (1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012). Sociodemographic, behavioural, and cardiometabolic risk factors from 1985 and chronic conditions until the end of follow-up in 2015 (N dementia/total = 320/9,938) allowed the use of inverse probability weighting to take into account data missing because of loss to follow-up between the study recruitment in 1985 and the introduction of cognitive tests to the study in 1997. Generalized estimating equations and Cox regression were used to assess associations of socioeconomic markers (height, education, and midlife occupation categorized as low, intermediate, and high to represent hierarchy in the socioeconomic marker) with cognitive performance, cognitive decline, and dementia (N dementia/total = 195/7,499). In those with dementia, we examined whether retrospective trajectories of cognitive decline (backward timescale) over 18 years prior to diagnosis differed as a function of socioeconomic markers. Socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with poorer cognitive performance (all p < 0.001). Using point estimates for the effect of age, the differences between the high and low socioeconomic groups corresponded to an age effect of 4, 15, and 26 years, for height, education, and midlife occupation, respectively. There was no evidence of faster cognitive decline in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Low occupation, but not height or education, was associated with risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-3.36]) in an analysis adjusted for sociodemographic factors; the excess risk was unchanged after adjustment for cognitive decline but was completely attenuated after adjustment for cognitive performance. In further analyses restricted to those with dementia, retrospective cognitive trajectories over 18 years prior to dementia diagnosis showed faster cognitive decline in the high education (p = 0.006) and occupation (p = 0.001) groups such that large differences in cognitive performance in midlife were attenuated at dementia diagnosis. A major limitation of our study is the use of electronic health records rather than comprehensive dementia ascertainment.

Less is known about how CBF and Aβ may interact to affect cognition in cognitively normal older adults. Therefore, we examined potential statistical interactions between CBF and Aβ status in regions typically affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) within a sample of older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Sixty-two cognitively normal participants (mean age = 72 years) underwent neuroimaging and memory testing. Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify CBF and florbetapir PET amyloid imaging was used to measure Aβ deposition. Aβ status (i.e., positivity versus negativity) was determined based on established cutoffs (Landau et al., 2013). The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was used to assess memory. Linear regression models adjusted for age, education, and sex, demonstrated significant interactions between CBF and Aβ status on memory performance. Among Aβ positive older adults, there were significant negative associations between higher CBF in hippocampus, posterior cingulate, and precuneus and poorer memory performance. In contrast, among Aβ negative older adults, there were no significant associations between CBF and cognition. Our findings extend previous CBF studies of dementia risk by reporting interactions between Aβ status and CBF on memory performance in a sample of well-characterized, cognitively normal older adults. Results suggest that differential CBF-cognition associations can be identified in healthy, asymptomatic Aβ positive older adults relative to Aβ negative individuals. Associations between higherCBF and poorer memory among Aβ positive older adults may reflect a cellular and/or vascular compensatory response to pathologic processes whereby higher CBF is needed to maintain normal memory abilities.

Animals were sacrificed at different time points following 6-OHDA injection and brain sections containing striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) underwent immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (dopaminergic marker), immunofluorescence for IBA1 and GFAP (markers of microglia and astrocyte activation, respectively) and triple immunoflorescent to identify polarization of microglia toward the cytotoxic M1 (DAPI/IBA1/TNFα) or cytoprotective M2 (DAPI/IBA1/CD206) phenotype. SNc damage induced by 6-OHDA was significantly higher in OVX mice, as compared to all other experimental groups, at 7 and 14 days after surgery. Astrocyte activation was higher in OVX mice with respect the other experimental groups, at all time points. Microglial activation in the SNc was detected at earlier time points in male, female and OVX+E, while in OVX mice was detected at all time-points. Microglia polarization toward the M2, but not the M1, phenotype was detected in female and OVX+E mice, while the M1 phenotype was observed only in male and OVX mice.

In prospective trials, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) reduced the risk of AD and PD, as well as cardiovascular events and many late-onset cancers. Considering the role played by protein hyperphosphorylation in aggregation and neurodegenerative diseases, and aspirin's known ability to donate acetyl groups, we asked whether aspirin might reduce both phosphorylation and aggregation by acetylating protein targets.
RESULTS: Aspirin was substantially more effective than salicylate in reducing or delaying aggregation in human neuroblastoma cells grown in vitro, and in Caenorhabditis elegans models of human neurodegenerative diseases in vivo. Aspirin acetylates many proteins, while reducing phosphorylation, suggesting that acetylation may oppose phosphorylation. Surprisingly, acetylated proteins were largely excluded from compact aggregates. Molecular-dynamic simulations indicate that acetylation of amyloid peptide energetically disfavors its association into dimers and octamers, and oligomers that do form are less compact and stable than those comprising unacetylated peptides.
INNOVATION: Hyperphosphorylation predisposes certain proteins to aggregate (e.g., tau, α-synuclein, and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 [TDP-43]), and it is a critical pathogenic marker in both cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. We present novel evidence that acetylated proteins are underrepresented in protein aggregates, and that aggregation varies inversely with acetylation propensity after diverse genetic and pharmacologic interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that aspirin inhibits protein aggregation and the ensuing toxicity of aggregates through its acetyl-donating activity.

These criteria require a testing of their reliability in different prospective cohorts.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the MDS prodromal PD criteria in 2 independent prospective studies.
METHODS: Prodromal PD probabilities of the Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration cohort (TREND study, n = 650, recruited by the presence of probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression, and/or hyposmia or none of these at baseline and 2-, 4-, and 6-year follow-up) and the population-based Prospective Evaluation of Risk Factors for Idiopathic Parkinson's Syndrome cohort (PRIPS Tübingen subsample; n = 715, baseline and 3- and 5-year follow-up) were calculated. Baseline posttest probabilities, time to PD diagnosis, marker constellations, and longitudinal changes of prodromal PD probabilities were analyzed.
RESULTS: Incident PD cases (TREND, n = 10; PRIPS = 7) showed significantly higher likelihood ratios of risk and prodromal markers at baseline when compared with nonconverters. Only 2 of 17 incident PD cases met the criteria for probable prodromal PD (ie, posttest probability > 80%) and 5 had possible prodromal PD (ie, > 50%) 1.4 to 3.8 years before diagnosis. The criteria showed high specificity and negative predictive values (>98%), but low sensitivity (TREND, 30%; PRIPS, 14%) and positive predictive values (TREND, 19%, PRIPS, 50%). The individual risk for prodromal PD in incident PD cases showed an inverse correlation with the time to conversion (Spearman rho = .80, P = .006) and unlike in nonconverters, increased during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The MDS prodromal criteria provide a practical framework for the calculation of prodromal PD risk.

A dual-task gait test evaluating the cognitive-motor interface may predict dementia progression in older adults with MCI.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a dual-task gait test is associated with incident dementia in MCI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Gait and Brain Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults that enrolled 112 older adults with MCI. Participants were followed up for 6 years, with biannual visits including neurologic, cognitive, and gait assessments. Data were collected from July 2007 to March 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia was the main outcome measure, and single- and dual-task gait velocity and dual-task gait costs were the independent variables. A neuropsychological test battery was used to assess cognition. Gait velocity was recorded under single-task and 3 separate dual-task conditions using an electronic walkway. Dual-task gait cost was defined as the percentage change between single- and dual-task gait velocities: ([single-task gait velocity - dual-task gait velocity]/ single-task gait velocity) × 100. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between risk of progression to dementia and the independent variables, adjusted for age, sex, education, comorbidities, and cognition.
RESULTS: Among 112 study participants with MCI, mean (SD) age was 76.6 (6.9) years, 55 were women (49.1%), and 27 progressed to dementia (24.1%), with an incidence rate of 121 per 1000 person-years. Slow single-task gait velocity (<0.8 m/second) was not associated with progression to dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 3.41; 95% CI, 0.99-11.71; P = .05)while high dual-task gait cost while counting backward (HR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.57-9.15; P = .003) and naming animals (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.04-5.59; P = .04) were associated with dementia progression (incidence rate, 155 per 1000 person-years). The models remained robust after adjusting by baseline cognition except for dual-task gait cost when dichotomized.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dual-task gait is associated with progression to dementia in patients with MCI. Dual-task gait testing is easy to administer and may be used by clinicians to decide further biomarker testing, preventive strategies, and follow-up planning in patients with MCI.

We sought to delineate the baseline clinical characteristics of RBD and evaluate risk stratification models.
METHODS: Clinical assessments were performed in 171 RBD, 296 control, and 119 untreated Parkinson's (PD) participants. Putative risk measures were assessed as predictors of prodromal neurodegeneration, and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) criteria for prodromal PD were applied. Participants were screened for common leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) gene mutations.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, participants with RBD had higher rates of solvent exposure, head injury, smoking, obesity, and antidepressant use. GBA mutations were more common in RBD, but no LRRK2 mutations were found. RBD participants performed significantly worse than controls on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III, timed ""get-up-and-go"", Flamingo test, Sniffin Sticks, and cognitive tests and had worse measures of constipation, quality of life (QOL), and orthostatic hypotension. For all these measures except UPDRS-III, RBD and PD participants were equally impaired. Depression, anxiety, and apathy were worse in RBD compared to PD participants.

Cross-sectional research suggests that IIV increases with normal and neuropathological ageing and it may serve as a marker of neurobiological integrity. This raises the possibility that IIV may also predict future cognitive decline and, indeed, neuropathology. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to address these issues.
METHODS: A search of electronic databases Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was completed on May 17, 2016 that identified longitudinal investigations of IIV in middle-aged or older adults.
RESULTS: A total of 688 studies were initially identified of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Nine included longitudinal IIV measures and 17 predicted subsequent outcome (cognitive decline or impairment, dementia, mortality) from baseline IIV. The results suggested IIV increased over time, particularly in participants aged over 75 years. Greater baseline IIV was consistently associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including cognitive decline or impairment, and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased IIV over time is associated with normal ageing. However, further increases in IIV over and above those found in normal ageing may be a risk factor for future cognitive impairment or mortality. Measures of IIV may, therefore, have considerable potential as a supplement to existing clinical assessment to aid identification of individuals at risk of adverse outcomes such as dementia or death.

We sought to determine the relation between serum inflammatory markers and risk of cognitive decline among adults with CKD.
METHODS: We studied 757 adults aged ≥55 years with CKD participating in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Cognitive study. We measured interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and fibrinogen in baseline plasma samples. We assessed cognitive function at regular intervals in 4 domains and defined incident impairment as a follow-up score more than 1 SD poorer than the group mean.
RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 64.3 ± 5.6 years, and the mean follow-up was 6.2 ± 2.5 years. At baseline, higher levels of each inflammatory marker were associated with poorer age-adjusted performance. In analyses adjusted for baseline cognition, demographics, comorbid conditions, and kidney function, participants in the highest tertile of hs-CRP, the highest tertile of fibrinogen, and the highest tertile of IL-1β had an increased risk of impairment in attention compared to participants in the lowest tertile of each marker. Participants in the highest versus lowest tertile of TNF-α had a lower adjusted risk of impairment in executive function. There was no association between other inflammatory markers and change in cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Among adults with CKD, higher levels of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, and IL-1β were associated with a higher risk of impairment in attention. Higher levels of TNF-α were associated with a lower risk of impaired executive function.","2017",,"Kidney Int Rep"," We sought to determine the relation between serum inflammatory markers and risk of cognitive decline among adults with CKD ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Although associations between chronic hypertension and cognitive function are thought to be mediated primarily by these end organ effects, there is increasing evidence that early changes in cardiac structure and function, such as LVH, may independently contribute to cognitive decline and impairment. In the current issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Mahinrad and colleagues report important new findings on the association between LVH and cognitive function that are incremental to cardiovascular risk and co-morbidity, including hypertension. Emerging evidence that early changes in cardiac structure and function may independently contribute to cognitive decline in elderly populations has resulted in an increased interest in these preclinical substrates as potential treatment targets for the prevention of cognitive decline and in their putative contributions to the pathogenesis of dementia.","2017",,"J Alzheimers Dis",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cardiovascular Diseases, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Cognition Disorders, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Dementia, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mental Status Schedule, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) have been associated with PD, but at present, no data is available about RBD. The 3'UTR hosts regulatory regions involved in gene expression control, such as microRNA binding sites. The aim of this study was to determine RBD specific genetic features associated to an increased risk of progression to PD, by sequencing of the SNCA-3'UTR in patients with ""idiopathic"" RBD (iRBD) and in patients with PD. We recruited 113 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of iRBD (56 patients) or PD (with or without RBD, 57 patients). Sequencing of SNCA-3'UTR was performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples. Bioinformatic analyses were carried out to predict the potential effect of the identified genetic variants on microRNA binding. We found three SNCA-3'UTR SNPs (rs356165, rs3857053, rs1045722) to be more frequent in PD patients than in iRBD patients (p = 0.014, 0.008, and 0.008, respectively). Four new or previously reported but not annotated specific genetic variants (KP876057, KP876056, NM_000345.3:c*860T>A, NM_000345.3:c*2320A>T) have been observed in the RBD population. The in silico approach highlighted that these variants could affect microRNA-mediated gene expression control.

Study design and rationale of the Diabetes and Dementia (D2) study.","Patel SK","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and there is a strong association between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. However, we do not know which type 2 diabetes patients will dement or which biomarkers predict cognitive decline. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is potentially such a marker. LVH is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes and is a strong, independent predictor of cardiovascular events. To date, no studies have investigated the association between LVH and cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes and Dementia (D2) study is designed to establish whether patients with type 2 diabetes and LVH have increased rates of brain atrophy and cognitive decline.
METHODS: The D2 study is a single centre, observational, longitudinal case control study that will follow 168 adult patients aged >50 years with type 2 diabetes: 50% with LVH (case) and 50% without LVH (control). It will assess change in cardiovascular risk, brain imaging and neuropsychological testing between two time-points, baseline (0 months) and 24 months. The primary outcome is brain volume change at 24 months. The co-primary outcome is the presence of cognitive decline at 24 months. The secondary outcome is change in left ventricular mass associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline at 24 months.
DISCUSSION: The D2 study will test the hypothesis that patients with type 2 diabetes and LVH will exhibit greater brain atrophy than those without LVH. An understanding of whether LVH contributes to cognitive decline, and in which patients, will allow us to identify patients at particular risk.

Moreover, multiple studies have assessed the value of colonic α-synuclein as a potential marker of prodromal PD. Recently, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) defined research criteria for prodromal PD.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to test the MDS research criteria in patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopies as potential candidates for inclusion in prospective trials evaluating colonic biopsies as a potential biomarker of prodromal PD.
METHODS: We evaluated elderly patients without manifest parkinsonism undergoing diagnostic colonoscopies. During the study we assessed all risks and prodromal markers of the MDS research criteria, excluding radiotracer imaging and genetic testing.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 100 enrolled patients was 61.6±9.7 years; 42 were men. The most common prodromal marker in our cohort was constipation (40%), followed by MDS-UPDRS part III scores of >6 points, excluding action tremor items (39%) and hyposmia (37%). Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity was identified in 9%, and polysomnography confirmed REM sleep behavior disorder in 2% of the patients. Five of the 100 enrolled patients (5%) fulfilled the criteria for probable prodromal PD, while another 3 patients met the 50% probability threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest, that the prevalence of prodromal PD in patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopies may be higher compared to the general elderly population, although this should be confirmed in further studies including also matched controls not undergoing colonoscopy. The real prevalence of prodromal PD in this cohort will have to be confirmed in longitudinal follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that long-term exposure to lower orthostatic blood pressure is related to having worse CS later in life and that atrophy of regions involved in central regulation of autonomic function mediate these associations.
METHODS: Three-to-four measures of orthostatic blood pressure were obtained from 1997-2003 in a longitudinal cohort of aging, and average systolic orthostatic blood pressure response (ASOBPR) was computed as % change in systolic blood pressure from sit-to-stand measured at one minute post stand. CS was determined in 2010-2012 by clinician-adjudication (n = 240; age = 87.1±2.6; 59% women; 37% black) with a subsample also undergoing concurrent structural neuroimaging (n = 129). Gray matter volume of regions related to autonomic function was measured. Multinomial regression was used to compare ASOBPR in those who were cognitively intact versus those with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, controlling for demographics, trajectories of seated blood pressure, incident cardiovascular risk/events and medications measured from 1997 to 2012. Models were repeated in the subsample with neuroimaging, before and after adjustment for regional gray matter volume.
RESULTS: There was an inverse association between ASOBPR and probability of dementia diagnosis (9% lower probability for each % point higher ASOBPR: OR 0.91, CI95%  = 0.85-0.98; p = 0.01).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate mid-regional proADM (MR-proADM), a stable fragment of the ADM precursor, and cerebral deep white matter lesions (DWMLs) in association with cognitive decline.
METHODS: The study participants were 288 patients (194 men, 94 women) who gave consent to participate in a 5-year longitudinal survey on arteriosclerosis from 2008 to 2013. The Fazekas classification system (Grade [G] 0 [normal] to G3 [severe]) was used for the evaluation of DWMLs on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, all participants were asked to undergo cognitive function tests regarding word/letter fluency, the results of which were assessed for correlations with MR-proADM levels.
RESULTS: MR-proADM levels significantly increased with DWML grade progression. The odds ratio for high MR-proADM levels was 3.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.49-5.17) in the groups graded G3 on brain MRI, suggesting that a high level of MR-proADM is an independent risk factor for DWMLs. A significant inverse correlation was observed between MR-proADM levels and cognitive test scores. MR-proADM levels were significantly increased in the G3 group in 2013 compared with 2008.
CONCLUSION: MR-proADM levels were significantly different between the DWML groups and inversely correlated with cognitive function test scores, suggesting that high MR-proADM levels and DWMLs are associated with cognitive decline.

RESULTS: We observed 234 cases of all-cause dementia over 10 years of follow-up. In multivariable analyses, prolonged sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-3.26). These findings were driven by persons with baseline mild cognitive impairment (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.06-7.55) and persons without a high school degree (HR 6.05; 95% CI 3.00-12.18). Transitioning to sleeping >9 hours over a mean period of 13 years before baseline was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.44-4.11) and clinical Alzheimer disease (HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.17-4.13).

Here, we studied whether p-alpha-syn may serve as a biomarker in patients with a high risk of developing PD, such as those with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We compared the presence and distribution of p-alpha-syn deposits in dermal nerve fibres in 18 patients with RBD, 25 patients with early PD and 20 normal controls. Skin biopsy was taken at C7, Th10, and the upper and lower leg. Presynaptic dopamine transporter imaging using FP-CIT-SPECT was performed in all patients with RBD and in 11 patients with PD. All RBD patients underwent olfactory function testing. The likelihood ratio (LR) for prodromal PD was calculated for each patient based on published research criteria. Skin serial sections were assessed by double-immunofluorescence labelling with antibodies to pSer129-alpha-syn under blinded conditions. P-alpha-syn was visualized in 10/18 patients with RBD (sensitivity of 55.6%) and in 20/25 early PD patients (sensitivity of 80%) but in none of the controls (specificity of 100%). The percentage of dermal structures innervated by p-alpha-syn-positive fibres was negatively correlated with dopamine transporter binding in the FP-CIT-SPECT (ρ = -0.377, p = 0.048), with olfactory function (ρ = -0.668, p = 0.002), and positively correlated with the total LR for RBD to present prodromal PD (ρ = 0.531, p = 0.023). Dermal p-alpha-syn can be considered a peripheral histopathological marker of synucleinopathy and can be detected in a subgroup of RBD patients presumably representing prodromal PD. Dermal p-alpha-syn is detectable in RBD patients without PD motor symptoms, thereby stratifying a patient group that is of great interest for clinical trials testing disease-modifying drugs.","2017",,"Acta Neuropathol"," Here , we studied whether p-alpha-syn may serve as a biomarker in patients with a high risk of developing PD , such as those with REM sleep behaviour disorder ( RBD ) ","other","Aged, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Biopsy, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Fluorescent Antibody Technique, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Leg, FALSE, innervation, Q000294, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Phosphorylation, FALSE, Prodromal Symptoms, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Radiopharmaceuticals, FALSE, Skin, FALSE, innervation, Q000294, Smell, FALSE, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, FALSE, Tropanes, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1) is a surface marker of brain HDL-like particles associated with the time of PD onset. Clinical correlates of serum Apolipoprotein A1 levels with structural brain connectivity in PD-related disorders remains unclear. Here, we applied a novel diffusion-weighted imaging approach [Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Connectometry] to explore the association between ApoA-1 and structural brain connectivity in PD. Participants involved in this research were recruited from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted using a multiple regression against apoA-1 for 36 patients with DTI measurements available in the baseline visit. Fiber results of the connectometry were then reconstructed for each patient, and diffusion parameters were extracted and regressed against apoA-1 levels. Connectometry results revealed the subgenual cingulum to be associated with ApoA-1, with different FDR yields. This result was further supported by significant negative correlation of Quantitative Anisotropic (QA) of left subgenual cingulum (Pearson's coefficient = -0.398, p = 0.020) and Generalized Fractional Anisotropic (GFA) of right subgenual cingulum (Pearson's coefficient -0.457, p = 0.007) with plasma apoA-1 levels, in a multiple regression model with age and sex. The subgenual cingulum encompasses fibers from the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior thalamus. These structures are involved in PD-associated psychosis and executive cognitive decline.

Cortical cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs), a novel MRI marker of cerebral vascular disease, have not been studied, to date, in relation to subclinical and clinical cardiac diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of blood biomarkers of subclinical cardiac disease and clinically manifest cardiac diseases with CMIs graded on 3-T MRI in a memory clinic population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This baseline cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study performed from August 12, 2010, to July 28, 2015, included 464 memory clinic participants. All participants underwent collection of blood samples, neuropsychological assessment, and 3-T MRI.
EXPOSURES: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) concentrations were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Cardiac disease was defined as a history of atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart diseases, or congestive heart failure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The CMIs were graded according to a previously validated protocol.
RESULTS: Of 464 participants, 124 had insufficient blood plasma samples and 97 had no CMI grading (none, incomplete, or ungradable MRI), leaving a sample size of 243 for final analysis (mean [SD] age, 72.8 [9.1] years; 116 men [42.9%]). Seventy participants (28.8%) had cortical CMIs (median, 1; range, 0-43). Compared with participants with no CMIs, those with CMIs had a significantly higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (rate ratio [RR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.20-21.8), ischemic heart disease (RR, 4.31; 95% CI, 3.38-5.49), and congestive heart failure (RR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.29-3.25). Significantly higher levels of NT-proBNP (RR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.33-4.27) and hs-cTnT (RR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.00-4.74) were found in participants with CMIs. In multivariate models adjusted for demographics and vascular risk factors, higher levels of NT-proBNP (RR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.62-3.90) and hs-cTnT (RR, 4.86; 95% CI, 3.03-7.08) were associated with CMIs. These associations persisted even after excluding patients with clinically manifest cardiac disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that biomarkers of subclinical cardiac disease and clinically manifest cardiac diseases were associated with CMIs on 3-T MRI in patients attending a memory clinic, suggesting that cardiac disease may contribute to the development of CMIs. Hence, cardiac dysfunction should be targeted as a potentially modifiable factor to prevent CMI-related brain injury.","2017",,"JAMA Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : To examine the association of blood biomarkers of subclinical cardiac disease and clinically manifest cardiac diseases with CMIs graded on 3-T MRI in a memory clinic population ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Heart Diseases, TRUE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, Imaging, Three-Dimensional, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Natriuretic Peptide, Brain, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Peptide Fragments, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Troponin T, FALSE, blood, Q000097",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We aimed to evaluate the association between a specific inflammation marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), and dementia in an elderly Asian community cohort.
METHODS: The cohort included 1436 individuals (ages 65 and older) from a national representative sample in Taiwan. Dementia incidence was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for vascular dementia, Alzheimer disease, and nonvascular dementia. Baseline characteristics and CRP levels were determined. A Cox proportional hazard model and Fine and Grays model were adjusted for stroke and competing risk of death to estimate the association between inflammation and development of dementia.
RESULTS: During 11.04 years (median) of follow-up, 607 individuals (50.77%) died and 260 individuals (18.11%) were diagnosed with dementia. Those with high CRP had a 55% higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.00) compared with those with normal CRP. After adjusting for possible confounding cardiovascular risk factors, high CRP was independently associated with vascular dementia but not Alzheimer disease.

SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults.
MESUREMENTS: Cognitive impairment and dementia, defined by validated neuropsychological tests or clinical guidelines, respectively, and cognitive function, assessed by validated instruments.
RESULTS: Thirty-two eligible studies were identified. Albuminuria was associated with cognitive impairment (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.35, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.19-1.53; 7,852 cases), dementia (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.10-1.65; 5,758 cases), clinical Alzheimer's disease (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.11-1.69; 629 cases) and vascular dementia (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.16-3.31; 186 cases); the effect remained significant among longitudinal, population-based and high quality studies. Time-to-event analysis on prospective studies of non-demented at baseline individuals also showed a significant association with incident dementia (Risk Ratio: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.16-1.99; 971 cases).

CMB detection may reflect the cumulative effect of vascular risk burden and be a marker of higher mortality. We investigated the relation of CMB to risk of death in community dwelling participants free of stroke and dementia.
METHODS: We evaluated 1963 Framingham Original and Offspring Cohort participants (mean age 67 years; 54% women) with available brain magnetic resonance imaging and mortality data. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we related CMB to all-cause, cardiovascular, and stroke-related mortality.
RESULTS: Participants with CMB (8.9%) had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and use of preventive medications. During a mean follow-up of 7.2±2.6 years, we observed 296 deaths. In age- and sex-adjusted analysis, CMB were associated with increased all-cause mortality (hazards ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.88), a relation that was no longer significant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk and preventive medication use (hazards ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.63).
CONCLUSIONS: CMBs may represent the deleterious effect of cardiovascular risk factors in the cerebral vasculature.

DMN brain systems have been implicated in diverse social, cognitive, and affective processes, as well as risk for forms of dementia and psychiatric disorders that associate with systemic inflammation. Areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and surrounding medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) within the DMN have been implicated specifically in regulating autonomic and neuroendocrine processes that relate to systemic inflammation via bidirectional signaling mechanisms. However, it is still unclear whether indicators of inflammation relate directly to coherent resting state activity of the ACC, mPFC, or other areas within the DMN. Accordingly, we tested whether plasma interleukin (IL)-6, an indicator of systemic inflammation, covaried with resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN among 98 adults aged 30-54 (39% male; 81% Caucasian). Independent component analyses were applied to resting state fMRI data to generate DMN connectivity maps. Voxel-wise regression analyses were then used to test for associations between IL-6 and DMN connectivity across individuals, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and fMRI signal motion. Within the DMN, IL-6 covaried positively with connectivity of the sub-genual ACC and negatively with a region of the dorsal medial PFC at corrected statistical thresholds. These novel findings offer evidence for a unique association between a marker of systemic inflammation (IL-6) and ACC and mPFC functional connectivity within the DMN, a network that may be important for linking aspects of immune function to psychological and behavioral states in health and disease.","2017",,"Brain Behav Immun",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Brain Mapping, FALSE, C-Reactive Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Inflammation, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Interleukin-6, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nerve Net, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Previous research suggests that cognitive impairment contributes to readmission. It is important to identify patients at risk for early readmission, and this might be accomplished efficiently using medical record data.
METHOD: We reviewed the medical records of 100 patients with kidney disease (57 women, mean age = 61.2) who were hospitalized in the nephrology unit at an urban U.S. hospital. For each patient, we recorded easily available indicators of cognitive impairment along with other potential risk factors, and also recorded the number of 30-day readmissions over the past year.
RESULTS: Half of the sample (n = 50) had at least 1 readmission (median = 0.5, range: 0-20). A lifetime history of delirium, which is a known marker of chronic cognitive impairment, was significantly related to readmissions, and several other impairment indicators (positive head imaging, history of seizures, and history of hypoxia) showed similar trends. A ""cognitive impairment index"" (positive for one or more variables possibly reflecting impaired central nervous system) was significantly related to the presence of a 30-day readmission, beyond the effects of a number of behavioral and medical covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: Easily accessible cognitive impairment markers, especially a known history of delirium, may be useful to identify patients in nephrology units who are at increased risk for early hospital readmissions.

RESULTS: Poorer OI in older adults without dementia was associated with increased risk of dementia. After adjustment for demographics, medical comorbidities, and lifestyle characteristics, white participants in the poor or moderate OI tertile had greater risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45-4.54; and HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.33-2.54, respectively) compared to those in the good tertile of function.

Most importantly, beyond its role as a molecular predictor of disease risk and progression, urate may constitute a novel therapeutic target. Indeed, clinical trials of urate elevation in PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are testing the impact of raising peripheral urate levels on disease outcomes.

In addition, SAC at the latter dose mitigated lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) and augmented key antioxidant defensive elements including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione (GSH) in hippocampal homogenate and lowered acetylcholinesterase activity. Meanwhile, SAC down-regulated hippocampal nuclear factor-<kappa>B, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and up-regulated nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in addition to lowering iba1-immunoreactive intensity in the hippocampus of LPS-injected group. Taken together, SAC administration could mitigate LPS-induced cognitive deficits via attenuation of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, astrogliosis, and acetylcholinesterase activity.","2017",,"Eur J Pharmacol",,"other","Acetylcholinesterase, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Animals, FALSE, Avoidance Learning, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Biomarkers, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Calcium-Binding Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Cysteine, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Discrimination, Psychological, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Garlic, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Hippocampus, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Interleukin-1beta, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Lipopolysaccharides, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Male, FALSE, Maze Learning, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Memory, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Microfilament Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, NF-E2-Related Factor 2, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, NF-kappa B, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Oxidative Stress, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Wistar, FALSE, Spatial Behavior, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Toll-Like Receptor 4, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

While the function and structure of large cerebral vessels can be easily studied, the brain's microvasculature remains difficult to assess. Previous studies have demonstrated that structural changes in the retinal vessel architecture predict stroke risk, but these changes occur at late disease stages. Our goal was to examine whether retinal vascular status can predict cerebral small vessel dysfunction during early stages of diabetes. Retinal vasoreactivity and cerebral vascular function were measured in 78 subjects (19 healthy controls, 22 subjects with prediabetes, and 37 with type-2 diabetes) using a new noninvasive retinal imaging device (Dynamic Vessel Analyzer) and transcranial Doppler studies, respectively. Cerebral blood vessel responsiveness worsened with disease progression of diabetes. Similarly, retinal vascular reactivity was significantly attenuated in subjects with prediabetes and diabetes compared to healthy controls. Subjects with prediabetes and diabetes with impaired cerebral vasoreactivity showed mainly attenuation of the retinal venous flicker response. This is the first study to explore the relationship between retinal and cerebral vascular function in diabetes. Impairment of venous retinal responsiveness may be one of the earliest markers of vascular dysfunction in diabetes possibly indicating subsequent risk of stroke and vascular dementia.","2017",,"J Neuroimaging",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Middle Cerebral Artery, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Prediabetic State, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Retina, FALSE, anatomy & histology, Q000033, Retinal Vessels, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Stroke, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Ultrasonography, Doppler, FALSE, Vasoconstriction, FALSE, Vasodilation, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Gait is complex, comprised of multiple characteristics sensitive to survival, age and pathology. Due to covariance amongst characteristics, conceptual gait models have been established to reduce redundancy and aid interpretation. Previous models have been derived from laboratory gait assessments which are costly in equipment and time. Body-worn monitors (BWM) allow for free-living, low-cost and continuous gait measurement and produce similar covariant gait characteristics. A BWM gait model from both controlled and free-living measurement has not yet been established, limiting utility.
METHODS: 103 control and 67 PD participants completed a controlled laboratory assessment; walking for two minutes around a circuit wearing a BWM. 89 control and 58 PD participants were assessed in free-living, completing normal activities for 7 days wearing a BWM. Fourteen gait characteristics were derived from the BWM, selected according to a previous model. Principle component analysis derived factor loadings of gait characteristics.
RESULTS: Four gait domains were derived for both groups and conditions; pace, rhythm, variability and asymmetry. Domains totalled 84.84% and 88.43% of variance for controlled and 90.00% and 93.03% of variance in free-living environments for control and PD participants respectively. Gait characteristic loading was unambiguous for all characteristics apart from gait variability which demonstrated cross-loading for both groups and environments. The model was highly congruent with the original model.
CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual gait models remained stable using a BWM in controlled and free-living environments.

Strikingly, these effects were only in younger T carriers (<50 years), where aging quells the effects of these genetic factors.

These methods are relatively invasive, costly, and often have high screening failure rates. Consequently, research is aiming to elucidate blood biomarkers of Aβ and tau.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate a case/control polygenic risk score (PGRS) as a marker of tau and investigate blood markers of a combined Aβ and tau outcome for the first time. A sub-study also considers plasma tau as markers of Aβ and tau pathology in CSF.
METHODS: We used data from the EDAR*, DESCRIPA**, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts in a logistic regression analysis to investigate blood markers of Aβ and tau in CSF. In particular, we investigated the extent to which a case/control PGRS is predictive of CSF tau, CSF amyloid, and a combined amyloid and tau outcome. The predictive ability of models was compared to that of age, gender, and APOE genotype ('basic model').
RESULTS: In EDAR and DESCRIPA test data, inclusion of a case/control PGRS was no more predictive of Aβ, and a combined Aβ and tau endpoint than the basic models (accuracies of 66.0%, and 73.3% respectively). The tau model saw a small increase in accuracy compared to basic models (59.6%). ADNI 2 test data also showed a slight increase in accuracy for the Aβ model when compared to the basic models (61.4%).
CONCLUSION: We see some evidence that a case/control PGRS is marginally more predictive of Aβ and tau pathology than the basic models. The search for predictive factors of Aβ and tau pathologies, above and beyond demographic information, is still ongoing. Better understanding of AD risk alleles, development of more sensitive assays, and studies of larger sample size are three avenues that may provide such factors. However, the clinical utility of possible predictors of brain Aβ and tau pathologies must also be investigated.*'Beta amyloid oligomers in the early diagnosis of AD and as marker for treatment response'**'Development of screening guidelines and criteria for pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease'.","2017",,"J Alzheimers Dis"," Consequently , research is aiming to elucidate blood biomarkers of Aβ and tau ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Biomarkers, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Databases, Factual, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Early Diagnosis, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Logistic Models, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, FALSE, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Positron-Emission Tomography, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE, blood, Q000097",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Our aim was to analyze if a decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio over time could have an impact on neurocognitive deterioration. Randomly selected HIV-infected patients were followed for neuropsychological (NP) testing during a period of almost 2 years. Tests were adjusted for age, gender, and education. Patients were divided into 5 groups: normal tests (NT), neuropsychological deficit (ND, one impaired cognitive domain), asymptomatic neurocognitive disorders (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorders (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Risk factors for neurocognitive deterioration were analyzed. Two hundred fifty-six patients underwent NP tests and 94 participated in the follow-up. The groups were comparable. Upon neuropsychological re-testing, six patients showed clinical improvement, 30 had worsened, and 58 were stable, resulting in 42 patients presenting with HAND (45 %). The majority of HAND cases consisted of ANI (26 %) and MND (16 %). In patients whose NP performance worsened, CPE 2010 score was lower at inclusion (7.13 vs 8.00, p = 0.003) and CD4/CD8 decrease more frequent (60 vs 31 %, p = 0.008) than in those who were stable or improved.

METHODS: Participants were 147 African Americans (AAs) and whites (ages 33-71 years; 43% AA; 56% female; 26% below poverty) in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span SCAN substudy. Cranial MRI was conducted using a 3.0 T unit. White matter (WM) lesion volumes and total brain, gray matter, and WM volumes were computed. An SES composite was derived from education and poverty status.
RESULTS: Significant interactions of race and SES were observed for WM lesion volume (b = 1.38; η = 0.036; p = .028), total brain (b = 86.72; η = 0.042; p < .001), gray matter (b = 40.16; η = 0.032; p = .003), and WM (b = 46.56; η = 0.050; p < .001).

In the present study, we evaluated the roles of non-motor symptoms and signs and imaging biomarkers of nigral neuronal changes and α-synuclein accumulation in the colon. Twelve subjects undergoing colectomy for primary colon cancer were recruited for this study. Immunohistochemical staining for α-synuclein in normal and phosphorylated forms was performed in normally appearing colonic tissue. We evaluated 16 candidate premotor risk factors in this study cohort. Among them, ten subjects showed positive immunostaining with normal- and phosphorylated-α-synuclein. An accumulation of premotor markers in each subject was accompanied with positive normal- and phosphorylated-α-synuclein immunostaining, ranging from 2 to 7 markers per subject, whereas the absence of Lewy bodies in the colon was associated with relative low numbers of premotor signs. A principal component analysis and a cluster analysis of these premotor markers suggest that urinary symptoms were commonly clustered with deposition of peripheral phosphorylated-α-synuclein. Among other premotor marker, color vision abnormalities were related to non-smoking. This mathematical approach confirmed the clustering of premotor markers in preclinical stage of Parkinson's disease.

,"29634094","VITAMIN D IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE - PROPHYLAXIS OR THERAPY?","Gruber-Bzura BM","The pleiotropism of vitamin D is due to the presence of vitamin D receptor in the cells of nearly all tissues and organs within the human body, including the CNS. Multiple evidence is available to support neuroprotective properties of vitamin D. These include, for example, the presence of 25(OH)D-lot-hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for production of calcitriol, within the human brain. Among its other activities, calcitriol modifies production and release of neurotrophic factors, affects expression of genes associated with GABAergic signaling and stimulates biosynthesis of catecholamines. Antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties were also demonstrated in research studies. By confronting the known pathomechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the mechanism of action of vitamin D, one may propose that systemic insufficiency of vitamin D is a potential risk factor of AD. Studies conducted to date confirm the inverse relationship between serum calcidiol levels and the risk of dementia diseases, including AD. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid level of VDBP, a vitamin D binding protein that is also responsible for elimination of P-amyloid peptide (AP), a pathogenic factor characteristic for AD, is considered to be a potential marker of AD. Reduction in AP levels within the CNS is the most important therapeutic target in the treatment of AD. Animal studies confirmed the impact of vitamin D-enriched diet on the reduction in amyloid deposits, AP peptide levels and inflammatory reactions as well as on the increase in the level of neurotrophic factor within the brains of AP protein precursor (APPP) - transgenic mice. In case of AD, the purposefulness of initiating treatment before the onset of clinical symptoms is being highlighted. Vitamin D is worth consideration since by inducing the expression of VDR gene it leads, among others, to the silencing of the transcription of the gene encoding the AOAPP and thus inhibits its cleavage into peptides that form amyloid deposits. Despite the fact that at current state vitamin D can hardly be considered a therapeutic agent with an established efficient dose in AD, authors of studies suggest that it is important in AD prophylaxis in elderly patients with age-related reduction of serum calcidiol lev- els.","2016",,"Acta Pol Pharm"," In case of AD , the purposefulness of initiating treatment before the onset of clinical symptoms is being highlighted "," review","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Animals, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Calcifediol, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Calcitriol, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Transgenic, FALSE, Neuroprotective Agents, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Receptors, Calcitriol, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Vitamin D, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We consider the necessary properties of a marker, before providing an overview of the proven and potential markers of prodromal PD, including clinical nonmotor markers, clinical motor markers, neuroimaging markers and tissue biomarkers. Markers for which the ability to predict conversion to PD is supported by the strongest evidence include olfactory loss, REM sleep behaviour disorder and constipation. Markers with the highest diagnostic strength include REM sleep behaviour disorder, dopaminergic imaging and subtle motor parkinsonism. The lead time - the period between the appearance of a marker and conversion to PD - is highly variable between markers, ranging from 5 years for impaired motor performance to >20 years for autonomic symptoms. The cost of screening for these markers also varies dramatically: some require just questionnaires, whereas others require sophisticated scanning techniques.

METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, an electronic medical records data from the United Kingdom, from 2003 to 2012. We included patients aged >65 years diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with no prior diagnosis of dementia. Dementia was defined using diagnosis codes from medical records. All patients were followed from the date of initial diabetes diagnosis. To account for competing risk of death, we used Fine and Gray's competing risk model to determine the association of hypoglycemia with dementia while adjusting for potential confounders. Hypoglycemia was modeled as a time-dependent covariate.
RESULTS: Of 53,055 patients, 5.7% (n = 3,018) had at least one hypoglycemia episodes. The overall incidence rate of dementia was 12.7 per 1,000 person-years. In the fully adjusted model that controlled for all confounders, the occurrence of at least one hypoglycemia episode was associated with 27% higher odds of subsequent dementia (hazard ratio = 1.27; 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.51).

Heart failure is closely related to higher risk of neurocognitive disorders. Recent evidence shows that this relationship might not be limited to patients with advanced heart failure, and even suboptimal cardiac functioning is associated with accelerated brain aging. Hence, hemodynamic and serum cardiac markers may provide valuable information about the risk of dementia.
METHODS: We provide an overview on the link between cardiac markers and cognitive function by a systematic search in five databases. Furthermore, we discuss the pathophysiological aspects of this link and highlight the pertinent clinical and public health implications.

METHODS: Participants (aged 60 years and older) from the multiethnic Epidemiology of Dementia In Singapore Study underwent detailed neuropsychological testing and 3T brain MRI. Cortical CMIs were graded using a previously validated protocol. Cognitive impairment was categorized into cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND)-mild, CIND-moderate, and dementia. Cognitive function was summarized as composite and domain-specific z scores.
RESULTS: Among 861 participants, 54 (6.3%) had ≥1 cortical CMI. In multivariate-adjusted models, the risk factors of cortical CMIs were increasing age, Malay ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, history of stroke, and markers of both large (cortical infarcts and intracranial stenosis) and small (lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds) vessel disease. Presence of cortical CMIs was associated with CIND-moderate (odds ratio: 3.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-8.58), dementia (odds ratio: 16.92; 95% CI: 3.37-85.05), and poorer cognitive function (mean difference in composite z score: -0.42; 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.21). Additional adjustments for vascular risk factors and other MRI markers did not alter these associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical CMIs are a novel MRI marker of cerebrovascular disease and are independently associated with cognitive impairment and dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To assess if stratification by age, sex, and genetic risk factors improves the accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in patients with rapidly progressive dementia.
METHODS: 1,538 individuals with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 173 with classic Alzheimer's disease (cAD), 37 with rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD), and 589 without signs of dementia were included in this retrospective diagnostic study. The effect of age, sex, PRNP codon 129, and APOE genotype on CSF levels of tau, p-tau, Aβ1-42, and Aβ1-40 values measured at time of diagnostic work-up was assessed.
RESULTS: Tau was a better marker for the differentiation of CJD and rpAD in older (AUC:0.97; 95% CI:0.96-1.00) than in younger (AUC:0.91; 95% CI:0.87-0.94) patients as tau levels increased with age in CJD patients, but not in rpAD patients.

DESIGN: The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (EHLS), a longitudinal, population-based study of aging in the Beaver Dam, Wisconsin community. Baseline examinations were conducted in 1993 and follow-up examinations have been conducted every 5 years.
SETTING: General community.
PARTICIPANTS: EHLS members without cognitive impairment at EHLS-2 (1998-2000). There were 1,884 participants (mean age 66.7) with complete EHLS-2 sensory data and follow-up information.
MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score of <24 or history of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Hearing impairment was a pure-tone average of hearing thresholds (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) of >25 dB hearing level in either ear, visual impairment was a Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity of <1.55 log units in the better eye, and olfactory impairment was a San Diego Odor Identification Test score of <6.
RESULTS: Hearing, visual, and olfactory impairment were independently associated with cognitive impairment risk (hearing: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-3.26; vision: HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.24-3.38; olfaction: HR = 3.92, 95% CI = 2.45-6.26)). Nevertheless, 85% of participants with hearing impairment, 81% with visual impairment, and 76% with olfactory impairment did not develop cognitive impairment during follow-up.

This study shows that the temporal organization of gait variability can represent a marker of gait instability that complements standard assessment of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Temporal organization (long-range autocorrelation; LRA) of stride duration variability, collected from 20 persons with Parkinson's disease walking overground at a comfortable speed, was studied. The presence of LRA was based on the scaling properties of the series variability and the shape of the power spectral density. Simultaneously, measures of neurological impairment (MDS-UPDRS), balance (BESTest), and balance confidence (ABC-Scale) were collected. To precisely identify the relationship between LRA and functional measures, correlation coefficients were applied.
RESULTS: Degradation of LRA was strongly correlated with other clinical scores, in such a way that the temporal organization of gait variability was more random for patients presenting with greater motor impairments. Importantly, these measures were relatively independent of age, and gait speed, thus they can be applied to a wide clinical population.  Conclusion: The findings of this study emphasize that temporal organization of gait variability is related to degree of functional impairment in Parkinson's disease.

It has been suggested that DRD is a neurochemical rather than neurodegenerative disorder.
METHODS: Transcranial brain sonography, which might be a risk marker for nigral injury, was obtained from 141 subjects divided into four groups: (i) 11 patients with genetically confirmed DRD; (ii) 55 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); (iii) 30 patients diagnosed as isolated adult-onset focal dystonia; and (iv) 45 healthy controls (HCs).
RESULTS: Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity was present in 63.6% of patients with DRD, which was significantly different in comparison to patients with dystonia (20%) and HCs (6.7%), but not in comparison to the PD group (87.3%). Also, values of the maximal areas of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity in patients with DRD were higher in comparison to HCs, but significantly lower than among the PD group.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggested that the observed transcranial brain sonography features in patients with DRD might primarily be risk markers for particular clinical features (parkinsonism, dystonia) occurring in the specific genetic context (i.e. GCH1 mutations), or might reflect compensated neurodegenerative processes triggered by the long-lasting dopamine deficiency due to the profound delay in levodopa treatment in our patients with DRD.","2017",,"Eur J Neurol","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Mutations in the GCH1 gene , encoding GTP cyclohydrolase 1 , the enzyme critically important for dopamine production in nigrostriatal neurons , are the most common cause of dopa-responsive dystonia ( DRD ) , characterized predominantly by limb dystonia , although parkinsonian features may also be present ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, Dystonic Disorders, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Female, FALSE, GTP Cyclohydrolase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Levodopa, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

A cognitive complaint index was calculated using responses to a 120-item questionnaire. Seed regions were identified for resting state brain networks important for higher-order cognitive processes and for areas that have shown differences in volume and functional activity associated with cognitive complaints in prior studies. Results indicated a positive correlation between the executive control network and cognitive complaint score, weaker negative functional connectivity within the frontal cortex, and stronger positive connectivity within the right middle temporal gyrus in postmenopausal women who report more cognitive complaints. While longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, these data are consistent with previous findings suggesting that high levels of cognitive complaints may reflect changes in brain connectivity and may be a potential marker for the risk of late-life cognitive dysfunction in postmenopausal women with otherwise normal cognitive performance.","2016",,"Front Neurosci",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: A sample of 419 patients comprising Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 156), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 87), frontotemporal dementia (FTD; n = 127), vascular dementia (VD; n = 37), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 12) was analysed in comparison with a control group (n = 138). APOE genotyping and MAPT haplotyping were performed on all study subjects.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that variability on the APOE locus influenced the relative risk of dementia in the study population. The APOE ε4 allele increased the disease risk most significantly for AD (OR = 3.468, p < 0.0001) and MCI (OR = 2.901, p < 0.0001). The APOE ε2 allele remained protective for AD (OR = 0.205, p < 0.05). For FTD, VD, and DLB, the APOE ε4 allele was ineffectual in modulating disease risk. The MAPT H1 haplotype was not an overrepresented marker of neurodegenerative diseases. The H1H1 genotype had an additive effect in contributing to either disease risk in combination with the APOE ε4 allele or protection in combination with the APOE ε2 or ε3 allele.

In this study, we evaluated whether individuals with high occupational attainment show more frequent progression from MCI to AD. Participants (n = 961) with MCI were recruited from a nationwide, hospital-based multi-center cohort, and were followed for up to 60 months (median: 17.64, interquartile range [12.36, 29.28]). We used Cox regression for competing risks to analyze the effect of occupational attainment on development of AD, treating dementia other than AD as a competing risk. Among the 961 individuals with MCI, a total of 280 (29.1%) converted to dementia during the follow-up period. The risk of progression to AD was higher in the individuals with high occupational attainment after controlling for potential confounders (hazard ratio = 1.83, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-2.69, p = 0.002). High occupational attainment in individuals with MCI is an independent risk factor for higher progression rate of MCI to AD.

Whereas all examined striatal (caudate and putamen) dopamine neuronal markers are decreased in Parkinson's disease, levels of only some (dopamine, dopamine transporter) but not others (dopamine metabolites, synthetic enzymes, vesicular monoamine transporter 2) are below normal in methamphetamine users. This suggests that loss of dopamine neurones might not be characteristic of methamphetamine exposure in at least some human drug users. In methamphetamine users, dopamine loss was more marked in caudate than in putamen, whereas in Parkinson's disease, the putamen is distinctly more affected. Substantia nigra loss of dopamine-containing cell bodies is characteristic of Parkinson's disease, but similar neuropathological studies have yet to be conducted in methamphetamine users. Similarly, it is uncertain whether brain gliosis, a common feature of brain damage, occurs after methamphetamine exposure in humans. Preliminary epidemiological findings suggest that methamphetamine use might increase risk of subsequent development of Parkinson's disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included patients with acute ICH. Pre-ICH cognitive impairment was determined based on the results of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) that uses information from close relatives. Patients were assessed as having been cognitively impaired with an IQCODE score of ≥3.44; an IQCODE ≥4.00 indicated pre-ICH dementia. CT and MRI images were reviewed to determine the extent of white matter lesions and to measure the radial width of the temporal horn as marker of brain atrophy. We investigated differences of cardiovascular risk factors and imaging data between patients with and without pre-ICH cognitive impairment using correlation analyses, uni- and multivariable regression models. Functional neurological state was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The mRS was dichotomized at the level of 3, and a premorbid mRS of 0-2 was considered as functional independency.
RESULTS: Among the 89 participants, median age was 70 years (interquartile range 58-78) and 52 (58.4%) were male. IQCODE indicated pre-ICH cognitive impairment in 18.0% (16 of 89), and 83.1% were functionally independent before ICH. Cognitive impairment was associated with a premorbid mRS≥3 (chi squared test, P=0.009). In multivariable analysis, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (OR 18.29, 95%-CI 1.945-172.033, P=.011) and hematoma volume (OR 0.90, 95%-CI 0.812-0.991, P=.033) were independently associated with pre-ICH cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, cognitive impairment frequently precedes ICH. A higher frequency of cerebrovascular events suggests a role of vascular processes in the development of cognitive impairment before ICH.","2017",,"Acta Neurol Scand"," OBJECTIVES : Preexisting cognitive impairment is a predictor of cognitive decline after ischemic stroke , but evidence in intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) is limited ","other","Aged, FALSE, Cerebral Hemorrhage, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The long-term cognitive consequences of the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology and neurodegeneration, and whether they have an independent or synergistic effect on cognition, are unclear. We aimed to characterise the long-term clinical and cognitive trajectories of healthy elderly individuals using a two-marker (Alzheimer's disease pathology and neurodegeneration) imaging construct.
METHODS: Between Nov 3, 2006, and Nov 25, 2014, 573 cognitively healthy individuals in Melbourne and Perth, Australia, (mean age 73·1 years [SD 6·2]; 58% women) were enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Alzheimer's disease pathology (A) was determined by measuring Aβ deposition by PET, and neurodegeneration (N) was established by measuring hippocampal volume using MRI. Individuals were categorised as A(-)N(-), A(+)N(-), A(+)N(+), or suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology (A(-)N(+), SNAP). Clinical progression, hippocampal volume, standard neuropsychological tests, and domain-specific and global cognitive composite scores were assessed over 6 years of follow-up. Linear mixed effect models and a Cox proportional hazards model of survival were used to evaluate, compare, and contrast the clinical, cognitive, and volumetric trajectories of patients in the four AN categories.
FINDINGS: 50 (9%) healthy individuals were classified as A(+)N(+), 87 (15%) as A(+)N(-), 310 (54%) as A(-)N(-), and 126 (22%) as SNAP. APOE ε4 was more frequent in participants in the A(+)N(+) (27; 54%) and A(+)N(-) (42; 48%) groups than in the A(-)N(-) (66; 21%) and SNAP groups (23; 18%). The A(+)N(-) and A(+)N(+) groups had significantly faster cognitive decline than the A(-)N(-) group (0·08 SD per year for AIBL-Preclinical AD Cognitive Composite [PACC]; p<0·0001; and 0·25; p<0·0001; respectively). The A (+)N(+) group also had faster hippocampal atrophy than the A(-)N(-) group (0·04 cm(3) per year; p=0·02). The SNAP group generally did not show significant decline over time compared with the A(-)N(-) group (0·03 SD per year [p=0·19] for AIBL-PACC and a 0·02 cm(3) per year increase [p=0·16] for hippocampal volume), although SNAP was sometimes associated with lower baseline cognitive scores (0·20 SD less than A(-)N(-) for AIBL-PACC). Within the follow-up, 24% (n=12) of individuals in the A(+)N(+) group and 16% (n=14) in the A(+)N(-) group progressed to amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, compared with 9% (n=11) in the SNAP group.
INTERPRETATION: Brain amyloidosis, a surrogate marker of Alzheimer's disease pathology, is a risk factor for cognitive decline and for progression from preclinical stages to symptomatic stages of the disease, with neurodegeneration acting as a compounding factor. However, neurodegeneration alone does not confer a significantly different risk of cognitive decline from that in the group with neither brain amyloidosis or neurodegeneration.

In the domain of cognition, feeling older than one's chronological age is related to lower cognitive performance and steeper cognitive decline among older adults. The present study examines whether an older subjective age is associated with the risk of incident cognitive impairment and dementia.
METHOD: Participants were 5,748 individuals aged 65 years and older drawn from the Health and Retirement Study. Measures of subjective age, cognition, and covariates were obtained at baseline, and follow-up cognition was assessed over a 2- to 4-year period. Only participants without cognitive impairment were included at baseline. At follow-up, participants were classified into one of the three categories: normal functioning, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and dementia.
RESULTS: An older subjective age at baseline was associated with higher likelihood of CIND (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18; 1.09-1.28) and dementia (OR = 1.29; 1.02-1.63) at follow-up, controlling for chronological age, other demographic factors, and baseline cognition.

Aging is considered the primary risk factor for some 90% of Alzheimer's cases but a significant 10% of patients suffer from aggressive, early-onset forms of the disease. There is currently no effective Alzheimer's treatment and this, coupled with a growing aging population, highlights the necessity to understand the mechanism(s) of disease initiation and propagation. A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates (an early marker of Alzheimer's disease), and neurofibrillary tangles, comprising the hyper-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein Tau. Recent Advances: Protein oxidation is frequently invoked as a potential factor in the progression of Alzheimer's disease; however, whether it is a cause or a consequence of the pathology is still being debated. The Proteasome complex is a major regulator of intracellular protein quality control and an essential proteolytic enzyme for the processing of both Aβ and Tau. Recent studies have indicated that both protein oxidation and excessive phosphorylation may limit Proteasomal processing of Aβ and Tau in Alzheimer's disease.
CRITICAL ISSUES: Thus, the Proteasome may be a key factor in understanding the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology; however, its significance is still very much under investigation.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Discovering how the proteasome is affected, regulated, or dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease could be a valuable tool in the efforts to understand and, ultimately, eradicate the disease.

While the cellular mechanisms associating GBA1 mutations and PD are unknown, loss of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCase) activity, inhibition of autophagy and increased α-synuclein levels have been implicated. Here we show that autophagy lysosomal reformation (ALR) is compromised in cells lacking functional GCase. ALR is a cellular process controlled by mTOR which regenerates functional lysosomes from autolysosomes formed during macroautophagy. A decrease in phopho-S6K levels, a marker of mTOR activity, was observed in models of GCase deficiency, including primary mouse neurons and the PD patient derived fibroblasts with GBA1 mutations, suggesting that ALR is compromised. Importantly Rab7, a GTPase crucial for endosome-lysosome trafficking and ALR, accumulated in GCase deficient cells, supporting the notion that lysosomal recycling is impaired. Recombinant GCase treatment reversed ALR inhibition and lysosomal dysfunction. Moreover, ALR dysfunction was accompanied by impairment of macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy, increased levels of total and phosphorylated (S129) monomeric α-synuclein, evidence of amyloid oligomers and increased α-synuclein release. Concurrently, we found increased cholesterol and altered glucosylceramide homeostasis which could compromise ALR. We propose that GCase deficiency in PD inhibits lysosomal recycling. Consequently neurons are unable to maintain the pool of mature and functional lysosomes required for the autophagic clearance of α-synuclein, leading to the accumulation and spread of pathogenic α-synuclein species in the brain. Since GCase deficiency and lysosomal dysfunction occur with ageing and sporadic PD pathology, the decrease in lysosomal reformation may be a common feature in PD.","2016",,"Hum Mol Genet",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Autophagy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Fibroblasts, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Gaucher Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Glucosylceramidase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Lysosomes, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Mice, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, rab GTP-Binding Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, rab7 GTP-Binding Proteins, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that multi-digit synergies may capture early and subclinical basal ganglia dysfunction. We chose asymptomatic welders to test the hypothesis because the basal ganglia are known to be most susceptible to neurotoxicity caused by welding-related metal accumulation (such as manganese and iron).
METHODS: Twenty right-handed welders and 13 matched controls were invited to perform single- and multi-finger pressing tasks using the fingers of the right or left hand. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Grooved Pegboard scores were used to gauge gross and fine motor dysfunction, respectively. High-resolution (3T) T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T1 mapping, susceptibility, and diffusion tensor MRIs were obtained to reflect manganese, iron accumulation, and microstructural changes in basal ganglia. The synergy index stabilizing total force and anticipatory synergy adjustments were computed, compared between groups, and correlated with estimates of basal ganglia manganese [the pallidal index, R1 (1/T1)], iron [R2* (1/T2*)], and microstructural changes [fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity].
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (total or motor subscale) or Grooved Pegboard test scores between welders and controls. The synergy index during steady-state accurate force production was decreased significantly in the left hand of welders compared to controls (p=0.004) but did not reach statistical significance in the right hand (p=0.16). Anticipatory synergy adjustments, however, were not significantly different between groups. Among welders, higher synergy indices in the left hand were associated significantly with higher fractional anisotropy values in the left globus pallidus (R=0.731, p<0.001) but not with the pallidal index, R1, or R2* values in the basal ganglia.

EEG studies in healthy controls (HCs) have suggested that the increase in theta power observed after negative outcome is a marker of reward processing.
OBJECTIVE: To compare outcome-locked, event-related spectral perturbation in a gambling task in PD patients with and without ICDs and in HCs.
METHODS: Twelve PD patients with ICDs, 12 PD patients without ICDs and 14 HCs underwent EEG while performing a gambling task. The groups were compared in terms of (i) the peak EEG power in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands between 200 and 500 ms after the outcome, and (ii) time-frequency plots at Fz, FCz and Cz.
RESULTS: Positive outcomes were associated with greater theta power than negative outcomes in patients without ICDs and in HCs, but not in patients with ICDs. Patients with ICDs and HCs displayed greater theta power following unexpectedly high outcomes. HCs displayed greater beta power following high amplitude than low amplitude outcomes, whereas patients with ICD showed the opposite pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: In PD, ICDs are associated with (i) weaker modulation of frontocentral theta power by reward valence, (ii) greater frontocentral theta power following unexpected, high outcomes, and (iii) a reversal of the effect of risk on beta oscillations.

METHODS: We performed a comprehensive non-systematic review on PubMed. The keywords used in the search were terms related to subjective cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Subjective cognitive decline is characterized by self-experience of deterioration in cognitive performance not detected objectively through formal neuropsychological testing. However, various terms and definitions have been used in the literature and the lack of a widely accepted concept hampers comparison of studies. Epidemiological data have shown that individuals with subjective cognitive decline are at increased risk of progression to AD dementia.

An elderly female with a history of cerebellar stroke and recurrent falling undertook three standard gait trials and three gait trials with an auditory metronome. A Vicon system was used to collect 3-D marker trajectory data. The coefficient of variation was calculated for temporal and spatial gait parameters. SDs of the joint angles were calculated and used to give a measure of joint kinematic variability. Step time, stance time, and double support time variability were reduced with metronome cueing. Variability in the sagittal hip, knee, and ankle angles were reduced to normal values when walking to the metronome. In summary, metronome cueing resulted in a decrease in variability for step, stance, and double support times and joint kinematics.

Orthostatic BP dysregulation may lie on the causal pathway to dementia. Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is commonly reported by older people some of whom may progress to dementia. We hypothesised that sub-clinical orthostatic hypotension would be associated with SMI and explored these associations according to sex.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data from 4340 participants aged 50 and over collected during the first wave (2009-2011) of the cohort study, The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Subjective memory was rated according to a 5-point scale ranging from 'poor' to 'excellent'. BP was measured during orthostatic stress using continuous non-invasive beat-to-beat recording over 2 min.
RESULTS: 2% reported 'poor' subjective memory, 12.3% 'fair' , 38% 'good', 33% 'very good' and 14.6% 'excellent'. After controlling for several potential confounding factors including cardiovascular risk, objective cognition, and depressive symptoms mean systolic orthostatic BP was lowest in those with poor subjective memory: 92.2 mmHg (CI95% = 87.1, 97.3) versus excellent 99.3 mmHg (CI95% = 97.4, 101.2); p = 0.011. Further adjustment for supine systolic BP suggested that men with poor subjective memory reached the lowest average systolic orthostatic BP and had the greatest impairment in systolic orthostatic BP stabilisation to baseline levels at 10 s post-stand (-6.64 mmHg; CI95% = -11.49, -1.79; p = 0.007).

We recruited 50 participants with a history of two or more falls (33 patients with Parkinson's Disease and 17 older adults) and 14 non-fallers age-matched adults. Cholinergic activity was estimated by means of short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique that assesses an inhibitory circuit in the sensorimotor cortex and is regarded as a global marker of cholinergic function in the brain. Increased difficulty to allocate attention during gait was evaluated by measuring gait performance under single and dual-task conditions. Global cognition was also assessed. Results showed that SAI was reduced in patients with PD than in the older adults (fallers and non-fallers) and in older adults fallers with respect to non-fallers. Reduction in SAI indicates less inhibition i.e., less cholinergic activity. Gait speed was reduced in the dual task gait compared to normal gait only in our faller population and changes in gait speed under dual task significantly correlated with the mean value of SAI. This association remained significant after adjusting for cognitive status.

RESULTS: There was no correlation between education and global cognitive performance in patients with DLB. However, there was a positive correlation between education and tests exploring visuoconstructive functions (Rey complex figure copy and recall) and verbal retrieval strategies (Grober and Buschke free recall test). There was also a positive correlation between education and dopamine transporter binding.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing (PCR-DS) was used to test the genotypes of DBH polymorphisms in 95 PD patients and 100 healthy examinees frequency-matched with the former by age and sex. The genotype and allele distribution differences between the case and control groups were analyzed by chi-square test, and the relative risk of PD in southern Chinese populations was expressed by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was also checked by chi-square test.

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognitive aging and dementia, which is easy to convert to AD dementia. It is an urgent problem in the field of cognitive neuroscience to reveal the conversion of aMCI-ε4 to AD. Based on our preliminary work, we will study the neuroimaging features in the special group of aMCI-ε4 with multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (structural MRI, resting state-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging) longitudinally.
METHODS/DESIGN: In this study, 200 right-handed subjects who are diagnosed as aMCI with APOE-ε4 will be recruited at the memory clinic of the Neurology Department, XuanWu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. All subjects will undergo the neuroimaging and neuropsychological evaluation at a 1 year-interval for 3 years. The primary outcome measures are 1) Microstructural alterations revealed with multimodal MRI scans including structure MRI (sMRI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); 2) neuropsychological evaluation, including the World Health Organization-University of California-LosAngeles Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT), Addenbrook's cognitive examination-revised (ACE-R), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR).

A literature search of T2DM and dementia or cognition impairments was carried out in electronic databases Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. In this review, the chosen evidence was limited to human subject studies only, and data on either type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or non-classified diabetes were excluded. T2DM is a risk factor for both vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), although AD pathological marker studies have not provided sufficient evidence. T2DM interacts additively or synergistically with many factors, including old age, hypertension, total cholesterol, and APOEɛ4 carrier status for impaired cognition functions seen in patients with T2DM. In addition, comorbid T2DM can worsen the clinical presentations of patients with either AD or VaD. In summary, T2DM increases the risk for AD through different mechanisms for VaD although some mechanisms may overlap. Tau-related neurofibrillary tangles instead of amyloid-β plaques are more likely to be the pathological biomarkers for T2DM-related dementia. Degeneration of neurons in the brain, impaired regional blood supply/metabolism, and genetic predisposition are all involved in T2DM-associated dementia or cognitive impairments.","2016",,"J Alzheimers Dis",," review","Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Databases, Bibliographic, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Dementia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Humans, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Based on human genetic association and meta-analysis, we first confirm the human VMAT2 (hVMAT2 or SLC18A2) promoter as a risk factor for PD in both family and unrelated US white people: marker rs363324 at -11.5 kb in the hVMAT2 promoter is reproducibly associated with PD in a cohort of nuclear families (p = 0.04506 in early-onset PD) and 3 unrelated US white people (meta-analysis p = 0.01879). In SH-SY5Y cells, low activity-associated hVMAT2 promoter confers high methylpiperidinopyrazole iodide cytotoxicity, which is likely attributed to functional polymorphisms bound by nuclear proteins. Interestingly, treatments with the dopamine neuron-protecting agent puerarin upregulates the promoter activity in a haplotype- and cell line-dependent manner.

The competing risk of death must be considered in the elderly because death and dementia have common risk factors. Moreover, in cohort studies, time-to-dementia is interval-censored since dementia is assessed intermittently. So subjects can develop dementia and die between two visits without being diagnosed. To study predementia cognitive decline, we propose a joint latent class model combining a (possibly multivariate) mixed model and an illness-death model handling both interval censoring (by accounting for a possible unobserved transition to dementia) and semi-competing risks. Parameters are estimated by maximum-likelihood handling interval censoring. The correlation between the marker and the times-to-events is captured by latent classes, homogeneous sub-groups with specific risks of death, dementia, and profiles of cognitive decline. We propose Markovian and semi-Markovian versions. Both approaches are compared to a joint latent-class model for competing risks through a simulation study, and applied in a prospective cohort study of cerebral and functional ageing to distinguish different profiles of cognitive decline associated with risks of dementia and death. The comparison highlights that among subjects with dementia, mortality depends more on age than on duration of dementia.

Presentation varies from acute limbic encephalitis to subacute or chronic disorders of cognition mimicking neurodegenerative dementia. It may occur as a paraneoplastic phenomenon or an idiopathic autoimmune phenomenon. The presence of a personal/family history of autoimmunity, inflammatory spinal fluid, serologic evidence of autoimmunity (neural or nonorgan-specific), or mesial temporal magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are clues to diagnosis. Bedside cognitive assessment and/or detailed neuropsychologic testing are useful. Neural-specific autoantibodies, mostly discovered in the past two decades, may bind antigens on the cell surface (e.g., N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor autoantibodies) and are likely to be pathogenic, with treatment aimed at antibody-depleting agents often with success, while antibodies binding intracellular antigens (e.g., antineuronal nuclear autoantibody type 1 (ANNA1 or anti-Hu)) are a marker of a T-cell-mediated process and treated with T-cell-depleting immunotherapies, with variable responses. Detection and treatment of cancer (when present) are essential. High-dose corticosteroids are the initial treatment in most patients and may serve as a diagnostic test when the diagnosis is uncertain. Repeat cognitive testing after immunotherapy helps document objective improvements. Maintenance immunotherapy is recommended in those at risk for relapse.

Elevated plasma level of copeptin has been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between copeptin and risk of dementia.
METHODS: In all, 18,240 individuals from Malmö, Sweden, were examined between 2002 and 2006 (mean age 69.3 years, 69.8% men). Incident cases of dementia until 31 December 2009 were identified by linkage with the Swedish National Patient Register. To validate the dementia diagnoses, medical records as well as laboratory and neuroimaging data were carefully reviewed. Baseline level of copeptin was measured in frozen plasma in: (1) all participants who were diagnosed with dementia during follow-up, (2) a random sample of 5100 individuals of the cohort.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 4.2 years, there were 374 incident dementia cases (age range 60-83 years at baseline): 120 were classified as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 84 as vascular dementia (VaD), and 102 as mixed dementia. In logistic regressions adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, baseline level of copeptin predicted incident VaD (Odds ratio (OR) 1.30 per 1 SD increase in log copeptin, 95% CI 1.03-1.64). Copeptin did not predict incidence of all-cause dementia (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94-1.18), AD (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79-1.18), or mixed dementia (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68-1.05).

Since glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity, ApoE genotypes and olfactory function are involved in both T2DM and AD pathogenesis, we investigate whether alterations of these factors can identify cognitive impairment in T2DM patients.
METHODS: The cognitive ability was evaluated using Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed by Petersen's criteria. GSK-3β activity in platelet, ApoE genotypes in leucocytes and the olfactory function were detected by Western/dot blotting, the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the biomarkers for MCI diagnosis were calculated by logistic regression. The diagnostic capability of the biomarkers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses.
FINDINGS: We recruited 694 T2DM patients from Jan. 2012 to May. 2015 in 5 hospitals (Wuhan), and 646 of them met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. 345 patients in 2 hospitals were assigned to the training set, and 301 patients in another 3 hospitals assigned to the validation set. Patients in each set were randomly divided into two groups: T2DM without MCI (termed T2DM-nMCI) or with MCI (termed T2DM-MCI). There were no significant differences for sex, T2DM years, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, complications, insulin treatment, HbA1c, ApoE ε2, ApoE ε3, tGSK3β and pS9GSK3β between the two groups. Compared with the T2DM-nMCI group, T2DM-MCI group showed lower MMSE score with older age, ApoE ε4 allele, higher olfactory score and higher rGSK-3β (ratio of total GSK-3β to Ser9-phosphorylated GSK-3β) in the training set and the validation set. The OR values of age, ApoE ε4 gene, olfactory score and rGSK-3β were 1.09, 2.09, 1.51, 10.08 in the training set, and 1.06, 2.67, 1.47, 7.19 in the validation set, respectively.

METHODS: Participants were survivors of first-ever, mild-to-moderate ischemic stroke or TIA from the TABASCO prospective cohort study who underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging and were examined by a multiprofessional team 6, 12, and 24 months after the event using direct interviews, depression scales, and neurologic, neuropsychological, and functional evaluations. The main outcome was the development of cognitive impairment, either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. MCI was diagnosed by a decline on at least 1 cognitive domain (≥ 1.5 SD) of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score and/or on the computerized neuropsychological battery, as compared with age- and education-matched published norms. Dementia was diagnosed by a consensus forum that included senior neurologists specializing in memory disorders and a neuropsychologist.
RESULTS: Data were obtained from 306 consecutive eligible patients (mean age: 67.1 ± 10.0 years) who were admitted to the department of emergency medicine at the Tel Aviv Medical Center from April 1, 2008, to December 1, 2011, within 72 hours from onset of symptoms of TIA or stroke. Of these patients, 51 (16.7%) developed cognitive impairment during a 2-year follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score ≥ 6 at admission and at 6 months after the event was a significant independent marker of cognitive impairment 2 years after the stroke/TIA (OR = 3.62, 95% CI, 1.01-13.00; OR = 3.68, 95% CI, 1.03-13.21, respectively). A higher GDS score at 6 months was also related to a worse functional outcome (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support depression screening among stroke and TIA survivors as a tool to identify patients who are prone to have a worse cognitive and functional outcome. These patients may benefit from closer medical surveillance and a more intensive treatment approach.

Our aim was to demonstrate that gradual and continuous WM change and the associated cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be captured by DTI parameters, which can be used to complement neuropsychological test scores in identifying patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without mild cognitive impairment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, divided into a group with mild cognitive impairment (n = 20) and a group with normal cognition (n = 22), were enrolled with age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (n = 26). 3T DTI followed by Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis was used to investigate the differences in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity (λ1), and radial diffusivity (λ23) among the groups. A receiver operating characteristic analysis assessed the performance of DTI parameters for separating the 2 groups with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS: The whole-brain Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis revealed that 7.3% and 24.9% of the WM exhibited decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity (P < .05), respectively, between the diabetes mellitus with mild cognitive impairment and the diabetes mellitus with normal cognition groups, while considerably larger WM regions showed fractional anisotropy (36.6%) and mean diffusivity (58.8%) changes between the diabetes mellitus with mild cognitive impairment and the healthy control groups. These changes were caused primarily by an elevated radial diffusivity observed in the patients with diabetes mellitus with mild cognitive impairment. Radial diffusivity also exhibited subtle but statistically significant changes between the diabetes mellitus with normal cognition and the healthy control groups. Analyses on individual fiber tracts showed pronounced fractional anisotropy reduction and mean diffusivity elevation in regions related to cognitive functions. The receiver operating characteristic analysis on the right cingulum (hippocampus) showed that fractional anisotropy produced a larger area under the curve (0.832) than mean diffusivity (0.753) for separating mild cognitive impairment from normal cognition among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. When fractional anisotropy was combined with mean diffusivity, the area under the curve was further improved to 0.857.
CONCLUSIONS: DTI parameters can show a substantial difference between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without mild cognitive impairment, suggesting their potential use as an imaging marker for detecting cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. More important, DTI parameters may capture gradual and continuous WM changes that can be associated with early stages of cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus before they can be diagnosed clinically by using conventional neuropsychological tests.","2016",,"AJNR Am J Neuroradiol","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have considerably higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Area Under Curve, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, ROC Curve, FALSE, White Matter, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In assessing physical activity, caloric expenditure is a proxy marker reflecting the sum total of multiple physical activity types conducted by an individual.
OBJECTIVE: To assess caloric expenditure, as a proxy marker of PA, as a predictive measure of gray matter (GM) volumes in the normal and cognitively impaired elderly persons.
METHODS: All subjects in this study were recruited from the Institutional Review Board approved Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a multisite population-based longitudinal study in persons aged 65 and older. We analyzed a sub-sample of CHS participants 876 subjects (mean age 78.3, 57.5% F, 42.5% M) who had i) energy output assessed as kilocalories (kcal) per week using the standardized Minnesota Leisure-Time Activities questionnaire, ii) cognitive assessments for clinical classification of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and iii) volumetric MR imaging of the brain. Voxel-based morphometry modeled the relationship between kcal/week and GM volumes while accounting for standard covariates including head size, age, sex, white matter hyperintensity lesions, MCI or AD status, and site. Multiple comparisons were controlled using a False Discovery Rate of 5 percent.
RESULTS: Higher energy output, from a variety of physical activity types, was associated with larger GM volumes in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. High levels of caloric expenditure moderated neurodegeneration-associated volume loss in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and cerebellar vermis.

Little is known about the possible role of ɛ4 in the association between ongoing episodic memory decline and olfactory deficits in the general population, but such information is relevant in determining the relevance of olfaction as a marker of DAT risk. The present study was based on a large, population-based sample (n=1087, aged 45-90 years, of which 324 were ɛ4-carriers). Episodic memory change rates were established using data collected every 5 years for a 10-20 year interval leading up to an olfactory assessment using the Scandinavian Odor Identification Test at the last wave of data collection. Participants were classified according to whether or not their episodic memory ability declined more rapidly than the age-typical norm (by >1SD). Our main result is that only in ɛ4-carriers was episodic memory decline associated with odor identification impairment. In individuals without ɛ4, odor identification was unrelated to episodic memory decline status. Follow-up analyses indicated that this moderation by ɛ4 was due to the olfactory nature of the identification test, and that the effect was not caused by 63 individuals with dementia. Our results suggest that the ɛ4 determines the functional association between ongoing episodic memory decline and olfaction. These findings are consistent with the notion that ɛ4-carriers with DAT, compared to non-carriers, display a cortical atrophy pattern that is more focused on mediotemporal lobe regions supporting olfactory and episodic memory functions. Olfactory and memory assessments might provide complementary information on mediotemporal atrophy prior to clinical dementia onset, but the ɛ4 should be considered when using olfactory assessment as an early-stage indicator.","2016",,"Neuropsychologia"," Little is known about the possible role of ɛ4 in the association between ongoing episodic memory decline and olfactory deficits in the general population , but such information is relevant in determining the relevance of olfaction as a marker of DAT risk ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Apolipoprotein E4, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Discrimination, Psychological, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Memory Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Memory, Episodic, TRUE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Odorants, FALSE, Olfaction Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Verbal Learning, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study among 268 patients with vascular risk factors but without parkinsonism or dementia (71.0 ± 7.8 years, 63% male). MPS was evaluated via Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III. Brain MRI was used to determine SVD (cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], lacunar infarctions [LIs], and white matter hyperintensities [WMH]). The presence of each SVD feature was indicated by the total SVD score. Logistic regression analyses were performed adjusting for age, sex, history of stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia.
RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, we found that the presence of CMBs, deep CMBs, mixed (in the basal ganglia and thalamus) LIs, periventricular hyperintensities (PVH), and deep WMH (DWMH), and total SVD score were significantly associated with MPS, whereas strictly lobar CMBs and other LIs (in strictly basal ganglia or strictly thalamus) were not. We also found a significant association between mixed LIs, PVH, DWMH and total SVD score and gait/balance function, between PVH and rigidity, and between mixed LIs and bradykinesia. Among elderly participants (≥73years), the association of total SVD score, deep CMBs, mixed LIs, and PVH, with MPS remained significant.

Helicobacter pylori (Hp) has been implicated as a risk factor of atherosclerosis for stroke and other cardiovascular disease, but limited data exist regarding vascular dementia (VD). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between Hp infection and carotid atherosclerosis in patients with VD.
METHODS: A total of 354 patients who were diagnosed with VD were enrolled. Patients were divided into Hp positive VD group (n=208) and Hp negative VD group (n=156) using the (13)C-urea breath test ((13)C-UBT). Serum YKL-40, a marker for inflammation, were analyzed by ELISA. Traditional atherosclerotic risk factors including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were collected or detected. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was determined by color Doppler ultrasound.
RESULTS: CIMT values and serum YKL-40 significantly increased in Hp positive VD group in comparison with Hp negative VD group (p<0.05). In Hp positive VD group, serum YKL-40 was positively correlated with CIMT (r=0.412, p<0.05), and the association was independent of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (β=0.381, p<0.001).

OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluated the relationship of coronary and other peripheral atherosclerosis to risk of death, dementia, and CHD in the very elderly. Because the extent of vascular disease differs substantially between men and women, sex- and race-specific analyses were included, with a specific focus on women with low coronary artery calcium (CAC) Agatston scores.
METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CAC, carotid intimal medial thickness, stenosis, and ankle brachial index) and risk of dementia, CHD, and total mortality in 532 participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study-Cognition Study from 1998/1999 (mean age, 80 years) to 2012/2013 (mean age, 93 years).
RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of participants had CAC scores >400. Women and African-Americans had lower CAC scores. Few men had low CAC scores. CAC score and number of coronary calcifications were directly related to age-adjusted total mortality and CHD. The age-specific incidence of dementia was higher than for CHD. Only about 25% of deaths were caused by CHD and 16% by dementia. Approximately 64% of those who died had a prior diagnosis of dementia. White women with low CAC scores had a significantly decreased incidence of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: In subjects 80+ years of age, there is a greater incidence of dementia than of CHD. CAC, as a marker of atherosclerosis, is a determinant of mortality, and risk of CHD and myocardial infarction. White women with low CAC scores had a significantly decreased risk of dementia.

METHODS: Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) participants underwent baseline olfactory testing with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Serial assessments included measures of motor symptoms, NMS, neuropsychological assessment, and CSF biomarkers. Up to three years follow-up data were included.
RESULTS: At baseline, worse olfaction (lowest tertile) was associated with more severe NMS, including anxiety and autonomic symptoms. Those in the lowest olfactory tertile were more likely to report cognitive impairment (37.4%) compared to those in the middle (24.4%) and highest olfactory tertiles (14.2%, p < 0.001). Aβ1-42 was significantly lower, and tau/Aβ1-42 ratio was higher in those with worse olfaction. In longitudinal analyses, lower UPSIT score was associated with greater decline in MoCA score (β = 0.02 [0.01, 0.03], p = 0.001) over time, as were composite measures of UPSIT score and either Aβ1-42 or tau/Aβ1-42 ratio. In a Cox proportional hazards model, a composite measure of olfaction and Aβ1-42 was a significant predictor of conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI; i.e., MoCA < 26), with subjects most impaired on both measures being 87% more likely to develop incident MCI (HR = 1.87 [1.16, 3.01], p = 0.01).

Whilst substantia nigra hyperechogenicity measured by transcranial B-mode sonography (TCS) represents a strong PD marker and is associated with an increased risk for PD in still healthy individuals, its association with cognitive performance in prodromal PD stages is not well established.
METHODS: Two different cohorts of healthy elderly individuals were assessed by TCS and two different neuropsychological test batteries covering executive functions, verbal memory, language, visuo-constructional function and attention. Cognitive performance was compared between individuals with hyperechogenicity (SN+) and without hyperechogenicity (SN-).

Uric acid is an oxidative stress marker. High uric acid blood levels have been associated with a reduced risk of PD and a decreased rate of disease progression. We investigated whether a low serum concentration of uric acid is also associated with PSP.
METHODS: We measured serum uric acid concentrations in a subsample of the ENGENE PSP Cohort that included 75 cases and 75 frequency-matched-by-sex healthy controls (69 spouses, 6 in-laws) from four centers willing to participate (Case Western, Rush University, University of Utah, and University of Louisville). Case severity was characterized using the total PSP-Rating Scale, UPDRS, and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. Unconditional logistic regression, Pearson's chi-squared test, and analysis of variance were used, as appropriate.
RESULTS: The mean uric acid level among cases (4.0 mg/dL) was not significantly lower than that of controls (4.1 mg/dL). When controlling for sex, there were no between-group statistical differences in uric acid levels. Uric acid levels were not correlated with disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not provide evidence of uric acid having a protective role in PSP, even if oxidative injury is important in the pathophysiology of this disorder.

METHODS: A total of 436 participants from the Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Cohort (RUN DMC), a prospective hospital-based cohort of elderly without dementia with cerebral SVD, were included in 2006. During follow-up (2011-2012), dementia was diagnosed. The structural network was constructed from baseline diffusion tensor imaging followed by deterministic tractography and measures of efficiency using graph theory were calculated. Cox proportional regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: During 5 years of follow-up, 32 patients developed dementia. MRI markers for SVD were strongly associated with network measures. Patients with dementia showed lower total network strength and global and local efficiency at baseline as compared with the group without dementia. Lower global network efficiency was independently associated with increased risk of incident all-cause dementia (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.96, p = 0.032); in contrast, individual SVD markers including lacunes, white matter hyperintensities volume, and atrophy were not independently associated.

This neuronal calcium sensor protein previously used as a marker of acute ischemic stroke is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients. The goal of this study was to assess CSF VILIP-1 potential in early AD diagnosis and in differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with and without risk of AD. Additionally, we tested VILIP-1 ability to differentiate AD from other primary causes of dementia, and predict the progression of AD-related cognitive decline. VILIP-1 levels were compared with five CSF AD biomarkers (t-tau, Aβ1-42, p-tau181, p-tau199, and p-tau231). VILIP-1 successfully differentiated two MCI patient groups characterized by absence or presence of pathological levels of these CSF biomarkers, except for t-tau. VILIP-1/Aβ(1-42) and VILIP-1/p-tau181 ratios also differentiated MCI patients with pathological CSF biomarker levels. However, there was no difference in VILIP-1 levels between AD and MCI patients. VILIP-1/Aβ(1-42) and VILIP-1/p-tau231 ratios reached high sensitivities (above 70%) and very high specificities (above 85%) in differentiating AD patients from HC. Additionally, VILIP-1 differentiated AD from patients with Lewy body disease with 77.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity. VILIP-1 potential as a prognostic biomarker of cognitive decline in AD was also proved since VILIP-1/t-tau, VILIP-1/p-tau181, and VILIP-1/p-tau231 ratios correlated with MMSE scores. These data indicate that VILIP-1 alone or in combination with other AD CSF biomarkers represent a valuable marker for the early diagnosis of AD, recognition of MCI patients at higher risk to develop dementia, and in differentiating AD from LBD.","2016",,"J Alzheimers Dis",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Diagnosis, Differential, TRUE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mental Status Schedule, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neurocalcin, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Peptide Fragments, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, ROC Curve, FALSE, Statistics as Topic, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Because mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage for dementia, we sought to evaluate whether changes in weight and body mass index (BMI) may predict incident MCI.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of change in weight and BMI with risk of MCI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based, prospective study of participants 70 years of age or older from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which was initiated on October 1, 2004. Maximum weight and height in midlife (40-65 years of age) were retrospectively ascertained from the medical records of participants using a medical records-linkage system. The statistical analyses were performed between January and November 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants were evaluated for cognitive outcomes of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia at baseline and prospectively assessed for incident events at each 15-month evaluation. The association of rate of change in weight and BMI with risk of MCI was investigated using proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 4.4 years, 524 of 1895 cognitively normal participants developed incident MCI (50.3% were men; mean age, 78.5 years). The mean (SD) rate of weight change per decade from midlife to study entry was greater for participants who developed incident MCI vs those who remained cognitively normal (-2.0 [5.1] vs -1.2 [4.9] kg; P = .006). A greater decline in weight per decade was associated with an increased risk of incident MCI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.06]; P < .001) after adjusting for sex, education, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A weight loss of 5 kg per decade corresponds to a 24% increase in risk of MCI (HR, 1.24). A higher decrease in BMI per decade was also associated with incident MCI (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.03-1.13]; P = .003).

The progression from MCI to dementia is insidious with no definite demarcation, thus making diagnosis clinically difficult at an early stage. This paper attempts to throw light on the epidemiology, risk factors and the aetiopathogenesis of MCI. It further attempts to elaborate on the rate of conversion of MCI to definite dementia and the factors influencing the same.

Homocysteine, a sulphur containing amino-acid has been identified as a probable risk factor for the dementia spectrum. Various existing clinical evidences and biological plausibility towards probable link between homocysteine and dementia are discussed in this paper.

Growing evidence suggests the human cortex is essentially contributing to the control of standing balance. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear and need further investigation. In a previous study, we introduced a new protocol to identify electrocortical activity associated with performance of different continuous balance tasks with the eyes opened. The aim of this study was to extend our previous results by investigating the individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF), a neurophysiological marker of thalamo-cortical information transmission, which remained unconsidered so far in balance research. Thirty-seven subjects completed nine balance tasks varying in surface stability and base of support. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 32 scalp locations throughout balancing with the eyes closed to ensure reliable identification of the iAPF. Balance performance was quantified as the sum of anterior-posterior and medio-lateral movements of the supporting platform. The iAPF, as well as power in the theta, lower alpha and upper alpha frequency bands were determined for each balance task after applying an ICA-based artifact rejection procedure. Higher demands on balance control were associated with a global increase in iAPF and a decrease in lower alpha power. These results may indicate increased thalamo-cortical information transfer and general cortical activation, respectively. In addition, a significant increase in upper alpha activity was observed in the fronto-central region whereas it decreased in the centro-parietal region. Furthermore, midline theta increased with higher task demands probably indicating activation of error detection/processing mechanisms. IAPF as well as theta and alpha power were correlated with platform movements. The results provide new insights into spectral and spatial characteristics of cortical oscillations subserving balance control. This information may be particularly useful in a clinical context as it could be used to reveal cortical contributions to balance dysfunction in specific populations such as Parkinson's or vestibular loss. However, this should be addressed in future studies.","2015",,"Front Hum Neurosci"," The aim of this study was to extend our previous results by investigating the individual alpha peak frequency ( iAPF ) , a neurophysiological marker of thalamo-cortical information transmission , which remained unconsidered so far in balance research ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Despite of its ubiquitous expression in brain, its roles in non-neuronal cells such as neural stem cells (NSCs) and astrocytes were poorly unknown.
RESULTS: We show that PINK1 expression increases from embryonic day 12 to postnatal day 1 in mice, which represents the main period of brain development. PINK1 expression also increases during neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. Interestingly, expression of GFAP (a marker of astrocytes) was lower in PINK1 knockout (KO) mouse brain lysates compared to wild-type (WT) lysates at postnatal days 1-8, whereas there was little difference in the expression of markers for other brain cell types (e.g., neurons and oligodendrocytes). Further experiments showed that PINK1-KO NSCs were defective in their differentiation to astrocytes, producing fewer GFAP-positive cells compared to WT NSCs. However, the KO and WT NSCs did not differ in their self-renewal capabilities or ability to differentiate to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, during differentiation of KO NSCs there were no defects in mitochondrial function, and there were not changes in signaling molecules such as SMAD1/5/8, STAT3, and HES1 involved in differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes. In brain sections, GFAP-positive astrocytes were more sparsely distributed in the corpus callosum and substantia nigra of KO animals compared with WT.

Apart from age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, there are currently no established, clinically relevant, noninvasive markers of dementia. We conducted a literature search of recent observational epidemiological studies evaluating the relevance of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoproteins as biomarkers of future and prevalent risk of dementia.
RECENT FINDINGS: HDL-C and apolipoproteins, such as apoE have been suggested to play important roles in brain function and have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease in observational studies. However, findings have been inconsistent, especially across study designs. In recent years, modern proteomic approaches have enabled the investigation of further apolipoproteins involved in the deposition and clearance of β-amyloid, a determining factor for subsequent neurodegeneration.
SUMMARY: Associations in cross-sectional studies are not always indicative of a prospective relationship. Large studies find that plasma HDL-C and apoE are inversely associated with dementia. Higher apoJ levels might be a marker of prevalent dementia, but were not associated with risk of future dementia. The investigation of HDL-C and apolipoproteins in relation to dementia represents an area of opportunity. Additional prospective studies that account for potential confounding factors and that explore potential effect modifiers such as APOE genotype and sex are needed to fully investigate the potential of these noninvasive measures in disease prediction.","2016",,"Curr Opin Lipidol"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Dementia is a major cause of disability and institutionalization "," review","Animals, FALSE, Apolipoproteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cholesterol, HDL, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common nonevasive and nonexpensive technique that can easily be used in clinical settings to identify brain functional abnormalities. Only few studies had identified EEG abnormalities that can predict PD patients at higher risk for dementia. Brain connectivity EEG measures, such as multiscale entropy (MSE) and phase-locking value (PLV) analyses, may be more informative and sensitive to brain alterations leading to dementia than previously used methods. This study followed 62 dementia-free PD patients for a mean of 3.4 years to identify cerebral alterations that are associated with dementia. Baseline resting state EEG of patients who developed dementia (N = 18) was compared to those of patients who remained dementia-free (N = 44) and of 37 healthy subjects. MSE and PLV analyses were performed. Partial least squares statistical analysis revealed group differences associated with the development of dementia. Patients who developed dementia showed higher signal complexity and lower PLVs in low frequencies (mainly in delta frequency) than patients who remained dementia-free and controls. Conversely, both patient groups showed lower signal variability and higher PLVs in high frequencies (mainly in gamma frequency) compared to controls, with the strongest effect in patients who developed dementia. These findings suggest that specific disruptions of brain communication can be measured before PD patients develop dementia, providing a new potential marker to identify patients at highest risk of developing dementia and who are the best candidates for neuroprotective trials.","2016",,"Brain Connect",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Brain Waves, FALSE, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Connectome, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Electroencephalography, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: Structural equation modeling of associations of risk factors with the anxiety outcome using a cross-sectional data set of 342 patients with PD were used.
RESULTS: A model with acceptable to good fit was generated that explained 65% of the variance in anxiety scores. A previous history of depression and the severity of the depressive symptoms scored on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were the only nonspecific variables with a direct effect on anxiety. The presence of motor fluctuations and disease-related decline in activities of daily living were PD-specific markers of anxiety. Nonspecific risk factors had a greater influence in the model than PD-specific risk factors. Standardized regression coefficients suggested that the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was the most important contributor to the variation in anxiety. A post-hoc analysis showed that the effects of the following variables on anxiety levels were fully mediated by depression: sex; family history of depression; previous history of anxiety; cognitive status; difficulties in non-disease-specific activities of daily living; and severity of motor signs.
CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional study, we showed that nonspecific general population risk factors are more important markers for anxiety than PD-specific risk factors.

Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), a key player in lipid metabolism, is recognized as one of the most powerful genetic risk factors for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, the current understanding of APOE polymorphism in various neurological disorders is discussed. METHODS The English literature was searched for various studies describing the role of APOE polymorphism as a prognostic marker in neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury. The wide ethnic distribution of APOE polymorphism was discussed, and the recent meta-analyses of role of APOE polymorphism in multiple diseases were analyzed and summarized in tabular form. RESULTS Results from the review of literature revealed that the distribution of APOE is varied in different ethnic populations. APOE polymorphism plays a significant role in pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. APOE ε4 is considered a marker for poor prognosis in various diseases, but APOE ε2 rather than APOE ε4 has been associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related bleeding and sporadic Parkinson's disease. The role of APOE polymorphism in various neurological diseases has not been conclusively elucidated. CONCLUSIONS Apo-E is a biomarker for various neurological and systemic diseases. Therefore, while analyzing the role of APOE polymorphism in neurological diseases, the interpretation should be done after adjusting all the confounding factors.

The underlying disease pathology is heterogeneous and not yet well characterized. Biomarkers for cognitive impairment in PD could aid in diagnostic and prognostic evaluation and in the development of new cognitive enhancing treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between CSF markers and cognition in a large, multicenter, cohort study of early, untreated PD, and compare marker concentrations between PD patients with and without MCI and healthy, age-matched controls.
METHODS: 414 early, untreated PD (34% with mild cognitive impairment) and 189 healthy, cognitively intact controls with baseline neuropsychological testing and CSF abeta42, t-tau, p-tau181 and α-synuclein results were included. Multiple linear regression models were constructed with a composite cognition factor, or memory-, or visuospatial- or executive-attention domains as dependent variables, and CSF markers, demographic characteristics and MDS-UPDRS III score as predictors.
RESULTS: Lower α-synuclein was associated with reduced performance on the executive-attention domain and the composite cognition factor in the whole PD-group. Abeta42 was significantly decreased in PD with mild cognitive impairment compared with controls after adjusting for covariates, while values in PD without MCI were identical to healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between reduced CSF α-synuclein concentrations and cognition suggests that α-synuclein pathology contributes to early cognitive impairment in PD, in particular to executive-attentional dysfunction.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We determined CVR in nondemented participants who underwent transcranial Doppler with induced hypercapnia from 1997 to 1999, as part of the ongoing population-based Rotterdam Study. We used a Cox model to determine the risk of dementia in relation to CVR, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and carotid intima-media thickness. We furthermore determined decline on a cognitive test battery in relation to CVR, using linear mixed models. Among 1629 participants (mean ± SD age 70.6 ± 6.2 years, 46.2% female) with a mean follow-up of 11.5 years, 209 were diagnosed with dementia, of whom 171 had Alzheimer disease. Higher CVR at baseline was associated with lower risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval, per SD increase: 0.87, 0.75-1.00) and Alzheimer disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 0.71-0.99). This association was more profound in APOEε4 carriers than in noncarriers (adjusted hazard ratio for all dementia: 0.77, 0.60-0.98 versus 0.89, 0.73-1.07). Performance on cognitive tests at baseline was better with higher CVR (g-factor: P=0.02), but during 3 cognitive assessments over 11 years of follow-up, higher CVR at baseline was associated with less decline in test scores on the Stroop reading and interference tasks in APOEε4 carriers only (P=0.01 and 0.02, respectively).

Sepsis-induced delirium (SID) is the most frequent cause of delirium in ICU (Martin et al., 2010). Together delirium and SID represent under-recognized public health problems which place an increasing financial burden on the US health care system, currently estimated at 143-152 billion dollars per year (Leslie et al., 2008). The interest in SID was recently reignited as it was demonstrated that, contrary to prior beliefs, cognitive deficits induced by this condition may be irreversible and lead to dementia (Pandharipande et al., 2013; Brummel et al., 2014). Conversely, it is construed that diagnosing SID early or mitigating its full blown manifestations may preempt geriatric cognitive disorders. Biological markers specific for sepsis and SID would facilitate the development of potential therapies, monitor the disease process and at the same time enable elderly individuals to make better informed decisions regarding surgeries which may pose the risk of complications, including sepsis and delirium. This article proposes a battery of peripheral blood markers to be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in sepsis and SID. Though each individual marker may not be specific enough, we believe that together as a battery they may achieve the necessary accuracy to answer two important questions: who may be vulnerable to the development of sepsis, and who may develop SID and irreversible cognitive deficits following sepsis?","2015",,"Front Mol Biosci"," This article proposes a battery of peripheral blood markers to be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in sepsis and SID ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Olfactory impairment may be an important clinical marker and predictor of these conditions and may help identify persons at increased risk.
OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of impaired olfaction with incident MCI subtypes and progression from MCI subtypes to AD dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants enrolled in the population-based, prospective Mayo Clinic Study of Aging between 2004 and 2010 were clinically evaluated at baseline and every 15 months through 2014. Participants (N = 1630) were classified as having normal cognition, MCI (amnestic MCI [aMCI] and nonamnestic MCI [naMCI]), and dementia. We administered the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) to assess olfactory function.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, and longitudinal change in cognitive performance measures.
RESULTS: Of the 1630 participants who were cognitively normal at the time of the smell test, 33 died before follow-up and 167 were lost to follow-up. Among the 1430 cognitively normal participants included, the mean (SD) age was 79.5 (5.3) years, 49.4% were men, the mean duration of education was 14.3 years, and 25.4% were APOE ε4 carriers. Over a mean 3.5 years of follow-up, there were 250 incident cases of MCI among 1430 cognitively normal participants. We observed an association between decreasing olfactory identification, as measured by a decrease in the number of correct responses in B-SIT score, and an increased risk of aMCI. Compared with the upper B-SIT quartile (quartile [Q] 4, best scores), hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) were 1.12 (0.65-1.92) for Q3 (P = .68); 1.95 (1.25-3.03) for Q2 (P = .003); and 2.18 (1.36-3.51) for Q1 (P = .001) (worst scores; P for trend <.001) after adjustment for sex and education, with age as the time scale. There was no association with naMCI. There were 64 incident dementia cases among 221 prevalent MCI cases. The B-SIT score also predicted progression from aMCI to AD dementia, with a significant dose-response with worsening B-SIT quartiles. Compared with Q4, HR (95% CI) estimates were 3.02 (1.06-8.57) for Q3 (P = .04); 3.63 (1.19-11.10) for Q2 (P = .02); and 5.20 (1.90-14.20) for Q1 (P = .001). After adjusting for key predictors of MCI risk, B-SIT (as a continuous measure) remained a significant predictor of MCI (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.04-1.16]; P < .001) and improved the model concordance.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Olfactory impairment is associated with incident aMCI and progression from aMCI to AD dementia. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported associations of olfactory impairment with cognitive impairment in late life and suggest that olfactory tests have potential utility for screening for MCI and MCI that is likely to progress.","2016",,"JAMA Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : To examine associations of impaired olfaction with incident MCI subtypes and progression from MCI subtypes to AD dementia ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Amnesia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Olfaction Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Population Surveillance, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

However, their prognostic utility to predict the onset of dementia in predementia subjects is still questioned. We aimed to study the prospective clinical evolution of a group of subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to determine the prognostic capacity of AD CSF biomarkers.
METHODS: 149 subjects with MCI or SCD, not meeting dementia criteria, underwent a prospective clinical, neuropsychological and CSF biomarker study. Patients were initially classified as SCD or MCI following internationally accepted criteria. CSF sampling was obtained and analysed following consensus protocols. Neuropsychological and clinical evaluations were conducted at the follow-up. Statistical analysis considering the final clinical diagnosis, regression analysis to define risk factors and survival curves for progression were made.
RESULTS: 72.4% of subjects (83% MCI and 27% SCD) with a pathological CSF ratio (Aβ42/p-tau) met criteria for dementia during the 5-year follow-up versus 18.7% of subjects from the group with a normal ratio. The pathological CSF ratio was a powerful marker of risk for AD dementia (OR 27.1; 95% CI 10.3-71.2). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that only 15% of subjects with a pathological CSF ratio remained free of AD dementia at 5 years of follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of early specialist referral for dementia on the risk of institutionalization and functional decline in Activity of Daily Living (ADL).
METHODS: Incident dementia cases were screened in a prospective population-based cohort, the Three-City Study, and initial specialist consultation for cognitive complaint was assessed at dementia diagnosis. Proportional hazard regression and illness-death models were used to test the association between specialist referral and, respectively, institutionalization and functional decline.
RESULTS: Only one third of the incident individuals with dementia had consulted a specialist for cognitive problems early (36%). After adjustment on potential confounders (including cognitive and functional decline) and competing risk of death, participants who had consulted a specialist early in the disease course presented a higher rate of being institutionalized than those who did not (Hazard Ratio = 2.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.09- 3.64). But early specialist referral was not associated with further functional decline (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.71- 1.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Early specialist referral in dementia is associated with increased risk of institutionalization but not with functional decline in ADL.

Prodromal disease refers to the stage wherein early symptoms or signs of PD neurodegeneration are present, but classic clinical diagnosis based on fully evolved motor parkinsonism is not yet possible. Given the lack of clear neuroprotective/disease-modifying therapy for prodromal PD, these criteria were developed for research purposes only. The criteria are based upon the likelihood of prodromal disease being present with probable prodromal PD defined as ≥80% certainty. Certainty estimates rely upon calculation of an individual's risk of having prodromal PD, using a Bayesian naïve classifier. In this methodology, a previous probability of prodromal disease is delineated based upon age. Then, the probability of prodromal PD is calculated by adding diagnostic information, expressed as likelihood ratios. This diagnostic information combines estimates of background risk (from environmental risk factors and genetic findings) and results of diagnostic marker testing. In order to be included, diagnostic markers had to have prospective evidence documenting ability to predict clinical PD. They include motor and nonmotor clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and ancillary diagnostic tests. These criteria represent a first step in the formal delineation of early stages of PD and will require constant updating as more information becomes available.","2015",,"Mov Disord"," Given the lack of clear neuroprotective / disease-modifying therapy for prodromal PD , these criteria were developed for research purposes only "," review","Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Prodromal Symptoms, TRUE, Severity of Illness Index, TRUE, Societies, Scientific, FALSE, standards, Q000592",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Speech is an important indicator of motor function and movement coordination, and therefore may be an extremely sensitive early marker of changes due to prodromal neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Speech data were acquired from 16 RBD subjects and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Objective acoustic assessment of 15 speech dimensions representing various phonatory, articulatory, and prosodic deviations was performed. Statistical models were applied to characterise speech disorders in RBD and to estimate sensitivity and specificity in differentiating between RBD and control subjects.
RESULTS: Some form of speech impairment was revealed in 88% of RBD subjects. Articulatory deficits were the most prominent findings in RBD. In comparison to controls, the RBD group showed significant alterations in irregular alternating motion rates (p = 0.009) and articulatory decay (p = 0.01). The combination of four distinctive speech dimensions, including aperiodicity, irregular alternating motion rates, articulatory decay, and dysfluency, led to 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity in discriminating between RBD and control subjects. Speech impairment was significantly more pronounced in RBD subjects with the motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale greater than 4 points when compared to other RBD individuals.

We tested whether hippocampal metabolite ratios are associated with contrasting levels of air pollution, APOE, and body mass index (BMI) in paired healthy children and one parent sharing the same APOE alleles. We used 1H-MRS to interrogate bilateral hippocampal single-voxel in 57 children (12.45 ± 3.4 years) and their 48 parents (37.5 ± 6.78 years) from a low pollution city versus Mexico City (MC). NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr metabolite ratios were analyzed. The right hippocampus NAA/Cr ratio was significantly different between cohorts (p = 0.007). The NAA/Cr ratio in right hippocampus in controls versus APOE ɛ4 MC children and in left hippocampus in MC APOE ɛ4 parents versus their children was significantly different after adjusting for age, gender, and BMI (p = 0.027 and 0.01, respectively). The NAA/Cr ratio is considered reflective of neuronal density/functional integrity/loss of synapses/higher pTau burden, thus a significant decrease in hippocampal NAA/Cr ratios may constitute a spectral marker of early neurodegeneration in young urbanites. Decreases in NAA/Cr correlate well with cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, and dementia severity; thus, since the progression of AD starts decades before clinical diagnosis, our findings support the hypothesis that under chronic exposures to fine particulate matter and ozone above the standards, neurodegenerative processes start in childhood and APOE ɛ4 carriers are at higher risk.

This idea is supported by the growing evidence that SCD is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and increases the risk of future cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, this evidence is not complete, since other studies have not found these associations. This discrepancy could have a methodological basis. It is well known that across the broad spectrum of degenerative disease from healthy controls to dementia, the research setting affects key characteristics of the sample such as age, educational level, or family history of dementia. However, virtually no studies have specifically tested the influence of sampling and recruitment methods in SCD research. Population-based samples are less biased and therefore they probably are more suitable for the study of memory complaints as a symptom at the population level. On the other hand, the memory clinic setting could introduce a set of biases that make these patients more likely to develop cognitive impairment. Thus, memory clinic would be the most cost-effective context in which to study the phenomenology of SCD due to AD and eventually recruit patients for secondary prevention trials. However, this general hypothesis needs to be tested. Studies that compare samples of patients with SCD from different settings are necessary.

METHODS: LRP was analyzed in 304 subjects in the Vantaa 85+ sample from Southern Finland. The GWAS included 41 cases with midbrain, hippocampal, and neocortical LRP and 177 controls without midbrain and hippocampal LRP. The Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) material was used for replication (51 cases and 131 controls).
RESULTS: By analyzing 327,010 markers the top signal was obtained at the HLA-DPA1/DPB1 locus (P = 1.29 × 10(-7)); five other loci on chromosomes 15q14, 2p21, 2q31, 18p11, and 5q23 were associated with neocortical LRP at P < 10(-5). Two loci were marked by multiple markers, 2p21 (P = 3.9 × 10(-6), upstream of the SPTBN1 gene), and HLA-DPA1/DPB1; these were tested in the CFAS material. Single marker (P = 0.0035) and haplotype (P = 0.04) associations on 2p21 were replicated in CFAS, whereas HLA-DPA1/DPB1 association was not.

Multiple causes of clinical progression are indeed usually observed, and multiple longitudinal markers are collected when the true latent trait of interest is hard to capture (e.g., quality of life, functional dependency, and cognitive level). These multivariate and longitudinal data also usually have nonstandard distributions (discrete, asymmetric, bounded, etc.). We propose a joint model based on a latent process and latent classes to analyze simultaneously such multiple longitudinal markers of different natures, and multiple causes of progression. A latent process model describes the latent trait of interest and links it to the observed longitudinal outcomes using flexible measurement models adapted to different types of data, and a latent class structure links the longitudinal and cause-specific survival models. The joint model is estimated in the maximum likelihood framework. A score test is developed to evaluate the assumption of conditional independence of the longitudinal markers and each cause of progression given the latent classes. In addition, individual dynamic cumulative incidences of each cause of progression based on the repeated marker data are derived.

Accumulated evidence suggests that abundant intracellular expression of α-synuclein is one of the risk factors for pathological aggregation. Recently, we reported differential expression patterns of α-synuclein between excitatory and inhibitory hippocampal neurons. Here we further investigated the precise expression profile in the adult mouse brain with special reference to vulnerable regions along the progression of idiopathic PD. The results show that α-synuclein was highly expressed in the neuronal cell bodies of some early PD-affected brain regions, such as the olfactory bulb, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and substantia nigra pars compacta. Synaptic expression of α-synuclein was mostly accompanied by expression of vesicular glutamate transporter-1, an excitatory presynaptic marker. In contrast, expression of α-synuclein in the GABAergic inhibitory synapses was different among brain regions. α-Synuclein was clearly expressed in inhibitory synapses in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata, but not in the cerebral cortex, subthalamic nucleus, or thalamus. These results suggest that some neurons in early PD-affected human brain regions express high levels of perikaryal α-synuclein, as happens in the mouse brain.

Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is widely used as a clinical marker of overall endothelial function. We evaluated the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and FMD in PD. We enrolled 81 patients with early PD and 52 healthy controls, and we evaluate endothelial function based on vitamin D status and identify the association between FMD and vitamin D status in patients with early PD. The mean serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the PD patients than in the controls (21.8 ± 9.5 vs. 25.2 ± 9.3 ng/mL, p < 0.05). FMD was significantly lower in the PD patients (7.1 ± 1.8 %) than in the controls (8.1 ± 2.1 %, p < 0.05). The serum 25(OH)D was significantly associated with FMD independently of age, cardiovascular disease risk factors, body mass index, motor Unified PD Rating Scale status and homocysteine levels (adjusted R (2) = 0.331, β = 0.494, p < 0.001).

Asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carriers (aLRRK2+), at high risk for developing PD, provide an opportunity for the study of preclinical biomarkers.
OBJECTIVE: To assess SN echogenicity and other echographic features in LRRK2 G2019S carriers and their clinical and imaging correlates.
METHODS: Transcranial sonography was performed in 26 LRRK2 G2019S PD patients, 50 first-degree relatives, 31 idiopathic PD (IPD) patients and 26 controls. SN echogenicity and other echographic features were assessed in all study subjects. Dopamine transporter imaging (DAT-SPECT) was performed in 29 first-degree relatives.
RESULTS: 75% of the LRRK2-PD and 87.5% of the IPD showed SN+ (p = 0.087). aLRRK2+ had a higher frequency of SN+ than non carriers (58.3% vs. 25%, p = 0.039) and controls (58.3% vs. 12.5%; p = 0.002) and had a larger area of SN echogenicity than non carriers (p = 0.030) and controls (p < 0.001). The width of the third ventricle was significantly lower in LRRK2-PD than in IPD (1.9 mm [1.38; 2.75] vs. 3.0 mm [2.3; 5.3]; p = 0.003). Four out of 5 (80%) of the aLRRK2+ with an abnormal DAT-SPECT and four of the 5 (80%) of those with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) had SN+.
CONCLUSIONS: SN+ is very frequent in LRRK2-PD and aLRRK2+. Most aLRRK2 with possible surrogate markers of PD such as abnormal DAT-SPECT or RBD, also had SN+, which supports that this echofeature might be a marker of PD in these asymptomatic population.","2015",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord"," OBJECTIVE : To assess SN echogenicity and other echographic features in LRRK2 G2019S carriers and their clinical and imaging correlates ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Female, FALSE, Genetic Markers, FALSE, Heterozygote, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutation, TRUE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, FALSE, Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial, FALSE, Young Adult, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

While mobility disorder is universal at a high burden of frailty, neither mobility nor balance dysfunction is sufficient to fully define frailty. Frailty represents proximity to complex system failure, with higher-order disturbance, such as mobility and balance disturbance, as a consequence. Impairment of mobility and balance is a common manifestation of illness in the frail individual and is therefore a sensitive marker of acute disease, putatively also in delirium. Clinical measurement of mobility and balance should be prioritized. Consequently, assessment tools, such as the de Morton Mobility Index and the Hierarchical Assessment of Balance and Mobility, are being explored, with the sensitivity of the latter illustrated in the acute hospital setting. Walking with speed and under dual/multi-task conditions better differentiates healthier and frail ambulant adults, providing a basis for screening older adults for pre-emptive interventions. Specific mobility and balance interventions reduce falls risk. However, patients with dementia walk too fast for their level of frailty, creating an ethical dimension to rehabilitation and risk. Overall, there is no need for reduced mobility to reinforce the frailty stereotype; both are potentially modifiable and amenable to intervention strategies.","2015",,"Interdiscip Top Gerontol Geriatr",," review","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Dementia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Disability Evaluation, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Frail Elderly, FALSE, psychology, Q000523, Geriatric Assessment, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mobility Limitation, TRUE, Postural Balance, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Quality of Life, TRUE, Risk Assessment, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The pathology of HAND gets more complicated with the recreational drug use such as cocaine. Recent studies have suggested multiple genetic influences involved in the pathology of addiction and HAND but only a fraction of the entire genetic risk has been investigated so far. In this regard, role of DJ1 protein (a gene linked to autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease) in regulating dopamine (DA) transmission and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in neuronal cells will be worth investigating in HIV-1 and cocaine exposed microenvironment. Being a very abundant protein in the brain, DJ1 could serve as a potential marker for early detection of HIV-1 and/or cocaine related neurological disorder.
METHODS: In vitro analysis was done to observe the effect of HIV-1 and/or cocaine on DJ1 protein expression in neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-MC). Gene and protein expression analysis of DJ1 was done on the HIV infected and/or cocaine treated SK-N-MC and compared to untreated cells using real time PCR, Western Blot and flow cytometry. Effect of DJ1 dysregulation on oxidative stress was analyzed by measuring ROS production in these cells.
RESULTS: Gene expression and protein analysis indicated that there was a significant decrease in DJ1 expression in SK-N-MC chronically exposed to HIV-1 and/or cocaine which is inversely proportional to ROS production.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to establish that DJ1 expression level in the neuronal cells significantly decreased in presence of HIV-1 and/or cocaine indicating oxidative stress level of DA neurons.","2015",,"Front Microbiol",,"other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We aimed to create a non-invasive, accurate classification model for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, which could serve as a basis for future disease prediction studies in longitudinal cohorts.
METHODS: We developed a model for disease classification using data from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) study for 367 patients with Parkinson's disease and phenotypically typical imaging data and 165 controls without neurological disease. Olfactory function, genetic risk, family history of Parkinson's disease, age, and gender were algorithmically selected by stepwise logistic regression as significant contributors to our classifying model. We then tested the model with data from 825 patients with Parkinson's disease and 261 controls from five independent cohorts with varying recruitment strategies and designs: the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP), the Parkinson's Associated Risk Study (PARS), 23andMe, the Longitudinal and Biomarker Study in PD (LABS-PD), and the Morris K Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center of Excellence cohort (Penn-Udall). Additionally, we used our model to investigate patients who had imaging scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD).
FINDINGS: In the population from PPMI, our initial model correctly distinguished patients with Parkinson's disease from controls at an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·923 (95% CI 0·900-0·946) with high sensitivity (0·834, 95% CI 0·711-0·883) and specificity (0·903, 95% CI 0·824-0·946) at its optimum AUC threshold (0·655). All Hosmer-Lemeshow simulations suggested that when parsed into random subgroups, the subgroup data matched that of the overall cohort. External validation showed good classification of Parkinson's disease, with AUCs of 0·894 (95% CI 0·867-0·921) in the PDBP cohort, 0·998 (0·992-1·000) in PARS, 0·955 (no 95% CI available) in 23andMe, 0·929 (0·896-0·962) in LABS-PD, and 0·939 (0·891-0·986) in the Penn-Udall cohort. Four of 17 SWEDD participants who our model classified as having Parkinson's disease converted to Parkinson's disease within 1 year, whereas only one of 38 SWEDD participants who were not classified as having Parkinson's disease underwent conversion (test of proportions, p=0·003).
INTERPRETATION: Our model provides a potential new approach to distinguish participants with Parkinson's disease from controls. If the model can also identify individuals with prodromal or preclinical Parkinson's disease in prospective cohorts, it could facilitate identification of biomarkers and interventions.

METHODS: A total of 30 patients with PD without dementia or depression were divided into 3 matched groups (dyskinetic, nondyskinetic, and drug-naive) for this study. We acquired 2 PET scans and 3T MRI for each patient using [(11)C]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile ((11)C-DASB) and N-(3-[(18)F]fluoropropyl)-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane ((18)F-FP-CIT). Then we analyzed binding potentials of the 2 radiotracers at basal ganglia structures and correlations with clinical variables.
RESULTS: We observed no difference in (18)F-FP-CIT binding between dyskinetic and nondyskinetic patients, whereas there were differences in (11)C-DASB binding for the caudate and putamen. Binding potential ratios ((11)C-DASB/(18)F-FP-CIT) at the putamen, which indicate serotoninergic fiber innervation relative to dopaminergic fiber availability, were highest in the dyskinetic group, followed by the nondyskinetic and drug-naive PD groups. (11)C-DASB/(18)F-FP-CIT ratios at the putamen and pallidum correlated positively with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total scores and duration of PD, and pallidal binding ratio also correlated with the UPDRS motor scores. Ratios were not dependent on dopaminergic medication dosages for any of the regions studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative serotonergic innervation of the putamen and pallidum increased with clinical PD progression and was highest in patients with established dyskinesia.

The main purpose of this study was to examine the associations between hippocampal volume, mean diffusivity (MD) and connectivity and cognitive state following stroke. Eighty three consecutive first ever mild to moderate stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) survivors from our ongoing prospective TABASCO (Tel Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort) study underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans within 7 days of stroke onset. Hippocampal volume was measured from T1 weighted images, hippocampal mean diffusivity was calculated from diffusion tensor imaging and connectivity was calculated from resting state fMRI. Global cognitive assessments were evaluated during hospitalization and 6 and 12 months later using a computerized neuropsychological battery. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test which of the hippocampi measurements best predict cognitive state. All three imaging parameters were significantly correlated to each other (|r's| >0.3, P's < 0.005), and with cognitive state 6 and 12 months after the event. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated the predictive role of hippocampal mean diffusivity (β = -0.382, P = 0.026) on cognitive state, above and beyond that of volume and connectivity of this structure. To our knowledge, the combination of hippocampal volume, mean diffusivity and connectivity in first ever post stroke or TIA patients has not yet been considered in relation to cognitive state.

Cerebral microbleeds are associated with cognitive deficits, but the mechanism is unclear. Studies show that individuals with CMBs related to symptomatic cerebral amyloid angiopathy have abnormal vascular reactivity and cerebral blood flow (CBF), but, to our knowledge, abnormalities in cerebral blood flow have not been reported for healthy individuals with incidental CMBs.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of incidental CMBs with resting-state CBF, cerebral metabolism, cerebrovascular disease, β-amyloid (Aβ), and cognition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study of 55 cognitively normal individuals with a mean (SD) age of 86.8 (2.7) years was conducted from May 1, 2010, to May 1, 2013, in an academic medical center in Pittsburgh; data analysis was performed between June 10, 2013, and April 9, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS: 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging was performed with susceptibility-weighted imaging or gradient-recalled echo to assess CMBs, arterial spin labeling for CBF, and T1- and T2-weighted imaging for atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, and infarcts. Positron emission tomography was conducted with fluorodeoxyglucose to measure cerebral metabolism and Pittsburgh compound B for fibrillar Aβ. Neuropsychological evaluation, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, was performed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Magnetic resonance images were rated for the presence and location of CMBs. Lobar CMBs were subclassified as cortical or subcortical. Measurements of CBF, metabolism, and Aβ were compared with the presence and number of CMBs with voxelwise and region-of-interest analyses.
RESULTS: The presence of cortical CMBs was associated with significantly reduced CBF in multiple regions on voxelwise and region-of-interest analyses (percentage difference in global CBF, -25.3%; P = .0003), with the largest reductions in the parietal cortex (-37.6%; P < .0001) and precuneus (-31.8%; P = .0006). Participants with any CMBs showed a nonsignificant trend toward reduced CBF. Participants with cortical CMBs had a significant association with greater prevalence of infarcts (24% vs 6%; P = .047) and demonstrated a trend to greater prevalence of deficits demonstrated on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (45% vs 19%; P = .12). There was no difference in cortical amyloid (measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography) between participants with and without CMBs (P = .60).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In cognitively normal elderly individuals, incidental CMBs in cortical locations are associated with widespread reductions in resting-state CBF. Chronic hypoperfusion may put these people at risk for neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that resting-state CBF is a marker of CMB-related small-vessel disease.","2015",,"JAMA Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the association of incidental CMBs with resting-state CBF , cerebral metabolism , cerebrovascular disease , β-amyloid ( Aβ ) , and cognition ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cerebral Hemorrhage, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cerebrovascular Circulation, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Imaging, Three-Dimensional, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Positron-Emission Tomography, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

How early during the normal life span underlying AD pathologies begin to develop, their patterns of change over time, and their relationship with future cognitive decline remain to be determined.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the within-person trajectories of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD over time and their association with changes in brain amyloid deposition and cognitive decline in cognitively normal middle-aged individuals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: As part of a cohort study, cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] of 0) middle-aged research volunteers (n = 169) enrolled in the Adult Children Study at Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, had undergone serial CSF collection and longitudinal clinical assessment (mean, 6 years; range, 0.91-11.3 years) at 3-year intervals at the time of analysis, between January 2003 and November 2013. A subset (n = 74) had also undergone longitudinal amyloid positron emission tomographic imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in the same period. Serial CSF samples were analyzed for β-amyloid 40 (Aβ40), Aβ42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181), visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40). Within-person measures were plotted according to age and AD risk defined by APOE genotype (ε4 carriers vs noncarriers). Linear mixed models were used to compare estimated biomarker slopes among middle-age bins at baseline (early, 45-54 years; mid, 55-64 years; late, 65-74 years) and between risk groups. Within-person changes in CSF biomarkers were also compared with changes in cortical PiB binding and progression to a CDR higher than 0 at follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau, P-tau181, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 and, in a subset of participants, changes in cortical PiB binding.
RESULTS: While there were no consistent longitudinal patterns in Aβ40 (P = .001-.97), longitudinal reductions in Aβ42 were observed in some individuals as early as early middle age (P ≤ .05) and low Aβ42 levels were associated with the development of cortical PiB-positive amyloid plaques (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.9352; 95% CI, 0.8895-0.9808), especially in mid middle age (P < .001). Markers of neuronal injury (total tau, P-tau181, and VILIP-1) dramatically increased in some individuals in mid and late middle age (P ≤ .02), whereas the neuroinflammation marker YKL-40 increased consistently throughout middle age (P ≤ .003). These patterns were more apparent in at-risk ε4 carriers (Aβ42 in an allele dose-dependent manner) and appeared to be associated with future cognitive deficits as determined by CDR.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Longitudinal CSF biomarker patterns consistent with AD are first detectable during early middle age and are associated with later amyloid positivity and cognitive decline.

However, a major area of controversy is whether delirium is simply a marker of vulnerability to dementia, whether the effect of delirium is solely related to its precipitating factors, or whether delirium itself can cause permanent neuronal damage and lead to dementia. Ultimately, all of these hypotheses are likely to be true. Emerging evidence from epidemiological, clinicopathological, neuroimaging, biomarker, and experimental studies lends support to a strong relation between delirium and dementia, and to both shared and distinct pathological mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate a large family with late-onset AD (LOAD), in which R47H cosegregated with 75% of cases.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study includes genetic and pathologic studies of families with LOAD from 1985 to 2014. A total of 131 families with LOAD (751 individuals) were included from the University of Washington Alzheimer Disease Research Center. To identify LOAD genes/risk factors in the LOAD123 family with 21 affected members and 12 autopsies, we sequenced 4 exomes. Candidate variants were tested for cosegregation with the disease. TREM2 R47H was genotyped in an additional 130 families with LOAD. We performed clinical and neuropathological assessments of patients with and without R47H and evaluated the variant's effect on brain pathology, cellular morphology, and expression of microglial markers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed the effect of TREM2 genotype on age at onset and disease duration. We compared Braak and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease scores, presence of α-synuclein and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 aggregates, and additional vascular or Parkinson pathology in TREM2 R47H carriers vs noncarriers. Microglial activation was assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry and morphometry.
RESULTS: Twelve of 16 patients with AD in the LOAD123 family carried R47H. Eleven patients with dementia had apolipoprotein E 4 (ApoE4) and R47H genotypes. We also found a rare missense variant, D353N, in a nominated AD risk gene, unc-5 homolog C (UNC5C), in 5 affected individuals in the LOAD123 family. R47H carriers demonstrated a shortened disease duration (mean [SD], 6.7 [2.8] vs 11.1 [6.6] years; 2-tailed t test; P = .04) and more frequent α-synucleinopathy. The panmicroglial marker ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 was decreased in all AD cases and the decrease was most pronounced in R47H carriers (mean [SD], in the hilus: 0.114 [0.13] for R47H_AD vs 0.574 [0.26] for control individuals; 2-tailed t test; P = .005 and vs 0.465 [0.32] for AD; P = .02; in frontal cortex gray matter: 0.006 [0.004] for R47H_AD vs 0.016 [0.01] for AD; P = .04 and vs 0.033 [0.013] for control individuals; P < .001). Major histocompatibility complex class II, a marker of microglial activation, was increased in all patients with AD (AD: 2.5, R47H_AD: 2.7, and control: 1.0; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results demonstrate a complex genetic landscape of LOAD, even in a single pedigree with an apparent autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. ApoE4, TREM2 R47H, and rare variants in other genes, such as UNC5C D353N, are likely responsible for the notable occurrence of AD in this family. Our findings support the role of the TREM2 receptor in microglial clearance of aggregation-prone proteins that is compromised in R47H carriers and may accelerate the course of disease.","2015",,"JAMA Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : To investigate a large family with late-onset AD ( LOAD ) , in which R47H cosegregated with 75 % of cases ","other","Age of Onset, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Exome, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Genetic Variation, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Membrane Glycoproteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Receptors, Immunologic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In the first task, participants were required to indicate on a real map the position of the object they had memorized, while in the second task they were invited to retrieve its position from an empty version of the same virtual room, starting from a different position. The entire procedure was repeated across three different trials, depending on the object location in the encoding phase. Our finding showed that aMCI patients performed significantly more poorly in the third trial of the first task, showing a deficit in the ability to encode and store an allocentric viewpoint independent representation. On the other hand, AD patients performed significantly more poorly when compared to the CG in the second task, indicating a specific impairment in storing an allocentric viewpoint independent representation and then syncing it with the allocentric viewpoint dependent representation. Furthermore, data suggested that these impairments are not a product of generalized cognitive decline or of general decay in spatial abilities, but instead may reflect a selective deficit in the spatial organization Overall, these findings provide an initial insight into the cognitive underpinnings of amnestic impairment in aMCI and AD patient exploiting the potentiality of VR.","2015",,"Front Aging Neurosci"," The main objective of this study is to compare the performances of participants suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI group ) , patients with AD ( AD group ) and a control group ( CG ) , using a virtual reality ( VR ) -based procedure for assessing the abilities in","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHOD: Participants included 263 older adults who were cognitively normal at baseline (i.e., had a Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] of 0; Morris, 1993) and returned for an average of 9.5 annual visits. Participants completed standard tests of episodic memory, visuospatial ability, semantic memory, and executive function. Progressors (n = 66) converted to CDR > 0 with a diagnosis of symptomatic AD after a minimum of 3 visits and stable participants (n = 197) never progressed to CDR > 0. Practice effects, defined as the slope of performance across Visits 1-3, were compared between groups and used within subjects to predict risk of conversion. Change-point models that accounted for retest were contrasted with linear models that ignored retest.
RESULTS: The stable group showed practice effects on episodic-memory measures (β = 0.14, SE = .02, p < .0001) but the progressor group did not (β = 0.03, SE = .03, p = .343). Across all participants, practice effects on episodic-memory tests were associated with a decreased risk of progression to AD as indicated by the subdistribution hazards model (SHR; Fine & Gray, 1999); SHR = .110, 95% CI [.032, .384], p = .001). Finally, use of change-point models dramatically altered rate-of-change estimates compared with models that ignored practice.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: This prospective, observational study enrolled 40 children (58% male children, median age of 13 years, and median weight of 47.5 kg) with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Conduction through the AP to a cycle length of ≤250 ms was considered rapid or high-risk; otherwise, patients were nonrapid or low-risk.
RESULTS: The sudden disappearance of the delta-wave was seen in 10 cases (25%) during EST. Accessory pathway was found to be high-risk in 13 cases (13/40, 32.5%) while the accessory path was identified as low-risk in 27 cases; however, six patients (15%) had blocked AP conduction with adenosine during EPS. Low-risk classification by EST alone to identify patients with nonrapid conduction in baseline EPS had a specificity of 93% and a positive predictive value of 90% (accuracy 54%). Blocked AP conduction with adenosine as a marker of nonrapid baseline AP conduction had a specificity of 93% and a positive predictive value of 84%. Finally, AP was adenosine nonresponsive in the majority of patients (28/30, 93%) with persistent delta-waves, 40% of those who had a sudden disappearance of delta-waves had an adenosine-responsive AP (P value: .028).
CONCLUSION: Abrupt loss of preexcitation during EST and blocked AP conduction with adenosine had high specificity and positive predictive value for nonrapid and low-risk antegrade conduction during baseline invasive EPS.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) add to morbidity and increase the risk of becoming dependent on the help of others (e.g., nursing-home referral). In Parkinson's disease (PD), the specific loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and possibly also in the ventral tegmental area induces loss of neurogenic bladder control through dysfunction of a complex network in which selective disinhibition of bladder reflexes is lost. In PD, more than 60% of patients have troublesome bladder symptoms, and 30% experience incontinence, though not daily. In atypical parkinsonism, including multiple system atrophy, LUTS are highly prevalent, and the onset of LUTS in comparison to other autonomic symptoms and motor symptoms may serve as a diagnostic marker. Less is known about the pathophysiology of incontinence in Alzheimer's disease, but higher cognitive function including attention and self-management may play a role. Incontinence is a major risk factor for loss of independence. The complex pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders and hence complex symptoms play important roles in LUTS and patient quality of life. Nocturia, incontinence, and urgency as well as poor bladder emptying are the most common symptoms. These symptoms may interact with the core symptoms of the disorders, increasing the risk of incontinence and infection. In rarer neurogenerative disorder LUTS may be present, most commonly in disorders with spinal cord involvement.

These observations suggest that abnormal glucose metabolism likely plays a role in some aspects of AD pathogenesis, leading us to investigate the link between aberrant glucose metabolism, T2DM, and AD in murine models. Here, we combined two techniques – glucose clamps and in vivo microdialysis – as a means to dynamically modulate blood glucose levels in awake, freely moving mice while measuring real-time changes in amyloid-β (Aβ), glucose, and lactate within the hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF). In a murine model of AD, induction of acute hyperglycemia in young animals increased ISF Aβ production and ISF lactate, which serves as a marker of neuronal activity. These effects were exacerbated in aged AD mice with marked Aβ plaque pathology. Inward rectifying, ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels mediated the response to elevated glucose levels, as pharmacological manipulation of K(ATP) channels in the hippocampus altered both ISF Aβ levels and neuronal activity. Taken together, these results suggest that K(ATP) channel activation mediates the response of hippocampal neurons to hyperglycemia by coupling metabolism with neuronal activity and ISF Aβ levels.","2015",,"J Clin Invest"," These observations suggest that abnormal glucose metabolism likely plays a role in some aspects of AD pathogenesis , leading us to investigate the link between aberrant glucose metabolism , T2DM , and AD in murine models ","other","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Animals, FALSE, Diabetes Complications, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, FALSE, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Hippocampus, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Hyperglycemia, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, KATP Channels, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Transgenic, FALSE, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

While it is a primarily physical measure, experimental studies have shown that merely priming older adults with negative stereotypes about aging results in immediate declines in objective walking speed. What is not clear is whether this is a temporary experimental effect or whether negative aging stereotypes have detrimental effects on long term objective health. We sought to explore the association between baseline negative perceptions of aging in the general population and objective walking speed 2 years later.
METHOD: 4,803 participations were assessed over 2 waves of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a prospective, population representative study of adults aged 50+ in the Republic of Ireland. Wave 1 measures - which included the Aging Perceptions Questionnaire, walking speed and all covariates - were taken between 2009 and 2011. Wave 2 measures - which included a second measurement of walking speed and covariates - were collected 2 years later between March and December 2012. Walking speed was measured as the number of seconds to complete the Timed Up-And-Go (TUG) task. Participations with a history of stroke, Parkinson's disease or an MMSE < 18 were excluded.
RESULTS: After full adjustment for all covariates (age, gender, level of education, disability, chronic conditions, medications, global cognition and baseline TUG) negative perceptions of aging at baseline were associated with slower TUG speed 2 years later (B=.03, 95% CI = .01 to 05, p< .05).

However, how NT-proBNP relates to incident dementia and cognitive-decline in community-dwelling persons is unknown.
METHODS: Between 1997 and 2001, serum NT-proBNP was measured in 6040 participants (mean age 69 years, 57% women) free of heart-failure and dementia from the Rotterdam Study. Participants were continuously followed-up for incident dementia until 2012, for 56,616 person-years. Cognition was assessed at baseline and reassessed between 2002 and 2006 by Letter-Digit-Substitution-task, Stroop test and Word-Fluency test. Associations of NT-proBNP with dementia (555 cases), Alzheimer's disease (357 cases) and vascular dementia (32 cases) were assessed linearly, and in quartiles using Cox regression. Associations of NT-proBNP with cognitive-decline were assessed using multiple linear regression. All analyses were repeated after excluding patients with CVD.
RESULTS: Higher NT-proBNP was associated with a higher risk of dementia, even after excluding patients with CVD and adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, HR per SD 1.27 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.44). Associations were particularly strong for vascular dementia, HR per SD 2.04 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.55), but also for Alzheimer's disease when comparing the second and third quartile with first. Higher NT-proBNP was cross-sectionally associated with poorer performance in multiple cognitive tests but longitudinally only in Letter-Digit-Substitution-task.

METHODS: Two case-control cohorts from Tel-Aviv and New-York, including 1133 PD patients and 867 controls were genotyped for four RLS-related SNPs in the genes MEIS1, BTBD9, PTPRD and MAP2K5/SKOR1. The association between genotype, PD risk and phenotype was tested using multivariate regression models.
RESULTS: None of the tested SNPs was significantly associated with PD risk, neither in any individual cohort nor in the combined analysis after correction for multiple comparisons. The MAP2K5/SKOR1 marker rs12593813 was associated with higher frequency of tremor in the Tel-Aviv cohort (61.0% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.001, dominant model). However, the risk allele for tremor in this gene has been associated with reduced RLS risk. Moreover, this association did not replicate in Tremor-dominant PD patients from New-York.

However, there is little or no evidence for a direct association between dietary nutrients and brain biomarkers of AD. This study identifies nutrient patterns associated with major brain AD biomarkers in a cohort of clinically and cognitively normal (NL) individuals at risk for AD.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Manhattan (broader area).
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two NL individuals (age 54+12 y, 70% women, Clinical Dementia Rating=0, MMSE>27, neuropsychological test performance within norms by age and education) with complete dietary information and cross-sectional, 3D T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; gray matter volumes, GMV, a marker of brain atrophy), 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB; a marker of fibrillar amyloid-β, Aβ) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; a marker of glucose metabolism, METglc) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were examined.
MEASUREMENTS: Dietary intake of 35 nutrients associated with cognitive function and AD was assessed using the Harvard/Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire. Principal component analysis was used to generate nutrient patterns (NP) from the full nutrient panel. Statistical parametric mapping and voxel based morphometry were used to assess the associations of the identified NPs with AD biomarkers.
RESULTS: None of the participants were diabetics, smokers, or met criteria for obesity. Five NPs were identified: NP1 was characterized by most B-vitamins and several minerals [VitB and Minerals]; NP2 by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, including ω-3 and ω-6 PUFA, and vitamin E [VitE and PUFA]; NP3 by vitamin A, vitamin C, carotenoids and dietary fibers [Anti-oxidants and Fibers]; NP4 by vitamin B12, vitamin D and zinc [VitB12 and D]; NP5 by saturated, trans-saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium [Fats]. Voxel-based analysis showed that NP4 scores [VitB12 and D] were positively associated with METglc and GMV, and negatively associated with PiB retention in AD-vulnerable regions (p<0.001). In addition, both METglc and GMV were positively associated with NP2 scores [VitE and PUFA], and negatively associated with NP5 scores [Fats] (p<0.001), and METglc was positively associated with higher NP3 scores [Anti-oxidants and Fibers] (p<0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education, caloric intake, BMI, alcohol consumption, family history and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status did not attenuate these relationships. The identified 'AD-protective' nutrient combination was associated with higher intake of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairies, and lower intake of sweets, fried potatoes, high-fat dairies, processed meat and butter.

There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP.

METHODS: We included 12,162 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, a community-based cohort, without a diagnosis of PD at baseline (1987-1989) and with available HRV data (mean age = 54 years, 57% women). A 2-minute electrocardiogram was used to measure HRV. Incident PD was identified through 2008 from multiple sources, and adjudicated. Multivariable Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PD by quartiles of HRV measurements.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 18 years, we identified 78 incident PD cases. Lower values of the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal R-R intervals (rMSSD) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN), markers of parasympathetic activity and total variability, respectively, were associated with higher PD risk during follow-up. In multivariate models, the HR (95% CI) of PD in the bottom quartiles of rMSSD and SDNN compared to the top quartiles were 2.1 (1.0-4.3) and 2.9 (1.4-6.1), respectively. Other measures of cardiac autonomic function, including mean R-R interval and frequency-domain measurements, were not associated with PD risk.

The neural mechanism underlying freezing in PD is poorly understood. Here, we report a 2-year follow-up on the novel discovery of prolonged step initiation duration as a potential marker of impending freezing.
METHODS: Non-freezing PD participants in stages 2.5-4 of the Hoehn and Yahr disease severity scale were recruited from an earlier study which determined the effect of semi-virtual cues on walking. Responders were those who completed the first step faster in the presence of the virtual cues while non-responders either did not change or took longer to complete the first step. Both groups of participants were interviewed 2 years later to determine who had developed freezing of gait.
RESULTS: Participants in the responder group had a 13-fold risk of developing freezing of gait within 2 years following the cueing study (OR=13.3, 95% CI=1.1-167). A cutoff score of -2.6% (i.e., a decrease in the duration of the first step with visual cues by 2.6% relative to no cues) gave a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 89%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first novel discovery of a physical predictor of freezing in PD.

RESULTS: We report that animals deficient in the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, have high baseline levels of central nervous system protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant defenses, and decreased energetic status. Stress-associated molecules typically linked to Parkinson's disease such as the mitochondrial kinase, PTEN-inducible putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and another E3 ligase, Parkin, are upregulated in brains from CHIP knockout (KO) animals. Utilizing a novel biotin-avidin capture technique, we found that the oxidation status of Parkin and the mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), are altered in a CHIP-dependent manner. We also found that following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), the expression of CHIP, PINK1, and the autophagic marker, LC3, increase and there is activation of the redox-sensitive kinase p66(shc). Under conditions of OGD, CHIP relocalizes from the cytosol to mitochondria. Mitochondria from CHIP KO mice have profound impairments in stress response induced by calcium overload, resulting in accelerated permeability transition activity. While CHIP-deficient neurons are morphologically intact, they are more susceptible to OGD consistent with a previously unknown neuroprotective role for CHIP in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.

RECENT FINDINGS: The studies reviewed here confirm previous reports on the poor olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease compared to health normal controls and also as a marker for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. Olfactory identification function has been associated with severity of illness, non-cognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and structural and functional MRI measures. There is a possible interaction of apolipoprotein E genotype with olfactory performance in Alzheimer's disease patients and those at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Usefulness of smell identification function in differentiating Alzheimer's disease patients from other types of dementia needs to be established.
SUMMARY: The need for simple, inexpensive and non-invasive procedures for aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of Alzheimer's disease has led to theories and procedures examining the role of olfactory functions in Alzheimer's disease. Although there is increasing evidence for olfactory dysfunction in general and impaired odour identification in particular in Alzheimer's disease, additional larger and methodologically sound research is needed for testing its clinical utility in day-to-day clinical practice for early, accurate and differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.","2015",,"Curr Opin Psychiatry"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : To provide an update of the recent studies on the olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease , with a focus on the olfactory identification function "," review","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Humans, FALSE, Olfaction Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Olfactory Pathways, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: In 294 patients with HF (mean age 82.0±7.9 years, 72.1% women) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, bilirubin, 25(OH)vitaminD, PTH, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, thyroid function and cardiac troponin I were measured.
RESULTS: Elevated ALT, GGT, ALP or bilirubin levels on admission were observed in 1.7%-9.9% of patients. With age GGT, ALT and leptin decrease, while PTH and adiponectin concentrations increase. Higher GGT (>30 U/L, median level) was associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcohol overuse; lower ALT (≤20 U/L, median level) with dementia; total bilirubin>20 μmol/L with CAD and alcohol overuse; and albumin>33 g/L with CAD. Multivariate adjusted regression analyses revealed ALT, ALP, adiponectin, alcohol overuse and DM as independent and significant determinants of GGT (as continuous or categorical variable); GGT for each other liver marker; and PTH for adiponectin. The risk of prolonged hospital stay (>20 days) was about two times higher in patients with GGT>30 U/L or adiponectin>17.14 ng/L (median level) and 4.7 times higher if both conditions coexisted. The risk of in-hospital death was 3 times higher if albumin was <33 g/L.
CONCLUSIONS: In older HF patients liver markers even within the normal range are associated with age-related disorders and outcomes. Adiponectin (but not 25(OH)vitaminD, PTH, leptin or resistin) is an independent contributor to higher GGT. Serum GGT and albumin predict prolonged hospital stay and in-hospital death, respectively.

However, little is known regarding the prevalence and related factors of CKD among Chinese LLI over 95 years of age.
METHODS: We used data of LLI from the Rugao longevity cohort, a population-based association study conducted in Rugao, a longevity town of China. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Demographic exposures and biochemical markers were correlated with CKD.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CKD among LLI in Rugao is 23.8%. Traditional risk factors for CKD among general population, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, did not have associations with CKD. However, overweight, central adiposity, and hyperuricemia were associated with increased risk of CKD, with crude odds ratios of 2.41 (95% CI=1.23-4.69), 2.61 (95% CI=1.42-4.77), and 5.69 (95% CI=2.75-11.76), respectively. In addition, higher magnesium and filtration marker β2 microglobulin (β2M) were associated with CKD, with crude odds ratios of 2.47 (95% CI=1.38-4.43) and 16.38 (95% CI=6.76-39.64), respectively.

The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality (VR)-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD-NC; 15 PD-MCI, and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the EFs, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of EFs.
RESULTS: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients vs. the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of EFs (neuropsychological battery).

The method is harmless, is quick to perform at low cost and demands no sedation. The main limitations of this technique are dependence on the quality of the individual bone window and on proper operator training. A huge body of research has shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) display an enlarged hyperechogenic substantia nigra by TCS with a positive predictive value of 92.9%. Healthy individuals (8-15%) may show the same marker, in some cases correlating with decreased striatal dopamine uptake, motor slowing and prodromal markers of PD, indicating that this ultrasound sign may constitute a risk marker for PD.

Some genetic risk factors convey risk for AF and cerebral ischemic events. These markers may identify AF patients at risk for dementia either directly or through a gene-gene interaction with the ApoE ε4 variant, a known marker of dementia risk.
METHODS: Caucasian patients with AF and a subsequent dementia diagnosis (n = 112) were matched 1:2 on sex, AF onset age, and follow-up period to AF patients without dementia. AF patients with dementia and AF patients without dementia were matched 1:1 on sex and age at dementia diagnosis (n = 112). Genotyping employed Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations between AF/dementia groups and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), as well as gene-gene interactions.
RESULTS: In dementia patients, there was an association between the PITX2 loci and AF (rs2634073: odds ratio [OR] = 2.11; P = 0.025 and rs2200733: OR = 2.27; P = 0.029). In patients with AF, there was an association between PITX2 loci, rs2200733, and dementia (OR = 2.15, P = 0.008). There was no association between ApoE ε4 allele and AF in patients with dementia, although confirmation of the association between the carriage of ApoE ε4 allele and dementia was found (OR = 1.79; P = 0.026) in patients with AF. There were no significant interactions between ApoE ε4 allele and both the PITX2 loci and ZFHX3.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support prior studies of ApoE risk of noncerebral vascular accident-related dementia/Alzheimer's risk in the Caucasians and provide support to suggest an association between PITX2-related SNPs and dementia, which may in part be attributed to silent cerebral ischemic events, a hypothesis deserving further testing.","2015",,"Pacing Clin Electrophysiol",,"other","Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Atrial Fibrillation, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Causality, FALSE, Comorbidity, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Genetic Markers, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Genetic Variation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Homeodomain Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Transcription Factors, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Utah, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Homeobox Protein PITX2, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

These particular signalling molecules are involved in PD pathophysiology, but are also very important in an aberrant coagulation/hematology system. We present and discuss a hypothesis regarding the possible interaction of these aberrant signalling molecules implicated in PD, and suggest that these molecules may affect the erythrocytes of PD patients.

Basic science and clinical research suggest that this hormone not only affects the regulation of the neuroendocrine axes, but also exerts effects on the central nervous system with subsequent alterations in psychological functions. For instance, leptin suppresses cortisol secretion during stress-related activation of the adrenal axis. As psychiatric disorders like depression are associated with hypercortisolism, leptin is proposed to exert anti-depressant-like effects due to its inhibition of chronically overactive hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Moreover, leptin status of depressed patients could serve as a prognostic marker for therapy response. Besides its influence on neuroendocrine pathways leptin seems to have direct central effects on brain development and neuroplasticity.

This study investigated the association between OIDs and symptoms of parkinsonism as a derivative of dopaminergic functioning.
METHODS: In 320 patients diagnosed with non-affective psychosis, olfactory identification performance was assessed by means of the Sniffin' Sticks task. Level of parkinsonian symptoms was assessed by means of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). By means of multiple linear regression with bootstrapping, the association between UPDRS and Sniffin' Sticks score was investigated while correcting for potential confounders.

Here, we explore the role of plasma apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) as a risk marker for PD and evaluate the influence of APOA1 promoter variation on plasma ApoA1 levels. Plasma ApoA1 and the single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs670, were assayed in a discovery cohort (cohort 1) of 301 PD patients, 80 normal controls (NCs), and 165 subjects with other neurodegenerative diseases, as well as a cohort (cohort 2) of 158 PD patients from a second clinical site. Additionally, rs670 was genotyped in a third cohort of 1,494 PD and 925 NC subjects from both clinical sites. Compared to both normal and disease controls, PD patients have lower plasma ApoA1 (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Moreover, in PD patients, plasma ApoA1 levels are correlated with genotype at the APOA1 promoter polymorphism, rs670. Specifically, lower plasma ApoA1 levels were found in rs670 major allele (G) homozygotes in both cohort 1 (P = 0.009) and in a replication cohort (cohort 2; n = 158 PD patients; P = 0.024). Finally, evaluating rs670 genotype frequencies in 1,930 PD cases versus 997 NCs, the rs670 GG genotype shows a trend toward association (odds ratio: 1.1; P = 0.10) with PD. Our results are compatible with a model whereby circulating ApoA1 levels may be useful in risk-stratifying subjects for the development of PD, with higher ApoA1 levels suggesting relative protection.

However, depression alone is unlikely to be a useful marker of prodromal PD due to its low specificity. In this longitudinal observational study, we assessed whether the presence of other potential markers of prodromal PD predicts the subsequent development of PD in MDD patients. Of 57 patients with severe MDD but no diagnosis of PD who underwent a structured interview, olfactory and motor investigation and transcranial sonography at baseline, 46 (36 women; mean age 54.9 ± 11.7 years) could be followed for up to 11 (median, 10) years. Three patients (2 women; age 64, 65 and 70 years) developed definite PD after 1, 7, and 9 years, respectively. The combined finding of mild asymmetric motor slowing, idiopathic hyposmia, and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity predicted subsequent PD in all patients who could be followed for longer than 1 year. Out of the whole study cohort, only the subjects with subsequent PD presented with the triad of asymmetric motor slowing, idiopathic hyposmia, and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity in combination with at least two out of four reportable risk factors (family history of PD, current non-smoker, non-coffee drinker, constipation) at baseline investigation. Post-hoc analysis revealed that additional rating of eye and eye-lid motor abnormalities might further improve the prediction of PD in larger cohorts.

METHODS: For this case-control study, we identified 1,808 patients with PD diagnosed between 1996 and 2009 from Danish registries, matched 1,876 population controls on sex and year of birth, and collected lifestyle information. We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals with logistic regression adjusting for matching factors and confounders.
RESULTS: Fewer patients with PD than controls ever established a smoking habit. Among former smokers, those with greater difficulty quitting or using nicotine substitutes were less likely to develop PD, with the risk being lowest among those reporting ""extremely difficult to quit"" compared with ""easy to quit."" Nicotine substitute usage was strongly associated with quitting difficulty and duration of smoking, i.e., most strongly among current smokers, followed by former smokers who had used nicotine substitutes, and less strongly among former smokers who never used substitutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the notion that patients with PD are able to quit smoking more easily than controls. These findings are compatible with a decreased responsiveness to nicotine during the prodromal phase of PD. We propose that ease of smoking cessation is an aspect of premanifest PD similar to olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep disorders, or constipation and suggests that the apparent ""neuroprotective"" effect of smoking observed in epidemiologic studies is due to reverse causation.","2014",,"Neurology"," OBJECTIVE : To assess whether being able to quit smoking is an early marker of Parkinson disease ( PD ) onset rather than tobacco being "" neuroprotective , "" we analyzed information about ease of quitting and nicotine substitute use ","other","Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Denmark, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Odds Ratio, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Registries, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Smoking Cessation, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Tobacco Use Cessation Devices, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: The Quebec health insurance program database (RAMQ).
PARTICIPANTS: 1796 people with a first diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and followed up for at least six years before were matched with 7184 controls on sex, age group, and duration of follow-up. Both groups were randomly sampled from older people (age >66) living in the community in 2000-09.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The association between Alzheimer's disease and benzodiazepine use started at least five years before diagnosis was assessed by using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Ever exposure to benzodiazepines was first considered and then categorised according to the cumulative dose expressed as prescribed daily doses (1-90, 91-180, >180) and the drug elimination half life.
RESULTS: Benzodiazepine ever use was associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (adjusted odds ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.69; further adjustment on anxiety, depression, and insomnia did not markedly alter this result: 1.43, 1.28 to 1.60). No association was found for a cumulative dose <91 prescribed daily doses. The strength of association increased with exposure density (1.32 (1.01 to 1.74) for 91-180 prescribed daily doses and 1.84 (1.62 to 2.08) for >180 prescribed daily doses) and with the drug half life (1.43 (1.27 to 1.61) for short acting drugs and 1.70 (1.46 to 1.98) for long acting ones).
CONCLUSION: Benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The stronger association observed for long term exposures reinforces the suspicion of a possible direct association, even if benzodiazepine use might also be an early marker of a condition associated with an increased risk of dementia. Unwarranted long term use of these drugs should be considered as a public health concern.","2014",,"BMJ"," OBJECTIVES : To investigate the relation between the risk of Alzheimer's disease and exposure to benzodiazepines started at least five years before , considering both the dose-response relation and prodromes ( anxiety , depression , insomnia ) possibly linked with treatment ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Anxiety Disorders, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Benzodiazepines, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Depressive Disorder, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Quebec, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Little work has been done to determine if PDGF is associated with outcomes after stroke, in particular cognitive outcomes. Therefore, in this sudy, we investigated the association between PDGFand both vascular and cognitive outcomes in a cohort of patients with recent nondisabling ischemic stroke.
METHODS: Three hundred nine patients recruited within six-months of a transient ischemic attack or nondisabling ischemic stroke [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 3] were followed for up to five-years. Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of PDGF levels with the risk of death, recurrent vascular events, dependency, and incident dementia, while logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of PDGF levels with the risk of significant cognitive decline. Significant cognitive decline was defined as : (a) a decline of cognitive status from no cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment with no dementia to moderate cognitive impairment with no dementia or (b) conversion to dementia.
RESULTS: Patients (mean age 60 years) were mostly male (64%) and of Chinese ethnicity (85%) and had posterior circulation or lacunar infarcts (73%). In univariate analysis, PDGF was significantly associated with a lower risk of recurrent vascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 0·61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·44-0·84]. In multivariate analysis adjusting for treatment, PDGF was independently associated with a lower risk of recurrent vascular events (HR 0·62; 95% CI 0·46-0·85). PDGF levels were not associated with the risk of the other outcomes of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of PDGF-AB/BB were independently associated with a lower risk of recurrent vascular events in a cohort of convalescent nondisabled stroke patients.

Identification of predictive markers for neuron-prone AFSCs is necessary before such stem cell-based therapeutics can become a reality. In an attempt to identify markers of AFSCs to predict their ability for neurogenesis, we performed a two-phase study. In the discovery phase of 23 AFSCs, we tested ZNF521/Zfp521, OCT6, SOX1, SOX2, SOX3, and SOX9 as predictive markers of AFSCs for neural differentiation. In the validation phase, the efficacy of these predictive markers was tested in independent sets of 18 AFSCs and 14 dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). We found that high expression of SOX9 in AFSCs is associated with good neurogenetic ability, and these positive correlations were confirmed in independent sets of AFSCs and DPSCs. Furthermore, knockdown of SOX9 in AFSCs inhibited their neuronal differentiation.

OBJECTIVE: In this study we used Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine if gray matter loss and/or an increase of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reflecting mean diffusivity (MD) are an early marker of conversion from MCI to AD in a high risk population.
METHOD: Retrospective neuropsychological and clinical data were collected for fifty-five subjects (MCI converters n = 13, MCI non-converters n = 14, healthy controls n = 28) at baseline and one follow-up visit. All participants underwent diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline to analyse changes in GM density and WM integrity using VBM.
RESULTS: At baseline MCI converters showed impaired performance in verbal memory and naming compared to MCI non-converters. Further, MCI converters showed decreased WM integrity in the frontal, parietal, occipital, as well as the temporal lobe prior to conversion to AD. Multiple regression analysis showed a positive correlation of gray matter atrophy with specific neuropsychological test results.

In addition to grey matter pathology, white matter changes are now recognized as an important pathological feature in the emergence of the disease. Despite growing recognition of the importance of white matter abnormalities in the pathogenesis of AD, the causes of white matter degeneration are still unknown. While multiple studies propose Wallerian-like degeneration as the source of white matter change, others suggest that primary white matter pathology may be due, at least in part, to other mechanisms, including local effects of toxic Aβ peptides. In the current study, we investigated levels of soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ) in white matter of AD patients (n=12) compared with controls (n=10). Fresh frozen white matter samples were obtained from anterior (Brodmann area 9) and posterior (Brodmann area 1, 2 and 3) areas of post-mortem AD and control brains. ELISA was used to examine levels of soluble Aβ -42 and Aβ -40. Total cortical neuritic plaque severity rating was derived from individual ratings in the following areas of cortex: mid-frontal, superior temporal, pre-central, inferior parietal, hippocampus (CA1), subiculum, entorhinal cortex, transentorhinal cortex, inferior temporal, amygdala and basal forebrain. Compared with controls, AD samples had higher white matter levels of both soluble Aβ -42 and Aβ -40. While no regional white matter differences were found in Aβ -40, Aβ -42 levels were higher in anterior regions than in posterior regions across both groups. After statistically controlling for total cortical neuritic plaque severity, differences in both soluble Aβ -42 and Aβ -40 between the groups remained, suggesting that white matter Aβ peptides accumulate independent of overall grey matter fibrillar amyloid pathology and are not simply a reflection of overall amyloid burden. These results shed light on one potential mechanism through which white matter degeneration may occur in AD. Given that white matter degeneration may be an early marker of disease, preceding grey matter atrophy, understanding the mechanisms and risk factors that may lead to white matter loss could help to identify those at high risk and to intervene earlier in the pathogenic process.","2014",,"Acta Neuropathol Commun"," In the current study , we investigated levels of soluble amyloid-beta ( Aβ ) in white matter of AD patients ( n = 12 ) compared with controls ( n = 10 ) ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Plaque, Amyloid, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, White Matter, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Psychomotor retardation could constitute a marker of this negative burden of past depressive episodes, with conflicting findings according to the use of clinical versus cognitive assessments. We assessed the role of the Retardation Depressive Scale (filled in by the clinician) and the time required to perform the neurocognitive d2 attention test and the Trail Making Test (performed by patients) in a sample of 2048 depressed outpatients, before and after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment with agomelatine. From this sample, 1140 patients performed the TMT-A and -B, and 508 performed the d2 test, at baseline and after treatment. At baseline, we found that with more past depressive episodes patients had more severe clinical level of psychomotor retardation, and that they needed more time to perform both d2 and TMT.

Also, both cognitive decline and stroke increase mortality risk.
METHODS: A longitudinal population-based cohort of 7217 older adults without a history of stroke from a biracial community was interviewed at 3-year intervals. Cognitive function was assessed using a standardized global cognitive score. Stroke was determined by linkage with Medicare claims, and mortality was ascertained via the National Death Index. We used a Cox model to assess the risk of incident stroke, a joint model with a piecewise linear mixed model with incident stroke as a change point for cognitive decline process, and a time-dependent relative risk regression model for mortality risk.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 1187 (16%) subjects had incident stroke. After adjusting for known confounders, lower baseline cognitive function was associated with a higher risk of incident stroke (hazard ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-1.77). Cognitive function declined by 0.064 U per year before incident stroke occurrence and 0.122 U per year after stroke, a nearly 1.9-fold increase in cognitive decline (95% confidence interval, 1.78-2.03). Both stroke (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.26) and cognitive decline (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.81-1.98) increased mortality risk.

METHOD: A case control study was performed comparing the characteristics of 30-day general medicine patients readmitted between 1 January to 30 June 2012 to a general medicine service at Capital and Coast District Health Board (Wellington region, New Zealand) with an equal number of randomly selected patients not readmitted to the service during the same time period.
RESULTS: 197 patients discharged from general medicine were readmitted during the 6-month study period. There were no differences in the sex, ethnicity, residential care at admission, history of dementia, length of admission or weekend discharge of readmitted patients compared to non-readmitted patients. The mean age, number of medications and comorbidities score were higher in the readmission group. Readmission (even after controlling for age, polypharmacy, and comorbidities) was a strong predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality, with an odds ratio of 2.2. Twenty-one percent of readmission patients had more than one general medicine readmission, up to 30 days between each, with even higher mortality rate compared to one readmission (49% vs. 28%).
CONCLUSION: Readmission to general medicine is strongly associated with older age, polypharmacy, and multiple comorbidities. Readmission is an independent strong risk factor for 1-year mortality, with this risk increasing after multiple readmissions.

With the knowledge that the association between MAPT structure and disease may be distinct in different ethnics, we intend to investigate the haplotype structure of MAPT in Taiwanese and test it for association with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: One hundred and eight AD patients and 108 sex- and-age matched healthy controls were recruited from the dementia outpatient clinic of Chang Gung Medical center. We genotyped the del-In9 marker that defines the extended H1 and H2 clades. We selected 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the extended MAPT region from Japanese SNPs database and dbSNP database. Using the software TagIt, we analyzed the linkage disequilibrium structure of MAPT and compared the allele and genotype distribution between patient group and control group.
RESULTS: All the Taiwanese participants were H1 haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed the haplotype blocks in Taiwanese population had a smaller size in comparison to that of the Caucasian population. Single locus association showed significant p value in one of the tagging variants (rs242557) in our Taiwanese AD case-control cohorts.
CONCLUSION: MAPT gene has four haplotype blocks in the Taiwanese population, each of around 40 kbp. In both European study and our study, the SNP rs242557 showed association with AD.

Certain factors-for example, living alone-may increase the risk for hospitalization, and their effect may be greater among persons with dementia and the old-old (aged 85+).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of living alone and risk for hospitalization, and see if the observed effect is greater among persons with dementia or the old-old.
DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: 2,636 participants in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a longitudinal cohort study of dementia incidence. Participants were adults aged 65+ enrolled in an integrated health care system who completed biennial follow-up visits to assess for dementia and living situation.
MAIN MEASURES: Hospitalization for all causes and for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) were identified using automated data.
KEY RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age of participants was 75.5 years, 59 % were female and 36 % lived alone. Follow-up time averaged 8.4 years (SD 3.5), yielding 10,431 approximately 2-year periods for analysis. Living alone was positively associated with being aged 85+, female, and having lower reported social support and better physical function, and negatively associated with having dementia. In a regression model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity burden, physical function and length of follow-up, living alone was not associated with all-cause (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.84, 1.03) or ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) hospitalization (OR = 0.88; 95 % CI 0.73, 1.07). Among participants aged 85+, living alone was associated with a lower risk for all-cause (OR = 0.76; 95 % CI 0.61, 0.94), but not ACSC hospitalization.

Delirium is a condition of acute brain dysfunction for which a pre-existing diagnosis of dementia is a risk factor. Conversely delirium is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. The reasons for this bidirectional relationship are not well understood. Our aim was to review possible similarities in the clinical presentation and pathophysiology between delirium and DLB, and explore possible links between these diagnoses. A systematic search using Medline, Embase and Psychinfo was performed. References were scanned for relevant articles, supplemented by articles identified from reference lists and those known to the authors. 94 articles were selected for inclusion in the review. Delirium and DLB share a number of clinical similarities, including global impairment of cognition, fluctuations in attention and perceptual abnormalities. Delirium is a frequent presenting feature of DLB. In terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, cholinergic dysfunction and genetics may provide a common link. Neuroimaging studies suggest a brain vulnerability in delirium which may also occur in dementia. The basal ganglia, which play a key role in DLB, have also been implicated in delirium. The role of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biomarkers for both diagnoses is an interesting area although some results are conflicting and further work in this area is needed. Delirium and DLB share a number of features and we hypothesise that delirium may, in some cases, represent early or 'prodromal' DLB. Further research is needed to test the novel hypothesis that delirium may be an early marker for future DLB, which would aid early diagnosis of DLB and identify those at high risk.","2015",,"J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry"," Our aim was to review possible similarities in the clinical presentation and pathophysiology between delirium and DLB , and explore possible links between these diagnoses "," review","Accidental Falls, FALSE, Affective Symptoms, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Consciousness Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Delirium, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Delusions, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Functional Neuroimaging, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lewy Body Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Movement Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Perceptual Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Sleep Wake Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Syncope, FALSE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the neurobiological correlates of CT using Mismatch Negativity (MMN), a neurophysiological marker of pre-attentive information processing, which in turn, is postulated to underpin higher-order cognitive processes.
METHODS: As part of a larger randomized controlled trial, forty 'at risk' (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or late-life depression) participants aged 51-79 years underwent neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and psychiatric assessments before and after a multi-faceted seven-week CT program or a 'treatment-as-usual' seven-week waitlist period.
RESULTS: The treatment group demonstrated significantly increased fronto-central MMN responses (p < 0.05), as well as improved phonemic verbal fluency (p < 0.05) and decreased self-rated memory difficulties (p < 0.05) following CT, in comparison to the waitlist control group. However, there were no significant correlations between enhanced MMN and cognitive/psychosocial outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this preliminary investigation indicate that CT is associated with enhanced neurophysiological mechanisms suggestive of improved pre-attentive processing, which may reflect alterations in underlying neurobiology.

Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), blocks the oxidation of xanthine to urate. The present study sought to determine whether lowering levels of urate using allopurinol results in exacerbated neurotoxicity in a dual pesticide mouse model of PD. Although oral allopurinol reduced serum and striatal urate levels 4-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, it did not alter the multiple motor deficits induced by chronic (7 week) intermittent (biweekly) exposure to intraperitoneal Paraquat (PQ) plus Maneb (MB). However, striatal dopamine content, which was unaffected after either allopurinol or chronic pesticide exposure alone, was significantly reduced by 22% in mice exposed to the combination. Stereological assessment showed that the numbers of dopaminergic nigral neurons were significantly reduced by 29% and the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) negative neurons unaffected after PQ+MB treatments. This reduction in TH-positive neurons was not affected by allopurinol treatment. Of note, despite the expectation of exacerbated oxidative damage due to the reduction in urate, protein carbonyl levels, a marker of oxidative damage, were actually reduced in the presence of allopurinol. Overall, allopurinol lowered urate levels but did not exacerbate dopaminergic neuron degeneration, findings suggesting that basal levels of urate in mice do not appreciably protect against oxidative damage and neurotoxicity in the PQ+MB model of PD, and/or that allopurinol produces an antioxidant benefit offsetting its detrimental urate-lowering effect.","2014",,"Brain Res",,"other","Allopurinol, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Animals, FALSE, Corpus Striatum, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Dopamine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Dopaminergic Neurons, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Enzyme Inhibitors, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Male, FALSE, Maneb, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Motor Activity, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Paraquat, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Pesticides, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Uric Acid, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.
SETTING: Community-based, outpatient.
PATIENTS: Men and women aged 65 years or older without dementia at baseline.
INTERVENTION(S): All subjects completed the Modified Mini-Mental Status Exam (3MS-R) at baseline and over 3 triennial follow-up visits. Hearing loss (HL) at baseline was based on observation of hearing difficulties during testing or interview. Incident dementia was determined by clinical assessment and expert consensus.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Dementia and 3MS-R score.
RESULTS: At baseline, 4,463 subjects were without dementia, 836 of whom had HL. Of those with HL, 16.3% developed dementia, compared with 12.1% of those without HL (p < 0.001). Mean time to dementia was 10.3 years in the HL group versus 11.9 years for non-HL (log rank test p < 0.001). In Cox regression analyses controlling for sex, presence of APOE- [Latin Small Letter Open E]4 allele, education, and baseline age, and cardiovascular risk factors, HL was an independent predictor of developing dementia (hazard ratio = 1.27, p = 0.026 [95% CI, 1.03-1.56]). Linear mixed models controlling for similar covariates showed HL was associated with faster decline on the 3MS-R, at a rate of 0.26 points/year worse than those without HL.
CONCLUSION: Elderly individuals with HL have an increased rate of developing dementia and more rapid decline on 3MS-R scores than their nonhearing impaired counterparts.

One factor that may contribute to the increased risk for these conditions is the development of chronic inflammation. The current study evaluated whether diet-induced obesity (DIO) affects cognitive performance by increasing neuroinflammation and prolonging the behavioral and inflammatory response to an immune challenge. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat (60% fat) or control diet (10% fat) for 2 or 5 months. After consuming their respective diets for two months, sickness associated behaviors were assessed 4 and 24h after a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline injection. In a separate experiment, DIO and control mice were tested for spatial learning in the water maze and challenged with LPS one month later. Peripheral cytokine production was assessed in adipose and spleen samples and the neuroinflammatory response was assessed in hippocampal, cortical, and brain samples. DIO impaired acquisition of a spatial learning task relative to control mice. However, these deficits are unlikely to be related to inflammation as DIO showed no changes in basal cytokine levels within the periphery or brain. Further, in response to LPS DIO mice showed comparable or attenuated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 relative to control mice. DIO also reduced hippocampal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin. Presently, the data indicate that DIO suppresses aspects of the immune response and that cognitive deficits associated with DIO may be related to reduced neurotrophic support rather than inflammation.","2014",,"Behav Brain Res",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Body Weight, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Cytokines, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Diet, High-Fat, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Hippocampus, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Interleukin-1beta, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Interleukin-6, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Lipopolysaccharides, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Male, FALSE, Maze Learning, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Motor Activity, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Obesity, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Spatial Learning, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Spleen, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Synaptophysin, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Task Performance and Analysis, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 68 elderly healthy people (24 men; 44 women) followed by completion of the BDI, MMSE, and FAB from 2004 to 2006. The same cohort underwent BDI again from 2007 to 2009.
RESULTS: In healthy elderly women subject, a significant positive correlation was found between salivary cortisol levels at baseline and BDI scores at follow-up, but not at baseline. Salivary cortisol levels at baseline were not correlated with the score of either MMSE or FAB. When the cut-off point of BDI scores were set at 20/21, logistic regression analyses revealed that salivary cortisol levels at baseline had a significant positive relationship with a later depressive state.

They are supposed to already represent the prodromal neurodegenerative state in those who later develop PD and are thus called prodromal markers. In this study, three prodromal markers, depression, rapid eye movement behaviour disorder (RBD) and hyposmia, were selected and were related to other prodromal features in elderly individuals without PD.
METHODS: From the Tübinger Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration (TREND) study, 698 healthy individuals aged 50-80 years reporting one or more of the selected prodromal markers (SPMs), but without neurodegenerative disorders, were evaluated and classified according to the status of prodromal markers. Other prodromal PD-related features were assessed with a 23-item questionnaire and compared between participants with and without the three SPMs.
RESULTS: Individuals with the SPMs for PD endorsed more of the additional possible prodromal features of PD than those without; of 23 possible prodromal features, the median number identified amongst participants with no SPMs was two, compared with four with one marker, five with two and seven with three (P < 0.001). Regarding individual SPMs, participants with depression and RBD endorsed five of 23 markers, compared with three for those with hyposmia (P = 0.001). There was no significant increase in the number of prodromal features amongst those with two SPMs compared with those with only one marker.

These impairments remain difficult to manage with current clinical therapies, but exercise has been identified as a possible treatment. The objective of this systematic review was to accumulate and analyze evidence for the effects of exercise on cognition in both animal models of PD and human disease. This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Fourteen original reports were identified, including six pre-clinical animal studies and eight human clinical studies. These studies used various exercise interventions and evaluated many different outcome measures; therefore, only a qualitative synthesis was performed. The evidence from animal studies supports the role of exercise to improve cognition in humans through the promotion of neuronal proliferation, neuroprotection and neurogenesis. These findings warrant more research to determine what roles these neural mechanisms play in clinical populations. The reports on cognitive changes in clinical studies demonstrate that a range of exercise programs can improve cognition in humans. While each clinical study demonstrated improvements in a marker of cognition, there were limitations in each study, including non-randomized designs and risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used and the quality of the evidence for human studies were rated from ""low"" to ""moderate"" and the strength of the recommendations were rated from ""weak"" to ""strong"". Studies that assessed executive function, compared to general cognitive abilities, received a higher GRADE rating. Overall, this systematic review found that in animal models exercise results in behavioral and corresponding neurobiological changes in the basal ganglia related to cognition. The clinical studies showed that various types of exercise, including aerobic, resistance and dance can improve cognitive function, although the optimal type, amount, mechanisms, and duration of exercise are unclear. With growing support for exercise to improve not only motor symptoms, but also cognitive impairments in PD, health care providers and policy makers should recommend exercise as part of routine management and neurorehabilitation for this disorder.","2014",,"Transl Neurodegener"," The objective of this systematic review was to accumulate and analyze evidence for the effects of exercise on cognition in both animal models of PD and human disease ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Olfactory impairment is seen in many neurodegenerative conditions, but it has been shown that those with dementia have particular difficulties with the recognition and identification of odours rather than the detection, suggesting a link to impairment of higher cognitive function. Olfactory impairment has been shown to be predictive of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease with 85.2% sensitivity. As cognitive function deteriorates, the world is experienced at a sensory level, with reduced ability to integrate the sensory experiences to understand the context. Thus, people with dementia are very sensitive to sensory experiences and their environment needs to be managed carefully to make it understandable, comfortable, and (if possible) therapeutic. Light can be used to stabilise the circadian rhythm, which may be disturbed in dementia.

In recent years it has been hypothesized that ApoE might play a role in the disintegration of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the present study we addressed the question if ApoE genotypes might be associated with BBB function measured by albumin ratio (QAlb) in a large cohort of patients with different types of dementia.
METHODS: Five hundred twenty (520) patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD, n = 350), Alzheimer's disease (n = 71) and cerebral small vessel disease (n = 99) were assessed for their ApoE genotype. BBB function was measured in all patients using QAlb and was compared between ApoE genotypes. Dominant and additive genetic models were assumed in order to investigate the potential effect of ApoE on BBB function.
RESULTS: We observed no systematic differences in QAlb between ApoE genotypes within the present study. Increased QAlb levels were shown for those without E3 allele in the subgroup of CJD patients when assuming a dominant genetic model (p = 0.035). This could not be confirmed for patients with other forms of dementia (p = 0.234).
DISCUSSION: Although there was some evidence for a protective effect of E3 alleles in CJD patients, this study does not support the hypothesis of a systematic role of ApoE genotypes in BBB function in individuals with a diagnosis of dementia. Thus, changes in BBB function do not seem to contribute to the increased risk of cognitive decline associated with certain ApoE genotypes.

OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of supervised, group-based, multidomain CCT on global cognition in older adults and to characterise the dose-response relationship during and after training.
DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, longitudinal, active-controlled trial.
SETTING: Community-based training centre in Sydney, Australia Participants: Eighty nondemented community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 72.1, 68.8% females) with multiple dementia risk factors but no major neuropsychiatric or sensory disorder. Of the 80 participants admitted to the study, 65 completed post-training assessment and 55 were followed up one year after training cessation.
INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-six group-based sessions over three months of either CCT targeting memory, speed, attention, language and reasoning tasks, or active control training comprising audiovisual educational exercises.
MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was change from baseline in global cognition as defined by a composite score of memory, speed and executive function. Secondary outcome was 15-month change in Bayer Activities of Daily Living from baseline to one year post-training.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed significant effects on global cognition in the cognitive training group compared to active control after three weeks of training (ES = 0.33, P=.039) that increased after 3 months of training (ES = 0.49, P=.003) and persisted three months after training cessation (ES = 0.30, P=0.023). Significant and durable improvements were also noted in memory and processing speed. Dose-response characteristics differed among cognitive domains.

MCI is associated with greater risk of progression to dementia; however, a substantial proportion of those identified with MCI have alternative outcomes including recovery to unimpaired status. This heterogeneity may in part reflect insufficient sensitivity and specificity in identifying subclinical memory impairment.
METHOD: The present study examined learning in a sample of 109 adults aged 61-91 years with persistent amnestic MCI, persistent non-amnestic MCI, recovered MCI and healthy controls. At the final assessment point, learning for words recalled across each trial of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was examined for each group.
RESULTS: It was found that persistent amnestic MCI participants displayed significantly lower learning compared with recovered MCI and healthy control groups.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study indicated that poor learning across trials may be a defining feature of persistent amnestic MCI. Further research is required to establish the predictive utility of within trial list learning performance to identify individuals with persistent and progressive variants of MCI.","2014",,"Eur J Neurol","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Previous research examining mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) has highlighted the heterogeneity of outcome in MCI sufferers ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Amnesia, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Disease Progression, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Different mechanisms are related to the pathogenesis of stroke, involving multiple biological systems, which are often inter-connected. Besides age, hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke and may also predispose to the development of more subtle cerebral damage based on arteriolar narrowing or pathological microvascular changes. Age and high blood pressure are responsible for silent structural and functional cerebral changes leading to white matter lesions and cognitive impairment. The clinical significance and pathological substrate of white matter lesions are not fully understood. Hypertensive patients have more white matter lesions, which are an important prognostic factor for the development of stroke, cognitive impairment, dementia and death, than normotensive people. Over the past 10 years, strong evidence has emerged that cerebral white matter lesions in hypertensive patients should be considered a silent early marker of brain damage. The mechanisms that would explain all these relationships remain to be elucidated, but available data suggest that arteriosclerosis of the penetrating brain vessels is the main factor in the pathogenesis of ischemic white matter lesions.","2014",,"Curr Med Chem",," review","Brain Ischemia, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Circadian Rhythm, FALSE, Essential Hypertension, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hypertension, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Risk Factors, FALSE, Stroke, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, White Matter, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

OBJECTIVE: This report further explores ICB symptom relationships with motor and mood phenotypes, the complex relationship with dopaminergic medications, and hypothesizes a model with potential clinical implications.
METHODS: Data from 500 PD patients were analyzed. Hypersexuality, gambling and shopping behaviour were assessed using selected questions from the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview questionnaire. Local questions assessed hobbyism. Motor characteristics considered were akinetic-rigid/gait disturbance (PIGD) and 'non-PIGD' phenotypes, motor severity, motor progression, and presence/absence of motor fluctuations. Other variables included anxiety, depression, current levodopa and agonist use, age, gender and cognition.
RESULTS: Overall, ICB symptom frequency was 17.8%. There was no relationship between PIGD/non-PIGD motor phenotypes and ICB symptoms. Those with ICB symptoms had higher total combined levodopa/agonist equivalent intake, but not current agonist-only equivalent intake. ICB symptoms were reported by 23.1% of those taking combined levodopa and agonist compared to 19.2% on agonist monotherapy and 11.6% levodopa monotherapy. Compared with non-ICB patients, patients with ICB symptoms were more likely to show an anxious mood phenotype, reported more motor fluctuations, and were younger.
CONCLUSIONS: Both PIGD and non-PIGD phenotypes are equally affected. Dose-related risk applies to total anti-parkinsonian medication and not just current agonist-only. Anxious mood phenotypes may carry increased risk. A role of anxiety, either as a marker of risk, indirect causal factor, or maintaining factor is incorporated into a preliminary model.

METHODS: We recruited 585 hypertensive patients (mean age, 73 years; 41% men) who were ambulatory, lived independently, and were without clinically overt dementia. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline, and CVD events (coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and sudden death) were prospectively ascertained. Cognitive dysfunction was defined as the lowest quartile of MMSE scores (n = 183, median 24 points).
RESULTS: CVD events occurred in 42 people over an average of 2.8 years (1644 person-years). The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction was higher in patients with CVD events than those without (57 vs. 29%; both P <0.001) at baseline. Cognitive dysfunction was associated with CVD events, after adjustment for nocturnal SBP and evidence of TOD [i.e. albuminuria, cardiac hypertrophy, and carotid-artery intima-media thickness (IMT)], hazard ratio 2.5-2.9 (all P <0.01). Incorporation of MMSE in the risk model (including age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and preexisting CVD) improved the C-statistics (from 0.691 to 0.741) and resulted in a net reclassification improvement of 17.6% (P = 0.02).

Perhaps the most important facet of idiopathic RBD is that it is a powerful prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Several prospective studies have now established that patients with idiopathic RBD have up to an 80% risk of developing a defined neurodegenerative synucleinopathy. This has profound implications for understanding and treating early disease. First, the extremely high risk and long latency/time to intervene make RBD patients the ideal candidates for neuroprotective therapy against synucleinopathy. Second, RBD patients can be used as a 'test lab' to assess other potential prodromal predictors of PD, which could be applied to the general population in future large-scale screening programs. Third, assessing epidemiology of RBD allows us to study the epidemiology of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies 10-15 years earlier, reducing bias and opening new hypotheses as to the mechanism of action of selected risk factors. Finally, by prospectively observing RBD patients as they transition to full neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, one has an unprecedented window in which to directly observe evolution of PD from its prodromal stages.

Decreased glucose metabolism with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a downstream marker of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. The risk of developing AD is higher in patients with aMCI who have a pattern of AD related glucose metabolic changes on FDG-PET than those who do not have these changes. We evaluated the utility of visual and 'statistical parametric mapping (SPM)-supported reading' of the FDG-PET scans of patients clinically classified as aMCI for identification of predementia patterns and for prediction of their progression to AD (PTAD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 35 patients diagnosed as aMCI (mini mental state examination (MMSE) score ≥ 25) at the cognitive disorders and memory (CDM) clinic of speciality neurology centers were referred for a resting FDG-PET study. All patients had a detailed neurological, neuropsychological, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation prior to referral. Mean age of patients was 67.9 ± 8.7 (standard deviation (SD)) years, male: female (M: F) =26:9. Twenty healthy age-matched controls were included in the study for SPM (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Scans were interpreted visually and using SPM. Each scan was classified as high, intermediate, or low likelihood for PTAD.
RESULTS: On visual analysis, four scans were classified as high likelihood of PTAD and reveled hypometabolism in AD related territories. Seven patients had hypometabolism in at least one AD related territory and were classified as intermediate likelihood for PTAD. Two patients had hypometabolism in other than AD territories, while 22 patients did not show any significant hypometabolism on their FDG-PET scans and were classified as low likelihood for PTAD. SPM analysis of these cases confirmed the areas hypometabolism in all 13 patients compared to a normal subgroup (P < 0.05). On follow-up of 24 months, all four cases with high likelihood scans had progression of cognitive deficits and were confirmed as AD in the CDM clinic while none of the others showed cognitive decline.

Idiopathic RBD is a very strong prodromal marker of Parkinson disease and other synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative syndromes. It is therefore critically important to understand whether antidepressant-associated RBD is an independent pharmacologic syndrome or a sign of possible prodromal neurodegeneration.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary sleep disorders center.
PARTICIPANTS: 100 patients with idiopathic RBD, all with diagnosis confirmed on polysomnography, stratified to baseline antidepressant use, with 45 matched controls.
MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS: Of 100 patients, 27 were taking antidepressants. Compared to matched controls, RBD patients taking antidepressants demonstrated significant abnormalities of 12/14 neurodegenerative markers tested, including olfaction (P = 0.007), color vision (P = 0.004), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale II and III (P < 0.001 and 0.007), timed up-and-go (P = 0.003), alternate tap test (P = 0.002), Purdue Pegboard (P = 0.007), systolic blood pressure drop (P = 0.029), erectile dysfunction (P = 0.002), constipation (P = 0.003), depression indices (P < 0.001), and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (13% vs. 60%, P < 0.001). All these abnormalities were indistinguishable in severity from RBD patients not taking antidepressants. However, on prospective follow-up, RBD patients taking antidepressants had a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative disease than those without antidepressant use (5-year risk = 22% vs. 59%, RR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with antidepressant-associated RBD have a lower risk of neurodegeneration than patients with ""purely-idiopathic"" RBD, markers of prodromal neurodegeneration are still clearly present.

METHODS: We sought to identify new PD susceptibility genes and to validate previously nominated candidate genes within the PARK10 region using a two-stage design. We used data from a large, publicly-available genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the discovery stage (n = 2000 cases and 1986 controls) and data from three independent studies for the replication stage (total n = 2113 cases and 2095 controls). Marker density was increased by imputation using HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes reference panels, and over 40,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in the final analysis. The association between each SNP and PD was modeled using logistic regression with an additive allele dosage effect and adjusted for sex, age, and axes of geographical variation.
RESULTS: Although the discovery stage yielded promising findings for SNPs in several novel genes, including DAB1, none of the results were validated in the replication stage. Furthermore, in meta-analyses across all datasets no genes within PARK10 reached significance after accounting for multiple testing.

Moreover, astrocytes are proving critical for normal CNS function, and alterations in their activity and impaired oxidative stress could contribute to diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction. Metabolic and oxidative insults often cause rapid changes in glial cells. Key indicators of this response are increased synthesis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as an astrocytic marker. Therefore, we examined the effects of berberine on glial reactivity of hippocampus in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, using GFAP immunohistochemistry. Lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and nitrite levels were assessed as the parameters of oxidative stress. Eight weeks after diabetes induction, we observed increased numbers of GFAP(+) astrocytes immunostaining associated with increased lipid peroxidation, decreased superoxide dismutase activity, and elevated nitrite levels in the hippocampus of STZ-diabetic rats. In contrast, chronic treatment with berberine (50 and 100 mg/kg p.o. once daily) lowered hyperglycemia, reduced oxidative stress, and prevented the upregulation of GFAP in the brain of diabetic rats.

METHODS: Thirty patients with MCI and 28 age-matched controls underwent psychiatric, medical, and neuropsychological assessment, followed by overnight polysomnography and dim light melatonin onset assessment.

Dim light melatonin onset was computed using a standardized algorithm, and area under the curve was computed for melatonin secretion. Sleep architecture measures including wake after sleep onset and latency to rapid eye movement sleep were derived.
RESULTS: Patients with MCI had advanced timing of their melatonin secretion onset relative to controls, but the levels of melatonin secreted did not differ between groups. The MCI group also had greater wake after sleep onset and increased rapid eye movement sleep latency. There were differential associations between dim light melatonin onset and cognition between the two groups, with earlier dim light melatonin onset being associated with poorer memory performance in MCI patients.

METHODS: We used liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to establish an association specifically between deficiency of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 and PD in a cross-sectional and longitudinal case-control study of 388 patients (mean Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.1 ± 0.6) and 283 control subjects free of neurologic disease nested in the Harvard Biomarker Study.
RESULTS: Plasma levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 were associated with PD in both univariate and multivariate analyses with p values = 0.0034 and 0.047, respectively. Total 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels, the traditional composite measure of endogenous and exogenous vitamin D, were deficient in 17.6% of patients with PD compared with 9.3% of controls. Low 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 as well as total 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels were correlated with higher total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores at baseline and during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals an association between 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 and PD and suggests that thousands of patients with PD in North America alone may be vitamin D-deficient.

In the present study, we determined the activity of distinct PLA₂ subgroups (iPLA₂, sPLA₂ and cPLA₂) in older adults with MCI as compared to patients with mild dementia due to AD and to cognitively healthy controls. We investigated whether decreased PLA₂ activity at baseline is associated with the progression of MCI to AD upon follow-up during a period of 4 years. The activity of PLA₂ subgroups was determined in platelets from 169 elderly adults. Progression of MCI to AD was ascertained by standard clinical criteria for AD upon follow-up. At baseline, iPLA₂ activity was significantly decreased (p = 0.001) in patients with AD and MCI as compared to controls. Patients with MCI who progressed to AD during follow-up showed significantly lower iPLA₂ activity at baseline as compared to patients with MCI who did not progress to AD (p = 0.009). Moreover, subjects from the control group at baseline who progressed to MCI during follow-up had lower sPLA₂ and cPLA₂ (p = 0.014 and p = 0.009, respectively).

A secondary aim was to examine the clinical and demographic predictors of depressive symptoms across these groups.
METHODS: The study was conducted at an academic neurology subspecialty clinic. This was a case-control study with 140 Chinese-American subjects and 140 demographically and cognitively matched white subjects. In each group, there were 48 cognitively normal and 92 cognitively impaired participants (49 with mild cognitive impairment, 43 with Alzheimer disease). The proportion of individuals with significant depressive symptoms, as indicated by a Geriatric Depression Scale score ≥6 of 15, and frequency of antidepressant use were compared across groups by using χ(2) analysis. Factors predicting depressive symptoms, including racial and diagnostic group, age, gender, Mini-Mental State Examination score, level of functional impairment, education level, and medical comorbidities, were assessed by using linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Significant depressive symptoms were more common in cognitively impaired Chinese-American (35%) than cognitively impaired white (15%; χ(2)[1] = 9.4; p = 0.004) subjects. Chinese-American subjects with cognitive impairment were less likely to be receiving treatment for depression (12%) than white subjects with cognitive impairment (37%; χ(2)[1] = 15.6; p = 0.002). Racial and diagnostic group, age, level of functional impairment, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and education level were all statistically significant independent predictors of Geriatric Depression Scale score.

We hypothesized that education, a marker of cognitive reserve (CR), could modulate the effects of WML on the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.
METHODS: We followed 500 healthy subjects from a cohort of community-dwelling persons aged 65 years and over (ESPRIT Project). At baseline, WML volume was measured using a semi-automatic method on T2-weighted MRI. Standardized cognitive and neurological evaluations were repeated after 2, 4, and 7 years. The sample was dichotomized according to education level into low (≤8 years) and high (>8 years) education groups. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to study the association between WML and risk of MCI/dementia.
RESULTS: The interaction between education level and WML volume reached significance (p = 0.017). After adjustment for potential confounders, the association between severe WML and increased MCI/dementia risk was significant in the low education group (≤8 years) (p = 0.02, hazard ratio [HR]: 3.77 [1.29-10.99]), but not in the high education group (>8 years) (p = 0.82, HR: 1.07 [0.61-1.87]).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe WML significantly increases the risk of developing MCI/dementia over a 7-year period in low educated participants.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and long-term outcome of preclinical Alzheimer's disease according to these criteria.
METHODS: Participants were cognitively normal (clinical dementia rating [CDR]=0) community-dwelling volunteers aged at least 65 years who were enrolled between 1998 and 2011 at the Washington University School of Medicine (MO, USA). CSF amyloid-β1-42 and tau concentrations and a memory composite score were used to classify participants as normal (both markers normal), preclinical Alzheimer's disease stage 1-3, or suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology (SNAP, abnormal injury marker without abnormal amyloid marker). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants in each preclinical AD stage. Secondary outcomes included progression to CDR at least 0·5, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (score of at least 0·5 for memory and at least one other domain and cognitive impairments deemed to be due to Alzheimer's disease), and mortality. We undertook survival analyses using subdistribution and standard Cox hazards models and linear mixed models.
FINDINGS: Of 311 participants, 129 (41%) were classed as normal, 47 (15%) as stage 1, 36 (12%) as stage 2, 13 (4%) as stage 3, 72 (23%) as SNAP, and 14 (5%) remained unclassified. The 5-year progression rate to CDR at least 0·5, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease was 2% for participants classed as normal, 11% for stage 1, 26% for stage 2, 56% for stage 3, and 5% for SNAP. Compared with individuals classed as normal, participants with preclinical Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio 6·2, 95% CI 1·1-35·0; p=0·040).
INTERPRETATION: Preclinical Alzheimer's disease is common in cognitively normal elderly people and is associated with future cognitive decline and mortality. Thus, preclinical Alzheimer's disease could be an important target for therapeutic intervention.

The etiology of this disease is still not fully clear, but free radicals have been proposed to cause neuronal injury. Metals play a key role in the intracellular oxidative balance. However their implication in the degeneration process remains unknown.
AIM: To assess Cu, Zn and Se concentrations in serum of a group of PD patients in order to determinate, in comparison with age-matched controls, whether alteration in their levels could be involved in PD.
METHODS: A serum level of 3 trace elements (Cu, Zn and Se) was investigated in 48 patients with PD and 36 matched controls using plasma atomic absorption spectrometry. We compared these parameters in PD patients with controls, and we also compared the variations within the PD group according to age, illness duration, stage of the disease and levodopa intake.
RESULTS: Patients with PD had significantly lower Cu levels compared to controls. The mean Zn and Se levels in PD patients did not differ significantly from those of controls. Levodopa therapy, age, stage, and illness duration did not significantly influence the measured parameters.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a disturbance of the plasmatic rate of Cu could be a marker of PD or at least, a risk factor for the development of this disease. Although zinc participates to the reduction of oxidative stress and the antioxidant role of the selenium, their implication in the onset of PD is not clearly established.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed the presence of deep vein thrombosis using bilateral leg Doppler ultrasonography in 114 asymptomatic outpatients with Parkinson's disease.
RESULTS: Deep vein thrombosis was detected in 23 patients (20%) with Parkinson's disease. Deep vein thrombosis was located in the distal portion in 18 patients and in the proximal portion in 5 patients. No significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr stage, anti-Parkinson's drugs, or daily levodopa-equivalent dose were seen between deep vein thrombosis-positive and -negative groups. Univariate analysis for developing deep vein thrombosis in patients with Parkinson's disease identified the following markers: long-term wheelchair use, bent knee, bent spine, and D-dimer elevation. Bending angles were significantly greater in the deep vein thrombosis-positive group at the knee and spine than in the deep vein thrombosis-negative group. Half of Parkinson's disease patients with camptocormia had deep vein thrombosis. Among diabetes mellitus cases, long-term wheelchair use, bent knee over 15°, camptocormia, D-dimer elevation, the more risk markers were associated with a higher incidence of DVT. The presence of risk markers contributed to the development of deep vein thrombosis. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a bent knee posture was strongly associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis.

METHODS: Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques, we measured circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from study participants, selected from a cohort of 282 subjects, who were classified according to their concentrations of amyloid β1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau and by the presence or absence of dementia, into asymptomatic subjects at risk of AD, symptomatic patients diagnosed with sporadic AD, presymptomatic subjects carrying pathogenic PSEN1 mutations, and patients diagnosed with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). We performed equivalent studies in a separate validation cohort of sporadic AD and FTLD patients. In addition, we measured mtDNA copy number in cultured cortical neurons from mutant amyloid precursor protein/presenilin1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice.
RESULTS: Asymptomatic patients at risk of AD and symptomatic AD patients, but not FTLD patients, exhibit a significant decrease in circulating cell-free mtDNA in the CSF. These observations were confirmed in the validation cohort. In addition, presymptomatic subjects carrying pathogenic PSEN1 gene mutations show low mtDNA content in CSF before the appearance of AD-related biomarkers in CSF. Moreover, mtDNA content in CSF discriminates with high sensitivity and specificity AD patients from either controls or patients with FTLD. Furthermore, cultured cortical neurons from APP/PS1 transgenic mice have fewer mtDNA copies before the appearance of altered synaptic markers.

The influence of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and TOMM40 was assessed by 2 × 2 ANOVAs and partial correlations. There was no effect of APOE and TOMM40 on EM performance and HC volume. However, partial correlations revealed that HC volume was positively associated with free recall performance (r = 0.21, p < 0.01, r (2) = 0.04).

CCD manifests as alterations of behavioral patterns and daily routines. Clinical signs are associated with neurodegenerative changes (eg, cortical atrophy and amyloid-beta deposits).
OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical characteristics, survival, and risk factors with CCD. Vitamin E was investigated as a potential marker of CCD.
METHODS: Ninety-four dogs >8 years of age were investigated with a validated CCD questionnaire and allocated to CCD, borderline CCD (b-CCD) and non-CCD groups. The dogs were included in 2008-2009 and followed up in an observational study until follow-up in 2012.
RESULTS: Four key clinical signs dominated in dogs with CCD: sleeping during the day and restless at night, decreased interaction, disorientation at home, and anxiety. A number of borderline CCD cases developed into CCD over time indicating that a prodromal stage of CCD may exist. CCD did not influence survival negatively. Small breeds did not show better survival than large breeds (P = .055) and there was no difference between sexes (P = .99).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A few key questions addressing sleep-wake cycle, interaction, and signs of confusion and anxiety can be used as a clinical marker of CCD.

We tested the association between enlarged perivascular spaces and ischemic stroke subtype, other markers of small vessel disease, and common vascular risk factors.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with acute stroke, diagnosed and subtyped by a stroke physician using clinical features and brain magnetic resonance imaging. A neuroradiologist rated basal ganglia and centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces on a five-point scale, white matter lesions, recent and old infarcts, and cerebral atrophy. We assessed associations between basal ganglia-, centrum semiovale- and total (combined basal ganglia and centrum semiovale) enlarged perivascular spaces, stroke subtype, white matter lesions, atrophy, and vascular risk factors.
RESULTS: Among 298 patients (mean age 68 years), after adjusting for vascular risk factors and white matter lesions, basal ganglia-enlarged perivascular spaces were associated with increasing age (P = 0.001), centrum semiovale-enlarged perivascular spaces (P < 0.001), cerebral atrophy (P = 0.03), and lacunar stroke subtype (P = 0.04). Centrum semiovale-enlarged perivascular spaces were associated mainly with basal ganglia-enlarged perivascular spaces. Total enlarged perivascular spaces were associated with increasing age (P = 0.01), deep white matter lesions (P = 0.005), and previous stroke (P = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Enlarged perivascular spaces are associated with age, lacunar stroke subtype and white matter lesions and should be considered as another magnetic resonance imaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of different clinical forms of AF on plasma concentrations of vWF at different levels of the circulatory tree, both intracardiac and extracardiac.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Peripheral (Pf), left atrial (LA), and coronary sinus (CS) blood samples were obtained during cardiac catheterization from 52 patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF), 36 with persistent AF (PsAF), and 17 control subjects (Ct) with left-sided accessory pathway Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Plasma concentrations of vWF were determined by immunoturbidimetry. Compared with Ct, patients with PAF had higher LA plasma levels of vWF (P = 0.004), but similar Pf and CS levels (both P > 0.30). In contrast, patients with PsAF had higher plasma concentrations of vWF in Pf (P = 0.04), LA (P < 0.001), and CS (P = 0.04) samples compared with Ct. Left atrial plasma concentrations of vWF in patients with PsAF were also higher than in the PAF group (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Regardless of the clinical form of the arrhythmia, AF patients presented significantly higher plasma concentrations of vWF compared with sinus rhythm controls.

We hypothesized that both elevated depressive symptoms and a behavioral correlate of depression, low leisure satisfaction, are associated with systemic inflammation.
METHOD: We studied 121 elderly Alzheimer's disease caregivers who underwent 4 annual assessments for depressive symptoms, leisure satisfaction, and circulating levels of inflammatory markers. We used mixed-regression analyses controlling for sociodemographic and health-relevant covariates to examine longitudinal relationships between constructs of interest.
RESULTS: There were inverse relationships between total leisure satisfaction and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; p = .047), interleukin-8 (IL-8; p < .001), and interferon-γ (IFG; p = .020) but not with IL-6 (p = .21) and C-reactive protein (p = .65). Lower enjoyment from leisure activities was related to higher levels of TNF-α (p = .045), IL-8 (p < .001), and IFG (p = .002), whereas lower frequency of leisure activities was related only to higher IL-8 levels (p = .023). Depressive symptoms were not associated with any inflammatory marker (all p values > .17). Depressive symptoms did not mediate the relationship between leisure satisfaction and inflammation.

,"23642578","Relevance of magnetic resonance imaging for early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.","Teipel SJ","Hippocampus volumetry currently is the best-established imaging biomarker for AD. However, the effect of multicenter acquisition on measurements of hippocampus volume needs to be explicitly considered when it is applied in large clinical trials, for example by using mixed-effects models to take the clustering of data within centers into account. The marker needs further validation in respect of the underlying neurobiological substrate and potential confounds such as vascular disease, inflammation, hydrocephalus, and alcoholism, and with regard to clinical outcomes such as cognition but also to demographic and socioeconomic outcomes such as mortality and institutionalization. The use of hippocampus volumetry for risk stratification of predementia study samples will further increase with the availability of automated measurement approaches. An important step in this respect will be the development of a standard hippocampus tracing protocol that harmonizes the large range of presently available manual protocols. In the near future, regionally differentiated automated methods will become available together with an appropriate statistical model, such as multivariate analysis of deformation fields, or techniques such as cortical-thickness measurements that yield a meaningful metrics for the detection of treatment effects. More advanced imaging protocols, including DTI, DSI, and functional MRI, are presently being used in monocenter and first multicenter studies. In the future these techniques will be relevant for the risk stratification in phase IIa type studies (small proof-of-concept trials). By contrast, the application of the broader established structural imaging biomarkers, such as hippocampus volume, for risk stratification and as surrogate end point is already today part of many clinical trial protocols. However, clinical care will also be affected by these new technologies. Radiologic expert centers already offer “dementia screening” for well-off middle-aged people who undergo an MRI scan with subsequent automated, typically VBM-based analysis, and determination of z-score deviation from a matched control cohort. Next-generation scanner software will likely include radiologic expert systems for automated segmentation, deformation-based morphometry, and multivariate analysis of anatomic MRI scans for the detection of a typical AD pattern. As these developments will start to change medical practice, first for selected subject groups that can afford this type of screening but later eventually also for other cohorts, clinicians must become aware of the potentials and limitations of these technologies. It is decidedly unclear to date how a middle-aged cognitively intact subject with a seemingly AD-positive MRI scan should be clinically advised. There is no evidence for individual risk prediction and even less for specific treatments. Thus, the development of preclinical diagnostic imaging poses not only technical but also ethical problems that must be critically discussed on the basis of profound knowledge. From a neurobiological point of view, the main determinants of cognitive impairment in AD are the density of synapses and neurons in distributed cortical and subcortical networks. MRI-based measures of regional gray matter volume and associated multivariate analysis techniques of regional interactions of gray matter densities provide insight into the onset and temporal dynamics of cortical atrophy as a close proxy for regional neuronal loss and a basis of functional impairment in specific neuronal networks. From the clinical point of view, clinicians must bear in mind that patients do not suffer from hippocampus atrophy or disconnection but from memory impairment, and that dementia screening in asymptomatic subjects should not be used outside of clinical studies.","2013",,"Med Clin North Am",," review","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Asymptomatic Diseases, TRUE, Atrophy, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Diagnosis, Differential, FALSE, Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, TRUE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Early Diagnosis, TRUE, Hippocampus, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Multivariate Analysis, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Nerve Net, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Neurons, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Organ Size, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming an international priority. Neocortical Aβ (extracellular β-amyloid) burden (NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma measures between high and low NAB groups, and cross-validated machine-learning models were generated for predicting NAB. These models were applied to 817 non-imaged AIBL subjects and 82 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for validation. Five analytes showed significant difference between subjects with high compared to low NAB. A machine-learning model (based on nine markers) achieved sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 82%, respectively, for predicting NAB. Validation using the ADNI cohort yielded similar results (sensitivity 79% and specificity 76%). These results show that a panel of blood-based biomarkers is able to accurately predict NAB, supporting the hypothesis for a relationship between a blood-based signature and Aβ accumulation, therefore, providing a platform for developing a population-based screen.","2014",,"Mol Psychiatry",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Aniline Compounds, FALSE, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Chemokine CCL3, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Cullin Proteins, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Interleukin-17, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neocortex, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Pancreatic Polypeptide, FALSE, Positron-Emission Tomography, FALSE, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, ROC Curve, FALSE, Thiazoles, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Cross-sectional studies indicate that a proportion of iRBD patients show cognitive deficits similar to those typically found in patients with synucleinopathies. The available longitudinal data suggest that cognitive dysfunction in iRBD tends to progress over time, with this progression probably being underpinned by a neurodegenerative process. Furthermore, within the framework of Parkinson's disease, RBD has been shown to be a risk factor for progressive cognitive decline even advancing to dementia. This paper addresses the multifaceted issue of cognitive dysfunction in RBD. Taking into account some key literature findings and preliminary longitudinal observations of our own, it shows that cognitive deterioration, mainly involving visuospatial abilities (learning as a stable deficit and copying as an evolving deficit), non-verbal logic, attention and executive functions can be observed in iRBD follow-up, suggesting an underlying evolving degenerative process.

We tested the hypothesis that perivascular spaces are associated with atherosclerosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants from the Northern Manhattan Study who remained stroke-free were invited to participate in an MR imaging substudy. Parenchymal hypointensities of <3 mm identified on brain axial T1-weighted MR imaging were scored as perivascular spaces. A semiquantitative score was created to express the degree of brain involvement. Generalized linear models were used to assess statistical associations with carotid plaque as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: The studied sample included 706 participants (mean age, 72.6 ± 8.0 years; 60% women, 61% Hispanic, 68% with hypertension, 19% with diabetes, and 57% with high cholesterol). The perivascular spaces score ranged from 0 to 19 with 52% of the sample having a perivascular spaces score of ≤4. In unadjusted analysis, perivascular spaces were associated with age (β = 0.01 per year, P = < .001), non-Hispanic black race-ethnicity (β = 0.16, P = .02), hypertension (β = 0.24, P = < .001), and carotid plaque (β = 0.22, P < .001). In multivariable analysis, only age (β = 0.01, P = .02), hypertension (β = 0.17, P = .01), and carotid plaque (β = 0.22, P = < .001) remained independently associated with perivascular spaces.
CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular spaces were more frequently found in older participants, in those with hypertension, and in the presence of carotid plaque. These results suggest that mechanisms leading to atherosclerosis might also lead to an increased number of perivascular spaces.

In the present study, we investigated the attenuating effects of oligomerised lychee fruit-derived polyphenol (OLFP, also called Oligonol) on early cognitive impairment. Male senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice (4 months old) were given OLFP (100 mg/kg per d) for 2 months, and then conditioned fear memory testing was conducted. Contextual fear memory, which is considered hippocampus-dependent memory, was significantly impaired in SAMP8 mice compared with non-senescence-accelerated mice. OLFP attenuated cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice. Moreover, the results of real-time PCR analysis that followed DNA array analysis in the hippocampus revealed that, compared with SAMP8 mice, the mRNA expression of Wolfram syndrome 1 (Wfs1) was significantly higher in SAMP8 mice administered with OLFP. Wfs1 reportedly helps to protect against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is thought to be one of the causes for AD. The expression of Wfs1 was significantly up-regulated in NG108-15 neuronal cells by the treatment with OLFP, and the up-regulation was inhibited by the treatment of the cells with a c-Jun N-terminal kinase-specific inhibitor rather than with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor. Moreover, OLFP significantly attenuated the tunicamycin-induced expression of the ER stress marker BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein) in the cells.

Neurophysiological markers are usually not considered as such criteria, although theoretical and practical reasons would justify them. In order to assess the value of neurophysiology as an AD biomarker, whole-head magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting state recordings were obtained from 35 AD patients, 23 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 24 healthy controls. The AD group was further split into two groups differing in severity according to the GDS/FAST criteria. A Minimum Norm Estimation procedure was utilized to estimate the cortical origin of slow brain oscillatory activity in the delta band (2-4 Hz). Eight regions of interest (ROIs) discriminated between AD patients and controls. Delta current density (DCD) in all ROIs showed a significant negative correlation with cognitive status (p < 0.001). DCD values in posterior parietal, occipital, prerolandic, and precuneus cortices distinguished reliably between MCI patients, AD patients with different severity scores, and controls. Importantly, an increase of DCD in right parietal cortex and precuneus indexed the transition from MCI to mild dementia and from mild to more severe dementia. MEG delta mapping might be a serious candidate for a ""neural degeneration"" marker of AD reflecting dysfunctional synaptic transmission. More importantly, the localization of DCD values is in line with functional imaging markers of AD. However, MEG delta mapping is a totally non-invasive technique that directly measures neural activity.

We investigated the relationship between thyroid hormones and mortality during hospitalization and in a prolonged follow-up in frail older patients.
METHODS: A nonconcurrent cohort study was conducted by enrolling 450 participants hospitalized for an acute disease, who were classified into four groups (euthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and low triiodothyronine [T3] syndrome), according to clinical and laboratory data. Multidimensional geriatric assessment variables were considered in order to identify short- and long-term predictors of death.
RESULTS: Participants were very old (mean age: 84 years) and frail, as indicated by severely impaired functional status, extensive comorbidity, high prevalence of dementia, and hospital mortality (8%). Prevalence of any thyroid dysfunction was 40.7%; 32% of participants had low T3 syndrome, which was associated with an excess hospital mortality risk (odds ratio: 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-6.5; p = .025), adjusted for demographic, clinical, functional, and laboratory data. Conversely, long-term mortality was unrelated to low T3 syndrome. In euthyroid participants, increasing levels of free thyroxine (FT4) were associated with a slightly greater mortality (hazard ratio, CI: 2.12, 0.99-4.54; p = .053) in adjusted Cox regression models.
CONCLUSIONS: This observational study on a cohort of very old, frail hospitalized patients gives support to the independent prognostic short-term, but not long-term, role of low T3 syndrome.

The aim of the current study is to determine the effects of several psychosocial factors on the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as to identify potential pre-motor symptoms for PD in a large prospective cohort study.
METHODS: In 1991-1993, a total of 9955 women and men free of PD from the Copenhagen City Heart Study were asked about major life events, economic hardship, social network, impaired sleep and vital exhaustion. The participants were followed for first-time hospitalization with PD in nationwide registers until 2011.
RESULTS: Vital exhaustion was associated with a higher risk of PD hospitalization in an exposure-dependent manner (P(trend) = 0.001), with high vs. low vital exhaustion being associated with a hazard ratio of 2.50 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-4.89]. A slightly higher risk of PD hospitalization (hazard ratio = 1.49; 95% CI: 0.87-2.56) was suggested in participants with impaired sleep at baseline. No more than weak associations were observed for economic hardship, major life events or inadequate social network in the current study.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the hypothesis that psychosocial risk factors affect the risk of PD is not supported. The results, however, suggest that vital exhaustion may be a pre-motor marker of the neurodegenerative process eventually leading to motor symptoms and clinical PD. Vital exhaustion may be useful for screening aimed at early detection and when considering disease-modifying therapies in people at high risk of clinical PD.","2013",,"Eur J Neurol","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Experimental studies support a link between stress and development of parkinsonian symptoms , but prospective population studies are lacking ","other","Adult, FALSE, Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Denmark, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Educational Status, FALSE, Fatigue, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Hospitalization, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Humans, FALSE, Life Change Events, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sex Factors, FALSE, Sleep Wake Disorders, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Smoking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Social Environment, TRUE, Social Support, FALSE, Socioeconomic Factors, FALSE, Stress, Psychological, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Young Adult, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Notably, molecular pathways related to α-synuclein, tau and β-amyloid peptides have received considerable attention. CSF levels of the protein DJ-1 are also of interest, although further investigation of this candidate marker is required. These studies support the usefulness of a combination of various CSF biomarkers of PD to increase diagnostic accuracy during early phases of the disease, and to differentiate PD from other neurodegenerative disorders.","2013",,"Nat Rev Neurol"," Accordingly , research efforts aimed at identification of novel biomarkers have been increasing in the past 5 years "," review","Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Biomarkers, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Disease Progression, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Intermediate Filament Proteins, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Oncogene Proteins, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Protein Deglycase DJ-1, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The frequency of GBA mutations in unselected Parkinson's disease populations has not been established. Furthermore, no previous studies have investigated the influence of GBA mutations on the natural history of Parkinson's disease using prospective follow-up. We studied DNA from 262 cases who had been recruited at diagnosis into one of two independent community-based incidence studies of Parkinson's disease. In 121 cases, longitudinal data regarding progression of motor disability and cognitive function were derived from follow-up assessments conducted every 18 months for a median of 71 months. Sequencing of the GBA was performed after two-stage polymerase chain reaction amplification. The carrier frequency of genetic variants in GBA was determined. Baseline demographic and clinical variables were compared between cases who were either GBA mutation carriers, polymorphism carriers or wild-type homozygotes. Cox regression analysis was used to model progression to major motor (Hoehn and Yahr stage 3), and cognitive (dementia) end-points in cases followed longitudinally. We show that in a representative, unselected UK Parkinson's disease population, GBA mutations are present at a frequency of 3.5%. This is higher than the prevalence of other genetic mutations currently associated with Parkinson's disease and indicates that GBA mutations make an important contribution to Parkinson's disease encountered in the community setting. Baseline clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between cases with and without GBA sequence variants. However, the hazard ratio for progression both to dementia (5.7, P = 0.003) and Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 (4.2, P = 0.003) were significantly greater in GBA mutation carriers. We also show that carriers of polymorphisms in GBA which are not generally considered to increase Parkinson's disease risk are at significantly increased risk of progression to Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 (3.2, P = 0.004). Our results indicate that genetic variation in GBA has an important impact on the natural history of Parkinson's disease. To our knowledge, this is the first time a genetic locus has been shown to influence motor progression in Parkinson's disease. If confirmed in further studies, this may indicate that GBA mutation status could be used as a prognostic marker in Parkinson's disease. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this effect will further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and may in turn suggest novel therapeutic strategies.","2013",,"Brain"," We studied DNA from 262 cases who had been recruited at diagnosis into one of two independent community-based incidence studies of Parkinson's disease ","other","Aged, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Genetic Variation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Glucosylceramidase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Population Surveillance, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Residence Characteristics, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The aim of this paper is to analyze the frequency and association of both conditions in a sample of outpatients with PD. A total of 111 patients, diagnosed with PD, were studied. Disease duration, treatment, cardiovascular risk factors, UPDRS I-IV and Scopa Aut scale scores were reported. Subjects underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring and were assessed for orthostatic hypotension. We compared our results with those published in 17,219 patients using the same protocol and the same type of device. Overall, 71.1 % had no proper circadian rhythm. This frequency was significantly higher than that of the control population (48 %). The prevalence of the nondipper or riser patterns was higher in patients with orthostatic hypotension (77.8 vs. 66.7 %). There was a correlation between nightly increases in diastolic blood pressure and changes in BP during the orthostatic test. Patients taking higher doses of treatment had less decreases in SBP (cc:-0.25; p = 0.007) and DBP (cc:-0.33; p < 0.001) at night, however there was no relation with drug type. The majority of patients with Parkinson's disease show an altered circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Patients with a non-dipper or riser pattern on 24 h ABPM exhibited a higher prevalence of autonomic disorders (orthostatic hypotension) and received higher doses of dopaminergic treatment.

,"23394771","A robust and efficient statistical method for genetic association studies using case and control samples from multiple cohorts.","Wang M","BACKGROUND: The theoretical basis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is statistical inference of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between any polymorphic marker and a putative disease locus. Most methods widely implemented for such analyses are vulnerable to several key demographic factors and deliver a poor statistical power for detecting genuine associations and also a high false positive rate. Here, we present a likelihood-based statistical approach that accounts properly for non-random nature of case-control samples in regard of genotypic distribution at the loci in populations under study and confers flexibility to test for genetic association in presence of different confounding factors such as population structure, non-randomness of samples etc.
RESULTS: We implemented this novel method together with several popular methods in the literature of GWAS, to re-analyze recently published Parkinson's disease (PD) case-control samples. The real data analysis and computer simulation show that the new method confers not only significantly improved statistical power for detecting the associations but also robustness to the difficulties stemmed from non-randomly sampling and genetic structures when compared to its rivals. In particular, the new method detected 44 significant SNPs within 25 chromosomal regions of size < 1 Mb but only 6 SNPs in two of these regions were previously detected by the trend test based methods. It discovered two SNPs located 1.18 Mb and 0.18 Mb from the PD candidates, FGF20 and PARK8, without invoking false positive risk.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel likelihood-based method which provides adequate estimation of LD and other population model parameters by using case and control samples, the ease in integration of these samples from multiple genetically divergent populations and thus confers statistically robust and powerful analyses of GWAS. On basis of simulation studies and analysis of real datasets, we demonstrated significant improvement of the new method over the non-parametric trend test, which is the most popularly implemented in the literature of GWAS.","2013",,"BMC Genomics",,"other","Algorithms, FALSE, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Computer Simulation, FALSE, Databases, Factual, FALSE, Fibroblast Growth Factors, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Genome-Wide Association Study, TRUE, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2, FALSE, Likelihood Functions, FALSE, Linkage Disequilibrium, FALSE, Models, Statistical, TRUE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We aimed to determine the adenosine response in pediatric patients with WPW pattern on ECG and whether blocked accessory pathway (AP) conduction with adenosine correlated with nonrapid AP conduction measured by invasive electrophysiology study (EPS).
METHODS: All patients with WPW ≤ 18 years of age who underwent EPS over a 5-year period were identified. The adenosine response during atrial pacing was characterized as blocked or continued AP conduction. Invasive data were obtained during atrial pacing and atrial fibrillation. Conduction through the AP to a cycle length ≤ 250 ms was considered rapid; otherwise patients were nonrapid. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive value were calculated for blocked AP conduction to identify nonrapid baseline AP conduction during EPS.
RESULTS: There were 59 patients included and nine (15%) had blocked AP conduction with adenosine. Five of these nine had WPW syndrome and four had fasciculoventricular APs. All nine patients had nonrapid conduction on baseline EPS. Blocked AP conduction with adenosine as a marker of nonrapid baseline AP conduction had a specificity of 100%, a PPV of 100%.

However, the prevalence rate of dementia among persons with CHF in very old individuals has not been previously reported, and little is known about the comorbidities that place old persons with CHF at a higher risk for dementia. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of dementia in individuals 80 years or older who have CHF with that in individuals without CHF and to identify factors related to dementia in individuals diagnosed with CHF.
METHODS: A total of 702 participants from a Swedish population-based longitudinal study (Octogenerian Twin) were included. The group consisted of same-sex twin pairs, age 80 years or older, and 138 participants had CHF. Dementia was diagnosed according to criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised. Generalized estimating equations including gender, age and educational level, waist circumference, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, depression, and blood values were used in a case-control analysis.
RESULTS: Individuals with CHF had a significantly higher prevalence of vascular dementia, 16% vs 6% (P < 0.001), and of all types of dementia, 40% vs 30% (P < 0.01), than those not diagnosed with CHF. The generalized estimating equation models showed that depression, hypertension, and/or increased levels of homocysteine were all associated with a higher risk for dementia in individuals with CHF. Diabetes was specifically associated with an increased risk for vascular dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of dementia was higher among individuals with CHF than in those without CHF. Diabetes, depression, and hypertension in patients with CHF require special attention from healthcare professionals because these conditions are associated with an elevated risk for dementia.

METHOD: A sample of 602 non-demented community dwelling individuals (375 CN and 227 with MCI) aged 70-90 years underwent baseline and 24-month assessments that included cognitive and medical assessments and an interview with a knowledgeable informant on functional abilities with the Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale.
RESULTS: Significantly more deficits in informant-reported IADL with high cognitive demand were present in MCI compared with CN individuals at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Functional ability in CN individuals at baseline, particularly in activities with high cognitive demand, predicted MCI and dementia at follow-up. Difficulties with highly cognitively demanding activities specifically predicted amnestic MCI but not non-amnestic MCI whereas those with low cognitive demand did not predict MCI or dementia.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study, in a large urban acute general hospital, of 616 people (70 years and older) with unplanned medical admission. The principal exposure was DSM-IV dementia and main outcome mortality risk. Dementia severity was analysed by using the Functional Assessment Staging scale. We examined a range of modifying variables: acute physiological disturbance (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), chronic comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index, CCI) and pressure sore risk (Waterlow score).
RESULTS: A total 42.4% of the cohort had dementia. Nearly half (48.3%) had died 12 months after admission (median survival time 1.1 years compared with 2.7 years in people without dementia). Unadjusted hazard ratios for mortality in people with dementia was 1.66 (95% CI 1.35-2.04) and for people with moderately severe/severe dementia 2.01 (95% CI 1.57-2.57).

It is a significant predictor of poor outcomes including mortality and institutionalisation, however it is often viewed as simply a marker of underlying illness and is frequently overlooked in older adults. Although delirium is commonly comorbid with dementia, it represents a more urgent diagnosis, requiring prompt intervention. Delirium presents most commonly with hypoactive features (e.g. withdrawal and reduced spontaneous movement and speech). The common stereotype of hyperactive delirium tremens (e.g. agitation, hallucinations), although more visible, is less common. All presentations share acute disimprovement of cognitive function. Delirium is a highly predictable and preventable occurrence, however a major barrier to improving delirium care and impacting upon outcomes is that it remains poorly detected, particularly in surgical populations and especially in patients with hypoactive presentations. Routine ward-based screening for delirium, particularly in high-risk populations, and improved staff awareness of the significance of the problem can improve detection rates. Preventative strategies, particularly multicomponent approaches, have been most efficacious in improving patient outcomes. Optimising perioperative risk factors can lead to reduced incidence. Appropriate treatment of delirium requires thorough investigation, management of the underlying illness, avoidance of complications and simplification of the care environment. Studies suggest a role for pharmacological prophylaxis, particularly in relation to anaesthetic and sedative agents used intra- and post-operatively.

A secondary aim was to examine the relationship of physical exercise capacity in midlife with the risk of dementia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective follow-up study was carried out on individuals (mean age 50 years, 66% men) referred to a symptom-limited exercise test between August 1989 and December 1995. The cohort of 3859 individuals free of dementia and vascular disease at baseline was followed for 18 years.

RESULTS: Clinically incident dementia was observed in 123 of the 3859 participants during the mean follow-up period of 18 years. Significant associations were found between the elevated ankle blood pressure at baseline and clinically incident dementia during the follow-up.

Methods currently available to identify risk for conversion do not combine enough sensitivity and specificity, which is even more problematic in low-educated populations. Current guidelines suggest the use of combined markers for dementia to enhance the prediction accuracy of assessment methods. The present study adhered to this proposal and investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the electrophysiological component P300 and standard neuropsychological tests to assess patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MCI recruited from a low-income country. The neuropsychological battery comprised tests of memory, attention, language, praxis, and executive functions. The P300 was recorded using a classical visual odd-ball paradigm. Three variables were found to achieve sensitivity and specificity values above 80% (Immediate and Delayed recall of word list - CERAD - and the latency of P300) for both MCI and AD. When they entered the model together (i.e., combined approach) the sensitivity for MCI increased to 96% and the specificity remained high (80%). Our preliminary findings suggest that the combined use of sensitive neuropsychological tasks and the analysis of the P300 may offer a very useful method for the preclinical assessment of AD, particularly in populations with low socioeconomic and educational levels.

Previously, we demonstrated that after global cerebral ischemia (GCI), 17β-estradiol (E2 or estrogen) suppresses hippocampal elevation of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), a neurodegenerative factor. We, thus, hypothesized that prolonged loss of E2 may lead to dysregulation of neural Dkk1 and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling, which could contribute to an increased risk of neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of short-term (1 week - STED) and long-term E2 deprivation (10 weeks - LTED) via ovariectomy upon basal and E2-regulated Dkk1 levels and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. In STED rats, E2 exerted robust neuroprotection against GCI, suppressed post-ischemic elevation of Dkk1, and enhanced pro-survival Wnt/β-Catenin signaling, effects that were lost in LTED rats. Intriguingly, LTED rats displayed modest basal changes in Dkk1 and survivin expression. Further work showed that c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) mediated GCI-induced changes in Dkk1 and survivin, and JNK inhibition afforded neuroprotection in LTED rats. Finally, we extended our findings to natural aging, as 24-month-old, reproductively senescent female rats also displayed a modest increase in basal Dkk1 in the CA1, which consistently co-localized with the apoptotic marker TUNEL after GCI and coincided with a loss of E2 neuroprotection. As a whole, this study supports the ""critical period hypothesis"" and further suggests that perimenopausal estradiol replacement may prevent neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus by maintaining favorable Wnt/β-Catenin signaling.","2013",,"Steroids",,"other","Animals, FALSE, CA1 Region, Hippocampal, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Estradiol, FALSE, deficiency, Q000172, Female, FALSE, Neurons, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Wnt Signaling Pathway, TRUE, beta Catenin, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In addition to its close association with Type 2 diabetes, which reduces life expectancy in older people, age-related insulin resistance is implicated in pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders for which ageing is a major risk factor. These include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, dementia, frailty and cancer. Accordingly, insulin resistance may be viewed as biomarker of age-related ill health and reduced lifespan. The rapidly rising number of older people, coupled with a high prevalence of insulin resistance resulting from obesity and sedentary lifestyles, presents unprecedented public health and societal challenges. Studies of centenarians have shown that preserved whole-body sensitivity to insulin is associated with longevity. The mechanisms through which insulin action is associated with age-related diseases remain unclear. Changes in body composition, i.e. sarcopenia and excess adiposity, may be more potent than age per se. Moreover, the impact of insulin resistance has been difficult to disentangle from the clustering of vascular risk factors that co-segregate with the insulin resistance-hyperinsulinaemia complex. Potentially modifiable mediators of age-related changes in insulin sensitivity include alterations in adipocytokines, impaired skeletal myocyte mitochondrial function and brown fat activity. The hypothesis that improving or maintaining insulin sensitivity preserves health and extends lifespan merits further evaluation. Practical non-pharmacological interventions directed against age-related insulin resistance remain underdeveloped. Novel metabolically active pharmacological agents with theoretical implications for some age-related disorders are entering clinical trials. However, recent adverse experiences with the thiazolidinediones suggest the need for a cautious approach to the use of insulin sensitizing drugs in older people.

This study was designed to determine if changes in body mass index (BMI) in later life are associated with hazard of incident dementia over a follow-up period of up to eight years.
METHODS: Method followed was a prospective cohort study of 4,181 men aged 65-84 years, resident in Perth, Australia. The exposure of interest was change in BMI measured between 1996-1998 and 2001-2004. The outcome was incident dementia, established using the Western Australia Data Linkage System until 2009. We used Cox regression models to establish crude and adjusted hazard of dementia for change in BMI.
RESULTS: Compared with men with a stable BMI, those with a decrease in BMI >1 kg/m2 had a higher adjusted hazard of dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.32-2.70). The cumulative hazard of dementia over follow-up for changes in BMI was greatest for men with a decrease in BMI >1 kg/m2; this trend was apparent for men in all BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese). A reverse ""J-shaped"" association between BMI change and incident dementia was observed, with the lowest dementia rate being for men whose BMI remained stable.

Among CV diseases, congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a condition where the ability of the left ventricle to eject blood to the circulation is impaired. As a consequence, CHF triggers inflammation and results in reduced cerebral blood flow which are considered among the risk factors for development of AD. However, biochemical alterations in the brain following MI and CHF remain unknown. To address this issue, we investigated microglia activation; levels of BACE1, the key rate-limiting enzyme involved in the pathogenesis of AD; and VEGF levels in the hippocampus and cortex following MI. We created MI by the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in Sprague-Dawley male rats and collected brains either 3 days after MI (AMI) or 21 days after MI (CHF). We investigated microglia activation in AMI and CHF brains by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting using macrophage/microglia marker Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), and observed activated morphology of microglia in the cortex of rats in both AMI and CHF. We also showed the levels of BACE1 were increased in the cortex and hippocampus of CHF rats. To determine whether hypoxia occurs in the CHF brain, we assessed levels of VEGF in the hippocampus and cortex. Western blotting analysis showed up-regulation of VEGF in the hippocampus of CHF brains. These results suggest that neuroinflammation takes place secondary to myocardial infarction.

At the same time, emerging evidence indicates that early disturbances in cognitive processes such as attention, executive function, and working memory are associated with slower gait and gait instability during single- and dual-task testing and that these cognitive disturbances assist in the prediction of future mobility loss, falls, and progression to dementia. This article reviews the importance of the interrelationship between gait and cognition in aging and presents evidence that gait assessments can provide a window into the understanding of cognitive function and dysfunction and fall risk in older people in clinical practice. To this end, the benefits of dual-task gait assessments (e.g., walking while performing an attention-demanding task) as a marker of fall risk are summarized. A potential complementary approach for reducing the risk of falls by improving certain aspects of cognition through nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments is also presented.

To obtain a better understanding of the anti-dementia effect of chotosan (CTS), a Kampo formula, we investigated its effects on cognitive and emotional deficits of type 2 diabetic db/db mice and putative mechanism(s) underlying the effects.
METHODS: Seven-week-old db/db mice received daily administration of CTS (375 - 750 mg/kg, p.o.) and the reference drug tacrine (THA: 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) during an experimental period of 7 weeks. From the age of 9-week-old, the animals underwent the novel object recognition test, the modified Y-maze test, and the water maze test to elucidate cognitive performance and the elevated plus maze test to elucidate anxiety-related behavior. After completing behavioral studies, Western blotting and immunohistochemical studies were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with age-matched non-diabetic control strain (m/m) mice, db/db mice exhibited impaired cognitive performance and an increased level of anxiety. CTS ameliorated cognitive and emotional deficits of db/db mice, whereas THA improved only cognitive performance. The phosphorylated levels of Akt and PKCα in the hippocampus were significantly lower and higher, respectively, in db/db mice than in m/m mice. Expression levels of the hippocampal cholinergic marker proteins and the number of the septal cholinergic neurons were also reduced in db/db mice compared with those in m/m mice. Moreover, the db/db mice had significantly reduced levels of vasculogenesis/angiogenesis factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor type 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B, and PDGF receptor β, in the hippocampus. CTS and THA treatment reversed these neurochemical and histological alterations caused by diabetes.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CTS ameliorates diabetes-induced cognitive deficits by protecting central cholinergic and VEGF/PDGF systems via Akt signaling pathway and that CTS exhibits the anxiolytic effect via neuronal mechanism(s) independent of cholinergic or VEGF/PDGF systems in db/db mice.","2012",,"BMC Complement Altern Med"," To obtain a better understanding of the anti-dementia effect of chotosan ( CTS ) , a Kampo formula , we investigated its effects on cognitive and emotional deficits of type 2 diabetic db / db mice and putative mechanism ( s ) underlying the effects ","other","Animals, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cognition, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Emotions, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Thus, one of the major concerns of modern society is to identify putative biomarkers that serve as a valuable early diagnostic tool to identify a subset of patients with increased risk to develop AD. An ideal biomarker should be present in blood before dementia is clinically confirmed, have high sensitivity and specificity, and be reproducible. Proteomics platforms offer a powerful strategy to reach these goals and recently have been demonstrated to be promising approaches. However, the high variability of technologies and studied populations has led to contrasting results. To increase specificity, we analyzed both protein expression profiles and oxidative modifications (carbonylation) of plasma proteins in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects compared with age-matched controls. Most of the proteins found to have differential levels in MCI and AD confirmed results already obtained in other cohort studies. Interestingly, we applied for the first time in MCI a redox proteomics approach to specifically identify oxidized proteins. Among them, haptoglobin, one of the most abundantly secreted glycoproteins with chaperone function, was found to be either increasingly downregulated or increasingly oxidized in AD and MCI compared with controls. We also demonstrated that in vitro oxidation of haptoglobin affects the formation of amyloid-β fibrils, thus suggesting that oxidized haptoglobin is not able to act as an extracellular chaperone to prevent or slow formation of amyloid-β aggregates. Another chaperone protein, α2-macroglobulin, was found to be selectively oxidized in AD patients compared with controls.

METHODS: The researchers conducted a literature search of observational studies indexed in the PubMed and PsycInfo databases. Selected studies included those with at least one peripheral inflammatory biomarker and its association with risk of all-cause dementia or AD. Random effects models were used to generate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the top versus bottom quantile of inflammatory marker level. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I (2) statistic.
RESULTS: Seven studies were identified, combining for a total 5,717 participants, 746 cases of all-cause dementia and 565 cases of AD. An increased level of C-reactive protein was associated with a 45% increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.91). Similarly, a higher level of interleukin-6 was associated with a 32% increased risk (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.64) of all-cause dementia.

Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of noninvasive testing to correctly identify nonrapid conduction was calculated.
RESULTS: There were 135 EPS. Twenty-four patients (18%) were classified low-risk noninvasively. Two of the 24 (8%) had rapid conduction at baseline EPS. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of low-risk noninvasive testing to predict nonrapid conduction was 22%, 94%, 92%, and 31%, respectively. Sixteen of the 24 had low-risk EST and none had rapid conduction at baseline EPS. The specificity and PPV of low-risk EST were 100%.
CONCLUSION: Loss of preexcitation during noninvasive testing had high specificity and PPV for nonrapid antegrade conduction during baseline EPS. Abrupt loss of preexcitation during EST was a highly reliable noninvasive marker of nonrapid AP conduction at baseline in our pediatric WPW patients.","2012",,"Pacing Clin Electrophysiol"," We aimed to determine the correlation between noninvasive testing and EPS in a pediatric WPW population ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Chi-Square Distribution, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Electrocardiography, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Electrocardiography, Ambulatory, FALSE, Exercise Test, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE, Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Young Adult, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"22961963","Lipoprotein phospholipase A2 and cerebral microbleeds in the Framingham Heart Study.","Romero JR","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) attributable to cerebral amyloid angiopathy generally occur in lobar regions, whereas those attributable to hypertensive vasculopathy are deep. Inflammation may be an underlying mechanism for CMB, with varying associations according to CMB location. Lipoprotein phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA2) is a circulating enzyme marker of vascular inflammation associated with risk of ischemic stroke and dementia. We hypothesized that higher Lp-PLA2 levels would be related to higher prevalence of CMB, with possible regional specificity.
METHODS: Framingham Offspring participants aged 65 years or older with available Lp-PLA2 measures and brain magnetic resonance imaging were included. Logistic regression models were used to relate Lp-PLA2 activity and mass to presence of CMB, adjusted for age, sex, medication use (aspirin, anticoagulants, and statins), systolic blood pressure, APOE, current smoking, and diabetes.
RESULTS: Eight-hundred nineteen participants (mean age, 73 years; 53% women) were included; 106 (13%) had CMB, 82 (10%) were lobar, and 27 (3%) were deep. We did not observe significant associations of CMB and LpPLA2 measures in multivariable adjusted analyses. However, there was a significant interaction between APOE genotype and Lp-PLA2 activity in their relation to presence of deep CMB (P interaction=0.01). Among persons with APOE ε3/ε3, the odds ratio for deep CMB was 0.95 (confidence interval, 0.59-1.53; P=0.83), whereas among those with at least 1 ε2 or ε4 allele, odds ratio was 3.46 (confidence interval, 1.43-8.36; P=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: In our community-based sample of older adults, there was no significant association of Lp-PLA2 with total or lobar CMB.

DESIGN: An 8-yr longitudinal study.
SETTING: The French Three-City Study.
PARTICIPANTS: There were 4,894 patients without dementia recruited from 3 French cities and having a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 24 points at baseline.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Questionnaires were used to evaluate insomnia complaints (poor sleep quality (SQ), difficulty in initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty in maintaining sleep (DMS), early morning awakening (EMA)), EDS, and sleep medication at baseline. Cognitive decline was defined as a 4-point reduction in MMSE score during follow-up at 2, 4, and 8 yr. Logistic regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, physical, and mental health variables, and apolipoprotein E genotype. EDS independently increased the risk of cognitive decline (odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.56), especially for those patients who also developed dementia during the follow-up period (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.00-1.97). The number of insomnia complaints and DMS were negatively associated with MMSE cognitive decline (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60-0.98 for 3-4 complaints, OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.68-0.96, respectively). The 3 other components of insomnia (SQ, DIS, EMA) were not significantly associated with MMSE cognitive decline.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched for studies from first date available to July 2011 using the following search terms: (dementia OR cognitive impairment OR mild cognitive impairment) AND (omega-3 OR omega-6 OR polyunsaturated fatty acid OR docosahexaenoic acid OR DHA OR eicosapentaenoic acid OR EPA). The search was limited to literature in English and to human studies. The references of relevant articles and review articles were searched for citations not indexed in PubMed.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they measured levels of EPA, DHA, AA, total n-3 PUFAs, or total n-6 PUFAs from peripheral blood tissues in subjects with cognitive deficits (dementia or predementia syndrome) and elderly controls and were published in peer-reviewed journals. The search yielded 10 articles including 2,280 subjects.
DATA EXTRACTION: The study design, sample size, PUFA levels for both patients and control subjects, sampling tissue, diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for cognitive deficits, and distribution of mean age and gender of included subjects were extracted for each study.
RESULTS: In a random-effects model, we found that the levels of EPA (effect size [ES] = -0.47, P < .0001), DHA (ES = -0.33, P = .017), and total n-3 PUFAs (ES = -0.46, P = .001) were decreased in patients with dementia. However, the levels of EPA (ES = -0.44, P = .002), but not DHA or other PUFAs, were significantly lower in patients with predementia syndrome.

METHODS: We examined a clinically ascertained FTD cohort (n = 89) and a neuropathologically ascertained cohort of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP) (n = 22) for the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion using a repeat primed PCR assay. All expansion-positive patients were genotyped for rs3849942, a surrogate marker for the chromosome 9p21 risk haplotype previously associated with FTD and ALS.
RESULTS: The C9ORF72 repeat expansion was detected in 10% of patients in the clinically diagnosed cohort, rising to 29% in those with a positive family history of early-onset dementia or ALS. The prevalence of psychotic features was significantly higher in expansion-positive cases (56% vs 14%). In the pathology cohort, 41% of TDP-43-positive cases harbored the repeat expansion, and all exhibited type B pathology. One of the 17 expansion-positive probands was homozygous for the ""nonrisk"" G allele of rs3849942.

Serum anticholinergic activity (SAA) was proposed as a disease marker as it may reflect delirium's important pathogenetic mechanism, cholinergic deficiency. We assessed the association of serum anticholinergic activity with delirium and its risk factors in a longitudinal study on elderly hip fracture patients.
METHOD: Consecutive elderly patients admitted for hip fracture surgery (n = 142) were assessed longitudinally for delirium, risk factors, and serum markers (IL-6, cortisol, and SAA). Using a sophisticated statistical design, we evaluated the association between SAA and delirium in general and with adjustments, but also the temporal course, including the events fracture, surgery, and potential delirium, individual confounders, and a propensity score.
RESULTS: Among elderly hip fracture patients 51% developed delirium, these showed more risk factors (p < 0.001), and complications (p < 0.05). Uncontrolled SAA levels (463 samples) were significantly higher in the delirium group (4.2 vs. 3.4 pmol/ml) and increased with delirium onset, but risk factors absorbed the effect. Using mixed-modeling we found a significant increase in SAA concentration (7.6% (95%CI 5.0-10.2, p < 0.001)) per day, which was modified by surgery and delirium, but this effect was confounded by cognitive impairment and IL-6 values. Confounder control by propensity scores resulted in a disappearance of delirium-induced SAA increase.
CONCLUSIONS: Delirium-predisposing factors are closely associated with changes in the temporal profile of serum anticholinergic activity and thus neutralize the previously documented association between higher SAA levels and delirium.

METHODS: We studied 193 cognitively normal individuals, of whom 173 remained cognitively stable (CN-stable) and 20 were diagnosed with aMCI (CN-aMCI converter) 2 years later. Structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging were acquired at baseline to assess gray matter atrophy and microstructural white matter changes, respectively.
RESULTS: At baseline, compared with CN-stable, CN-aMCI converters had substantial reductions in white matter integrity in the precuneus, parahippocampal cingulum, parahippocampal gyrus white matter, and fornix. Other diffuse white matter changes were observed in the frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions, whereas gray matter structures were relatively intact. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the precuneus were found to be a predictor of conversion from cognitively normal to aMCI. In addition, the FA values of the left parahippocampal gyrus white matter were predictive of subsequent episodic memory decline.

DESIGN: We studied available stored leukocyte DNA from a community-based study of aging using realtime polymerase chain reaction analysis to determine mean TL in our modification of a method measuring the ratio of telomere sequence to single-copy gene sequence.
SETTING: A multiethnic community-based study of aging and dementia.
PARTICIPANTS: One thousand nine hundred eighty-three subjects 65 years or older. Mean (SD) age at blood draw was 78.3 (6.9) years; at death, 86.0 (7.4) years. Median follow-up for mortality was 9.3 years; 190 (9.6%) developed incident dementia.
RESULTS: The TL was inversely related to age and shorter in men than women. Persons dying during follow-up had a shorter TL compared with survivors (mean [SD], 6218 [819] vs 6491 [881] base pairs [bp] [P.001]), even after adjustment for age, sex, education, and apolipoprotein E genotype. Individuals who developed dementia had significantly shorter TL (mean [SD], 6131 [798] bp for prevalent cases and 6315 [817] bp for incident cases) compared with those remaining dementia-free (6431 [864] bp). Cox-regression analyses showed that shorter TL was a risk for earlier onset of dementia (P=.05), but stratified analyses for sex showed that this association of age at onset of dementia with shorter TL was significant in women only.

The development of validated biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is essential to improve diagnosis and accelerate the development of new therapies. Biochemical and neuroimaging markers could facilitate diagnosis, predict AD progression from a pre-AD state of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and be used to monitor efficacies of disease-modifying therapies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau have diagnostic values in AD. Measurements of the above CSF markers in combination are useful in predicting the risk of progression from MCI to AD. New potential biomarkers are emerging, and CSF or plasma marker profiles may eventually become part of the clinician's toolkit for accurate AD diagnosis and management.

Likewise there is little information about the interaction between proteins that produce PD and those implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we have investigated the interactions between parkin protein and the amyloid-β (Aβ)1-42 peptide. We examined the effects of oligomeric Aβ1-42 peptide on the survival, differentiation, and signaling pathways in cortical cultures from wild type (WT) and parkin null (PK-KO) mice. We discovered that PK-KO cells were more resistant than WT to Aβ1-42. This peptide induced neuronal cell death, astrogliosis, microglial proliferation, and increased total and hyperphosphorylated tau and levels of chaperones HSP-70 and CHIP in WT, but not in Aβ-treated PK-KO cultures. Aβ1-42 decreased proteasome activities in WT and PK-KO cultures, but the ubiquitination of proteins only increased in WT cultures. Aβ1-42 induced a short activation of ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, implicated in cell survival, in PK-KO-treated cells, and a shift in the autophagy marker LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. In addition, the percentage of cells immunoreactive to both HSC70 and LAMP-2A increased in PK-KO cultures versus WT and furthermore in PK-KO cultures treated with Aβ1-42. Pre-treatment with inhibitors of glutathione synthesis or autophagy reverted the resistance to Aβ1-42 of the PK-KO cultures. In conclusion, the loss of parkin protein triggers the compensatory mechanisms of cell protection against Aβ1-42.

Leptin, an adipose tissue hormone, is correlated with adiposity measures and may contribute to a better etiological understanding of the relationship between high adiposity and dementia. We explored the relationship between serum leptin in mid-life and dementia, which is a late-life outcome.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study, the Prospective Population Study of Women, in Gothenburg, Sweden, includes a representative sample of 1462 women followed from mid-life ages of 38 to 60 years to late-life ages of 70 to 92 years. Women were examined in 1968, 1974, 1980, 1992, and 2000 using neuropsychiatric, anthropometric, clinical, and other measurements. Serum leptin was measured on samples collected at the 1968 baseline examination, after storage at -20°C for 29 years. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated incident dementia risk by baseline leptin. Logistic regression models related leptin levels to dementia among surviving participants 32 years later. All models were adjusted for multiple potential confounders.
RESULTS: Mid-life leptin was not related to dementia risk using Cox or logistic regression models. This was observed despite positive baseline correlations between leptin and adiposity measures, and given our previous report of high mid-life waist-to-hip ratio being related to a twofold higher dementia risk.

Because the retina and brain share embryological, anatomical and physiological similarities, studies of retinal blood vessels may prove to be useful as a surrogate marker for cerebrovascular disease. In epidemiological studies abnormal retinal arteriovenous ratios (AVRs) predict the risk of stroke and vascular dementia. However, the association between retinal vasoreactivity, cerebral small vessel ischemic disease, and cerebral blood vessel function remains unknown.
STUDY GOALS: To examine (1) the association between cerebral ischemic white matter disease (WMD) and retinal microvessel behavior and (2) the relationship between retinal blood vessel reactivity and measures of cerebrovascular function.
METHODS: Cohort study of 12 patients with ischemic WMD and 14 healthy controls. Retinal vasoreactivity was measured following high frequency flicker light stimulation. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) vasoreactivity was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD). Magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) were reviewed for evidence of ischemic WMD.
RESULTS: Patients with ischemic WMD had attenuated retinal venous (2.2% ± 0.27 SD, vs. controls 6% ± 0.7 SD, p=0.002, CI 95%) and arterial (1.9% ± 0.8 SD, vs. controls 4.9% ± 0.8 SD, p=0.004, CI 95%) vasoreactivity compared to controls. An attenuated retinal venous light flicker response was associated with a significant decrease of MCA vasoreactivity (r=0.45, p=0.05, CI 95%). Decreased AVRs, an indicator for altered retinal vessel architecture in patients with cerebral chronic ischemic WMD, were also significantly correlated with dysfunction of cerebral vasoreactivity (r=0.69, p=0.001, CI 95%).

Fifty-five older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment (34 with MCI and 21 with AD) were assessed at baseline and after 4 years. MCI patients were re-classified according to the conversion status upon follow-up: 25 individuals retained the diagnostic status of MCI and were considered as stable cases (MCI-MCI); conversely, in nine cases the diagnosis of dementia due to AD was ascertained. The APP ratio (APPr) was determined by the Western blot method in samples of platelets collected at baseline. We found a significant reduction of APPr in MCI patients who converted to dementia upon follow-up. These individuals had baseline APPr values similar to those of demented AD patients. The overall accuracy of APPr to identify subjects with MCI who will progress to AD was 0.74 ± 0.10, p = 0.05. The cut-off of 1.12 yielded a sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity of 75 %. Platelet APPr may be a surrogate marker of the disease process in AD, with potential implications for the assessment of abnormalities in the APP metabolism in patients with and at risk for dementia. However, diagnostic accuracy was relatively low. Therefore, studies in larger samples are needed to determine whether APPr may warrant its use as a biomarker to support the early diagnosis of AD.","2012",,"J Neural Transm (Vienna)"," In the present study , we sought to determine if baseline APP ratio predicts the conversion from MCI to AD dementia after 4 years of longitudinal assessment ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Blood Platelets, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Early Diagnosis, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE, Severity of Illness Index, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of PD patients with and without SFOB.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive PD patients, who completed an REM sleep behavior disorder screening questionnaire (RBDSQ), questionnaires to assess for RBD clinical mimickers and questions about SFOB and resulting injuries. Determination of high risk for RBD was based on an RBDSQ score of 5 or greater.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients reported history of SFOB (26%). Visual hallucinations, sleep-related injury, quetiapine and amantadine use were more common in those patients reporting SFOB. Twenty-two patients (44%) fulfilled criteria for high risk for RBD, 12 of which (55%) reported SFOB. Five patients reported injuries related to SFOB. SFOB patients had higher RBDSQ scores than non-SFOB patients (8.2±3.0 vs. 3.3±2.0, p<0.01). For every one unit increase in RBDSQ score, the likelihood of SFOB increased two-fold (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.2, p<0.003).

Emergency transfers to a general hospital are a reasonable marker of significant medical deterioration, but have not been assessed systematically.
OBJECTIVE: To use clinical data available at the time of psychiatric admission to identify risk factors for transfers to a general hospital.
METHOD: Retrospective review of the hospital course of 1000 adults consecutively admitted for an average of 19.1 ± 21.3 days to a single free-standing psychiatric hospital in 2010.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-four patients (14.4%) were transferred to a general hospital. Transferred and not-transferred groups differed significantly with regard to age, presence of dementia, number of comorbid medical disorder, history of arterial hypertension, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, glucose, calcium, hemoglobin, and hematocrit (P < .001). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, blood urea nitrogen (odds ratio [OR], 63.2), hemoglobin (OR, 35.3), albumin (OR, 7.3) and age (OR, 5.73) were independently associated with transfers. Acute medical deteriorations occurred in 46.2% of patients with azotemia (BUN >24 mg/dL), 32.7% of those with anemia (Hb <12 g/L), 37.5 % of those with hypoalbuminemia (albumin <3.7 g/dL), and 37.4% of patients 65 and older.

There is compelling evidence that changes of postural stability occur at very early clinical stages of Parkinson's disease, making it tempting to speculate that changes in sway performance may even occur at a prodromal stage, and may have the potential to serve as a prodromal marker for the disease.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Balance performance was tested in 20 individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, 12 Parkinson's disease patients and 14 controls using a cross-sectional approach. All individuals were 50 years or older. Investigated groups were similar with respect to age, gender, and height. An accelerometer at the centre of mass at the lower spine quantified sway during quiet semitandem stance with eyes open and closed, as well as with and without foam. With increasing task difficulty, individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease showed an increased variability of trunk acceleration and a decrease of smoothness of sway, compared to both other groups. These differences reached significance in the most challenging condition, i.e. the eyes closed with foam condition.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease have subtle signs of a balance deficit under most challenging conditions. This preliminary finding should motivate further studies on sway performance in individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, to evaluate the potential of this symptom to serve as a biological marker for prodromal Parkinson's disease.","2012",,"PLoS One",,"other","Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Risk Factors, FALSE, Torso, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

To what extent vascular risk factors and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) affect hippocampal volume (HV) in asymptomatic elderly subjects and thus may impact such a predictive capacity is controversial.
METHODS: We analysed 287 participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (mean age 66.6 ± 6.6 years) with a Mini Mental State Examination score ≥27 who were free of neuropsychiatric disease and had undergone MRI including coronal T(1)-weighted sequences allowing for semi-automatic assessment of HV. Global brain volume (BV) was measured using SIENAX. WMH were rated according to the Fazekas scale and segmented to obtain WMH volumes.
RESULTS: Higher age was associated with lower absolute and normalized HV, a lower BV and higher WMH volume. None of the vascular risk factors had an impact on HV except for high-density lipoprotein. This effect disappeared after normalization of HV. WMH severity and volume did not affect HV either.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate HV loss in parallel with the whole brain and suggest no specific vulnerability towards vascular risk factors or age-related WMH in a cognitively intact normal elderly population.

Changes in global cognition and 4 specific neuropsychological domains (episodic memory, semantic memory, spatial abilities, and executive function) were examined as outcomes. Separate random effects models tested the effect of ID on longitudinal change in outcomes, adjusted for age and education.
RESULTS: Lower ID was associated with greater subsequent decline in global cognition, semantic memory, episodic memory, and spatial abilities. When analysis was restricted to only participants without dementia at the time ID was collected, results were similar.
DISCUSSION: Linguistic ability in young adulthood, as measured by ID, has been previously proposed as an index of neurocognitive development and/or cognitive reserve.

Until now, diagnosis is based on clinical and neuropsychological examinations, since so far there is no laboratory marker. In this study we aimed to find a neurochemical marker which would allow a risk assessment for the development of a dementia in PD patients. For this purpose, we adopted a gel-free proteomic approach (iTRAQ-method) to identify biomarker-candidates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with PD, PDD and non-demented controls (NDC). Validation of these candidates was then carried out by multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) optimised for CSF. Using the iTRAQ-approach, we were able to identify 16 differentially regulated proteins. Fourteen out of these 16 proteins could then be followed-up simultaneously in our optimised MRM-measurement protocol. However only Tyrosine-kinase-non-receptor-type 13 and Netrin-G1 differed significantly between PDD and NDC cohorts. In addition, a significant difference was found for Golgin-160 and Apolipoprotein B-100 between PD and NDC. Apart from possible pathophysiological considerations, we propose that Tyrosine-kinase non-receptor-type 13 and Netrin G1 are biomarker candidates for the development of a Parkinson's disease dementia. Furthermore we suggest that iTRAQ and MRM are valuable tools for the discovery of biomarker in cerebrospinal fluid.

AIM: To analyse how polymorphism in genes regulating Mn metabolism and toxicity can modify neurophysiological effects of Mn exposure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elderly (N=255) and adolescents (N=311) from Northern Italy were examined for neuromotor and olfactory functions. Exposure to Mn was assessed in blood and urine by atomic absorption spectroscopy and in soil by a portable instrument based on X-Ray fluorescence technology. Polymorphisms in the Parkinson-related gene ATPase type 13A2 (ATP13A2, also called PARK9: rs3738815, rs2076602, rs4920608, rs2871776 and rs2076600), and in the secretory pathway Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) ATPase isoform 1 gene (SPCA1: rs218498, rs3773814 and rs2669858) were analysed by TaqMan probes.
RESULTS: For both adolescents and elderly, negative correlations between Mn in soil and motor coordination (R(s)=-0.20, p<0.001; R(s)=-0.13, p=0.05, respectively) were demonstrated. Also among adolescents, negative correlations were seen between Mn in soil with odor identification (R(s)=-0.17, p<0.01). No associations were seen for Mn in blood or urine. ATP13A2 polymorphisms rs4920608 and rs2871776 significantly modified the effects of Mn exposure on impaired motor coordination in elderly (p for interaction=0.029, p=0.041, respectively), also after adjustments for age and gender.

Some of these findings have been confirmed in several, but not all, subsequent independent cohort studies. A three-fold risk for the development of HIV-associated dementia was reported in individuals possessing a CCL3L1 copy number below the ethnic group median combined with a detrimental CCR5 genotype. With the availability of antiretroviral therapy since 1996, there has been a significant decline in HIV-associated dementia, and milder forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND) are now most prevalent. Moreover, patients are living longer with HIV-1 infection and it is recognized that aging may be a contributory factor to the development of cognitive disorder. Thus, the need for biomarkers that can be used in clinical practice to identify and provide optimal treatment for those at increased risk for HAND is great. HAND affects 20%-30% of HIV-infected individuals, and several genetic loci which have been shown to confer susceptibility to HIV infection may also modulate the development of neurocognitive disorder. The aim of this study was to determine whether CCL3L1 chemokine gene copy number in self-defined ethnic groups could differentiate HIV-infected individuals with and without HAND.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal swabs or peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from HIV-infected patients with or without a diagnoses of neurocognitive dysfunction in the Northeast AIDS Dementia Cohort and National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium. To maintain a uniform standard, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction design similar to previous studies using Taqman probes and fixed input DNA between 2 ng and 10 ng was used to determine a CCL3L1 copy number. Standard curves with two-fold dilutions from 25 ng to 1.56 ng were generated.

We examined the modifications in gene expression and protein levels of apoE and its key receptors, the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the LDLR-related protein (LRP), as well as the reactive astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in different brain structures throughout the degenerative and reactive regenerative period. In the striatum, upregulations of GFAP, apoE and LRP mRNAs at 1 day post-treatment were associated with marked decreases in dopamine (DA) levels, loss in tyrosine hydroxylase protein content, as well as to a compensatory increase in dopaminergic metabolism. Subsequent return to near control levels coincided with indications of reinnervation in the striatum: all consistent with a role of apoE during the degenerative process and regenerative period. We also found that this cascade was activated in the hippocampus and more so than in the striatum, with a particular contribution of LDLR expression. The hippocampal activation did not correlate with substantial neurochemical reductions but appears to reflect local subtle alteration of DA metabolism and the regulation of plasticity-related event in this structure. This study provides first evidence of an activation of the apoE/apoE receptors cascade in a mouse model of PD, specifically in the MPTP-induced deafferentation of the striatum. Results are also quite consistent with the postulated role of apoE in brain repair but, raise the issue of possible lesion- and region-specific alterations in gene expression.","2012",,"Exp Neurol",,"other","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Biogenic Monoamines, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Brain, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Electrochemical Techniques, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, MPTP Poisoning, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Male, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Neurotoxins, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, RNA, Messenger, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Receptors, LDL, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Signal Transduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Time Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"22120153","Synuclein accumulation is associated with cell-specific neuronal death after spinal cord injury.","Busch DJ","Spinal cord injury axotomizes neurons and induces many of them to die, whereas others survive. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that lead to neuronal death after injury as a first step toward developing better strategies for increasing neuronal survival and functional recovery. However, the intrinsic molecular pathways that govern whether an injured neuron lives or dies remain surprisingly unclear. To address this question, we took advantage of the large size of giant reticulospinal (RS) neurons in the brain of the lamprey, Petromyzon marinus. We report that axotomy of giant RS neurons induces a select subset of them to accumulate high levels of synuclein, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein whose abnormal accumulation is linked to Parkinson's disease. Injury-induced synuclein accumulation occurred only in neurons that were classified as ""poor survivors"" by both histological and Fluoro-Jade C staining. In contrast, post-injury synuclein immunofluorescence remained at control levels in neurons that were identified as ""good survivors."" Synuclein accumulation appeared in the form of aggregated intracellular inclusions. Cells that accumulated synuclein also exhibited more ubiquitin-containing inclusions, similar to what occurs during disease states. When synuclein levels and cell vitality were measured in the same neurons, it became clear that synuclein accumulation preceded and strongly correlated with subsequent neuronal death. Thus, synuclein accumulation is identified as a marker and potential risk factor for forthcoming neuronal death after axotomy, expanding its implications beyond the neurodegenerative diseases.","2012",,"J Comp Neurol",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Blotting, Western, FALSE, Cell Death, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Fluorescent Antibody Technique, FALSE, In Situ Hybridization, FALSE, Inclusion Bodies, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Lampreys, FALSE, Microscopy, Confocal, FALSE, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, FALSE, Spinal Cord Injuries, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Synucleins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Ubiquitin, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Several independent GWAS and metanalysis studies have shown a genome-wide significant association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the α-synuclein (SNCA) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) regions. Here we investigated the role of SNCA and MAPT as PD susceptibility genes in a large Italian population of 904 patients and 891 controls. An evaluation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in association with PD was also attempted.
METHODS: The SNCA Rep1 microsatellite was genotyped by a fluorescent PCR assay, whereas the SNPlex genotyping system was used to genotype 12 additional markers across the SNCA gene, and 2 SNPs tagging the risk MAPT H1 haplotype.
RESULTS: Single-marker analysis demonstrated nominal evidence of association for: i) the 261-bp-long allele of Rep1; ii) 7 SNPs in the SNCA region (top SNP: rs356186, P = 3.08 × 10(-04), intron 4); iii) both SNPs identifying the MAPT H1 haplotype (P = 4.63 × 10(-04) and P = 4.23 × 10(-04) for rs1800547 and rs9468, respectively).

An apprehension that WF may accelerate the onset of PD also exists. Identifying reliable biomarkers of exposure and neurotoxicity are therefore critical for biomonitoring and neurological risk characterization of WF exposure. Manganese (Mn) in welding consumables is considered the causative factor for the neurological deficits seen in welders. Hence, we sought to determine if Mn accumulation in blood or nail clippings can be a marker for adverse exposure and neurotoxicity. To model this, rats were exposed by intratracheal instillation to dissolved or suspended fume components collected from gas metal arc-mild steel (GMA-MS) or manual metal arc-hard surfacing (MMA-HS) welding. Trace element analysis revealed selective Mn accumulation in dopaminergic brain areas, striatum (STR) and midbrain (MB), following exposure to the two fumes. This caused dopaminergic abnormality as evidenced by loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (Th; 25-32% decrease) and Parkinson disease (autosomal recessive, early onset) 7 (Park7; 25-46% decrease) proteins. While blood Mn was not detectable, Mn levels in nails strongly correlated with the pattern of Mn accumulation in the striatum (R(2)=0.9386) and midbrain (R(2)=0.9332). Exposure to manganese chloride (MnCl(2)) caused similar Mn accumulation in STR, MB and nail. Our findings suggest that nail Mn has the potential to be a sensitive and reliable biomarker for long-term Mn exposure and associated neurotoxicity. The non-invasive means by which nail clippings can be collected, stored, and transported with relative ease, make it an attractive surrogate for biomonitoring WF exposures in occupational settings.","2012",,"Toxicology"," Hence , we sought to determine if Mn accumulation in blood or nail clippings can be a marker for adverse exposure and neurotoxicity ","other","Air Pollutants, Occupational, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Animals, FALSE, Atmosphere Exposure Chambers, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Blotting, Western, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Dopamine, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Environmental Monitoring, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Hoof and Claw, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Humans, FALSE, Inhalation Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Lung, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Male, FALSE, Manganese, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Manganese Poisoning, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Metals, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Nails, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Occupational Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Tissue Distribution, FALSE, Welding, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Although few personal characteristics associated with developing ALS are known, identification of those at risk is essential to any vision of early intervention. There is persistent anecdotal observation that those with ALS are premorbidly physically 'fitter', although such observations are susceptible to bias. Hospital admission for coronary heart disease (CHD) might serve as an objective marker of reduced cardiovascular fitness.
METHODS: A record linkage study of two large databases of hospital admissions, the Oxford Record Linkage Study (ORLS) and an English national record linkage dataset of Hospital Episode Statistics was undertaken. The ratio of the rate of ALS in people without a record of CHD to that in those with a record of CHD was calculated, factoring out premature death in both cohorts. Similar analysis for Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) was undertaken.
RESULTS: In the English population, the rate ratio for ALS in the non-CHD cohort, compared with the CHD cohort, was 1.14 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.22); for PD it was 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.98); and for MS 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.04). The ORLS data yielded similar findings.

Microstructural alterations within this region have been quantified in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a relatively novel MRI-based technique for mapping diffusion properties of water. Existing evidence indicates that DTI-derived mean diffusivity (MD) of the anterior hippocampus is more predictive than ordinary volumetric indices of the degree of episodic memory impairment in patients with early AD. Thus, altered MD of the (anterior) hippocampus might be highly indicative of hippocampal dysfunction, thereby potentially qualifying this measure as a candidate marker for monitoring progression of AD. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this concept. DTI-based assessment of hippocampal microstructure might be also of value for early AD diagnosis and for predicting the course of cognitive decline in subjects at risk for Alzheimer's dementia. Mean diffusivity as microstructural and volume as macrostructural index of hippocampal integrity seem to reflect different, albeit overlapping, aspects of the neurodegenerative process.

Therefore, mechanisms that enhance their susceptibility to injury bear important implications for disease pathogenesis. We have previously shown that chronic dichlorvos exposure caused nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and significant behavioral impairments. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between microglial activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration to examine the possibility that neuroinflammation may induce dopaminergic neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal system. Chronic dichlorvos exposure causes microglial activation including induction of NADPH oxidase and a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in rat. Microglial marker expression was increased at transcription as well as translational levels in the substantia nigra (SN) and corpus striatum (CS) of rats exposed to dichlorvos. Activated microglia were seen in SN and CS of dichlorvos-treated animals but were rarely observed in controls. Immunostaining revealed lesser number of TH-positive neurons and higher number of microglia in SN and CS regions after dichlorvos treatment. The mRNA and protein levels of the NADPH oxidase main subunit gp91(phox) were significantly increased after dichlorvos administration. Dichlorvos exposure also leads to increased level of microglial noxious mediators such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in ventral midbrain and CS at transcription as well as translational levels.

DESIGN: Literature searches were performed using Medline up to February 2010. Individual articles were then examined for additional references not revealed by automated searches. This yielded 79 articles whose abstracts were read by the authors to select key papers.
RESULTS: Amyloid deposition assessed using PIB-PET is significantly elevated in AD and DLB compared to controls and those with FTD. In MCI, uptake is often intermediate between AD and normal ageing, and excessive amyloid burden in non-demented individuals with MCI are likely to represent high-risk cases. Amyloid deposition appears to be an early event, and as dementia progresses clinical decline seems to be more associated with neurodegeneration than amyloid burden.
CONCLUSIONS: PIB-PET imaging is a sensitive and specific marker for underlying Aβ amyloid deposition and represents an important investigative tool for examining the relationship between amyloid burden, clinical symptoms and structural and functional changes in dementia. Amyloid imaging may also be useful for selecting patients for anti-amyloid therapies. However, studies have identified PIB-positive cases in otherwise healthy older individuals (10-30%), limiting diagnostic specificity.

We used genome-wide genotype data and lifetime caffeinated-coffee-consumption data on 1,458 persons with PD and 931 without PD from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC), and we performed a genome-wide association and interaction study (GWAIS), testing each SNP's main-effect plus its interaction with coffee, adjusting for sex, age, and two principal components. We then stratified subjects as heavy or light coffee-drinkers and performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) in each group. We replicated the most significant SNP. Finally, we imputed the NGRC dataset, increasing genomic coverage to examine the region of interest in detail. The primary analyses (GWAIS, GWAS, Replication) were performed using genotyped data. In GWAIS, the most significant signal came from rs4998386 and the neighboring SNPs in GRIN2A. GRIN2A encodes an NMDA-glutamate-receptor subunit and regulates excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. Achieving P(2df) = 10(-6), GRIN2A surpassed all known PD susceptibility genes in significance in the GWAIS. In stratified GWAS, the GRIN2A signal was present in heavy coffee-drinkers (OR = 0.43; P = 6×10(-7)) but not in light coffee-drinkers. The a priori Replication hypothesis that ""Among heavy coffee-drinkers, rs4998386_T carriers have lower PD risk than rs4998386_CC carriers"" was confirmed: OR(Replication) = 0.59, P(Replication) = 10(-3); OR(Pooled) = 0.51, P(Pooled) = 7×10(-8). Compared to light coffee-drinkers with rs4998386_CC genotype, heavy coffee-drinkers with rs4998386_CC genotype had 18% lower risk (P = 3×10(-3)), whereas heavy coffee-drinkers with rs4998386_TC genotype had 59% lower risk (P = 6×10(-13)). Imputation revealed a block of SNPs that achieved P(2df)<5×10(-8) in GWAIS, and OR = 0.41, P = 3×10(-8) in heavy coffee-drinkers. This study is proof of concept that inclusion of environmental factors can help identify genes that are missed in GWAS. Both adenosine antagonists (caffeine-like) and glutamate antagonists (GRIN2A-related) are being tested in clinical trials for treatment of PD. GRIN2A may be a useful pharmacogenetic marker for subdividing individuals in clinical trials to determine which medications might work best for which patients.","2011",,"PLoS Genet","Our aim was to identify genes that influence the inverse association of coffee with the risk of developing Parkinson's disease ( PD ) ","other","Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Coffee, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Gene-Environment Interaction, TRUE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Genome, Human, FALSE, Genome-Wide Association Study, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Risk Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The brain is an early target of organ damage due to high blood pressure, which is the major modifiable risk factor for stroke and small vessel disease. Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the number one cause of disability worldwide and over 80% of strokes occur in the elderly. Preclinical hypertensive lesions in most target organs are clearly identified: left ventricular hypertrophy for the heart, microalbuminuria for the kidney, fundus abnormalities for the eye, and intima-media thickness and pulse wave velocity for the vessels. However, early hypertensive brain damage is not fully studied due to difficulties in access and the expense of techniques. After age, hypertension is the most-important risk factor for cerebral white matter lesions, which are an important prognostic factor for stroke, cognitive impairment, dementia, and death. Studies have shown an association between white matter lesions and a number of extracranial systems affected by high BP and also suggest that correct antihypertensive treatment could slow white matter lesions progression.

METHODS: A total of 1,352 participants without dementia from the prospective Framingham Offspring Cohort Study were examined. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were implemented to study the association of midlife vascular risk factor exposure with longitudinal change in white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), total brain volume (TBV), temporal horn volume, logical memory delayed recall, visual reproductions delayed-recall (VR-d), and Trail-Making Test B-A (TrB-A) performance a decade later.
RESULTS: Hypertension in midlife was associated with accelerated WMHV progression (p < 0.001) and worsening executive function (TrB-A score; p = 0.012). Midlife diabetes and smoking were associated with a more rapid increase in temporal horn volume, a surrogate marker of accelerated hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.017 and p = 0.008, respectively). Midlife smoking also predicted a more marked decrease in total brain volume (p = 0.025) and increased risk of extensive change in WMHV (odds ratio = 1.58 [95%confidence interval 1.07-2.33], p = 0.021). Obesity in midlife was associated with an increased risk of being in the top quartile of change in executive function (1.39 [1.02-1.88], p = 0.035) and increasing waist-to-hip ratio was associated with marked decline in TBV (10.81 [1.44-81.01], p = 0.021). Longitudinal changes in brain structure were significantly correlated with decline in memory and executive function.

A growing body of evidence suggests low vitamin D levels also play a role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of non-skeletal, age-associated diseases including cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and stroke. Low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a stable marker of vitamin D status, are also associated with increased odds of prevalent cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease and all-cause dementia in a number of studies, raising the possibility that vitamin D plays a role in the aetiology of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. To date, the majority of human studies reporting associations between vitamin D and cognition or dementia have been cross-sectional or case-control designs that do not permit us to exclude the possibility that such associations are a result of disease progression rather than being causal. Animal and in vitro experiments have identified a number of neuroprotective mechanisms that might link vitamin D status to cognitive dysfunction and dementia, including vasoprotection and amyloid phagocytosis and clearance, but the clinical relevance of these mechanisms in humans is not currently clear. Two recent, large, prospective studies go some way to establish the temporal relationship with cognitive decline. The relative risk of cognitive decline was 60% higher (relative risk = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2, 2.0) in elderly Italian adults with severely deficient 25(OH)D levels (<25 nmol/L) when compared with those with sufficient levels (≥75 nmol/L). Similarly, the odds of cognitive decline were 41% higher (odds ratio = 1.4, 95% CI 0.9, 2.2) when elderly US men in the lowest quartile (≤49.7 nmol/L) were compared with those in the highest quartile (≥74.4 nmol/L). To our knowledge, no prospective studies have examined the association between 25(OH)D levels and incident dementia or neuroimaging abnormalities. The possible therapeutic benefits of vitamin D have attracted considerable interest as over 1 billion people worldwide are thought to have insufficient 25(OH)D levels and these levels can be increased using inexpensive and well tolerated dietary supplements. However, no large randomized controlled trials have yet examined the effect of vitamin D supplements on cognitive decline or incident dementia.

,"21778438","Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia: a statement for healthcare professionals from the american heart association/american stroke association.","Gorelick PB","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This scientific statement provides an overview of the evidence on vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia of later life are common. Definitions of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), neuropathology, basic science and pathophysiological aspects, role of neuroimaging and vascular and other associated risk factors, and potential opportunities for prevention and treatment are reviewed. This statement serves as an overall guide for practitioners to gain a better understanding of VCI and dementia, prevention, and treatment.
METHODS: Writing group members were nominated by the writing group co-chairs on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee, the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, and the Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writing group used systematic literature reviews (primarily covering publications from 1990 to May 1, 2010), previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and, when appropriate, formulate recommendations using standard American Heart Association criteria. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. After peer review by the American Heart Association, as well as review by the Stroke Council leadership, Council on Epidemiology and Prevention Council, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, the statement was approved by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.
RESULTS: The construct of VCI has been introduced to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury-not solely stroke-ranging from mild cognitive impairment through fully developed dementia. Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow are likely to be important components of the pathophysiological processes underlying VCI. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is emerging as an important marker of risk for Alzheimer disease, microinfarction, microhemorrhage and macrohemorrhage of the brain, and VCI. The neuropathology of cognitive impairment in later life is often a mixture of Alzheimer disease and microvascular brain damage, which may overlap and synergize to heighten the risk of cognitive impairment. In this regard, magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging techniques play an important role in the definition and detection of VCI and provide evidence that subcortical forms of VCI with white matter hyperintensities and small deep infarcts are common. In many cases, risk markers for VCI are the same as traditional risk factors for stroke. These risks may include but are not limited to atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, these same vascular risk factors may be risk markers for Alzheimer disease. Carotid intimal-medial thickness and arterial stiffness are emerging as markers of arterial aging and may serve as risk markers for VCI. Currently, no specific treatments for VCI have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, detection and control of the traditional risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease may be effective in the prevention of VCI, even in older people.
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are important. Understanding of VCI has evolved substantially in recent years, based on preclinical, neuropathologic, neuroimaging, physiological, and epidemiological studies. Transdisciplinary, translational, and transactional approaches are recommended to further our understanding of this entity and to better characterize its neuropsychological profile. There is a need for prospective, quantitative, clinical-pathological-neuroimaging studies to improve knowledge of the pathological basis of neuroimaging change and the complex interplay between vascular and Alzheimer disease pathologies in the evolution of clinical VCI and Alzheimer disease. Long-term vascular risk marker interventional studies beginning as early as midlife may be required to prevent or postpone the onset of VCI and Alzheimer disease. Studies of intensive reduction of vascular risk factors in high-risk groups are another important avenue of research.","2011",,"Stroke","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : This scientific statement provides an overview of the evidence on vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia "," review","Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, American Heart Association, FALSE, Cerebral Angiography, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Dementia, Vascular, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mental Disorders, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, Risk Factors, FALSE, United States, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Our objective was to analyze the radiographic features of PDB associated with VCP mutations since there is a dearth of literature on the PDB component of VCP disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographic bone surveys were examined in 23 individuals with VCP mutation and compared with their unaffected relatives. Laboratory testing relevant for VCP disease was performed in all individuals.
RESULTS: Of the 17 affected individuals with clinical manifestations of VCP disease, 16 of whom had myopathy, radiographic analysis revealed classic PDB in 11 individuals (65%). The mean age of diagnosis for myopathy was 43.8 years and for PDB was 38.1 years of age. Radiological evidence of PDB was seen in one individual (16%) amongst six clinically asymptomatic VCP mutation carriers. Alkaline phosphatase was a useful marker for diagnosing PDB in VCP disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic findings of classic PDB are seen in 52% of individuals carrying VCP mutations at a significantly younger age than conventional PDB.

As all three disorders represent complex diseases with evidence of inflammation, we hypothesized a role for LRRK2 in immune cell functions. Here, we report that full-length Lrrk2 is a relatively common constituent of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) including affinity isolated, CD14(+) monocytes, CD19(+) B cells, and CD4(+) as well as CD8(+) T cells. Up to 26% of PBMC from healthy donors and up to 43% of CD14(+) monocytes were stained by anti-Lrrk2 antibodies using cell sorting. PBMC lysates contained full-length (>260 kDa) and higher molecular weight Lrrk2 species. The expression of LRRK2 in circulating leukocytes was confirmed by microscopy of human blood smears and in sections from normal midbrain and distal ileum. Lrrk2 reactivity was also detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen (including in dendritic cells), but was absent in splenic mononuclear cells from lrrk2-null mice, as expected. In cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice we made three observations: (i) a predominance of higher molecular weight lrrk2; (ii) the reduction of autophagy marker LC3-II in (R1441C)lrrk2-mutant cells (<31%); and (iii) a significant up-regulation of lrrk2 mRNA (>fourfold) and protein after exposure to several microbial structures including bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lentiviral particles. We conclude that Lrrk2 is a constituent of many cell types in the immune system. Following the recognition of microbial structures, stimulated macrophages respond with altered lrrk2 gene expression. In the same cells, lrrk2 appears to co-regulate autophagy. A pattern recognition receptor-type function for LRRK2 could explain its locus' association with Crohn's disease and leprosy risk. We speculate that the role of Lrrk2 in immune cells may also be relevant to the susceptibility of developing PD or its progression.","2011",,"J Neural Transm (Vienna)",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity, FALSE, Autophagy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, B-Lymphocytes, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cells, Cultured, FALSE, Cytokines, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2, FALSE, Leukocytes, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Macrophages, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Transgenic, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, RNA, Messenger, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, T-Lymphocytes, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Up-Regulation, FALSE, physiology, Q000502",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

It is important to begin to thoroughly characterize this group so that preventative therapies might be tested. Existing cholinotropic agents are a logical choice for preventative therapy as experimental evidence suggests that they are anti-amyloidogenic and clinical trials have shown that they delay progression of mild cognitive impairment to dementia. A detailed understanding of the status of the cortical cholinergic system in preclinical AD is still lacking, however. For more than 30 years, depletion of the cortical cholinergic system has been known to be one of the characteristic features of AD. Reports to date have suggested that some cholinergic markers are altered prior to cognitive impairment while others may show changes only at later stages of dementia. These studies have generally been limited by relatively small sample sizes, long postmortem intervals and insufficient definition of control and AD subjects by the defining histopathology. We, therefore, examined pre- and post-synaptic elements of the cortical cholinergic system in frontal and parietal cortex in 87 deceased subjects, including non-demented elderly with and without amyloid plaques as well as demented persons with neuropathologically confirmed AD. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was used as a presynaptic marker while displacement of (3)H-pirenzepine binding by oxotremorine-M in the presence and absence of GppNHp was used to assess postsynaptic M1 receptor coupling. The results indicate that cortical ChAT activity as well as M1 receptor coupling are both significantly decreased in non-demented elderly subjects with amyloid plaques and are more pronounced in subjects with AD and dementia.

Ninety-eight patients had severe carotid artery stenosis, 41 right (group 1), and 57 left (group 2), while 313 had no significant stenosis (group 3).

Here we hypothesized that the ""disease signature"" of AD-related cortical thinning, previously identified in patients with mild AD dementia, would be useful as a biomarker to detect anatomic abnormalities consistent with AD in cognitively normal (CN) adults who develop AD dementia after longitudinal follow-up.
METHODS: We studied 2 independent samples of adults who were CN when scanned. In sample 1, 8 individuals developing AD dementia (CN-AD converters) after an average of 11.1 years were compared to 25 individuals who remained CN (CN-stable). In sample 2, 7 CN-AD converters (average follow-up 7.1 years) were compared to 25 CN-stable individuals.
RESULTS: AD-signature cortical thinning in CN-AD converters in both samples was remarkably similar, about 0.2 mm (p < 0.05). Despite this small absolute difference, Cohen d effect sizes for these differences were very large (> 1).

METHODS: Cohort study of 12,047 men aged 65-84 years living in Perth, Australia. Adiposity exposures were baseline body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). We used the Western Australian Data Linkage System (WADLS) to establish the presence of new cases of dementia between 1996 and 2009 according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Crude and adjusted hazard ratio (HR, 95% confidence interval, 95%CI) of dementia for each adiposity marker was calculated using Cox regression models. Other measured factors included age, marital status, education, alcohol use, smoking, diet, physical activity, and prevalent hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS: Compared with men with BMI<25, participants with BMI between 25-30 had lower adjusted HR of dementia (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.70-0.95). The HR of dementia for men with BMI ≥ 30 was comparable to men with BMI<25 (HR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.67-1.01). Waist circumference showed no obvious association with dementia hazard. Men with WHR ≥ 0.9 had lower adjusted HR of dementia than men with WHR <0.9 (HR = 0.82, 95%CI  =  0.69-0.98). We found a ""J"" shape association between measures of obesity and the hazard of dementia, with the nadir of risk being in the overweight range of BMI and about 1 for WHR.

Therefore, a biological marker that predicts individual response to antihypertensive treatment would be of high clinical relevance. Midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), an inactive surrogate molecule of the mature atrial natriuretic peptide, is related to circulatory function and hypertension.
METHODS: A sample population of 134 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was followed for up to 6 years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was conducted to predict conversion to AD based on all relevant variables.
RESULTS: Baseline MR-proANP was significantly increased in the AD converter group (p < .0001). The conversion rate of patients treated with antihypertensive drugs was significantly reduced only in patients with elevated MR-proANP at baseline (p = .046). Using an optimized MR-proANP cutoff of 74 pmol/L, representing a value in the upper normal range, treatment with antihypertensive drugs reduced the conversion rate to AD by 36% (p = .035) for patients with levels >74 pmol/L. Further subgrouping by age (>/≤ 72 years at baseline) increased the positive correlation of antihypertensive treatment and MCI outcome for patients below the age of 72 years (conversion rate reduced by 74%, p = .016).

Adult neurogenesis plays an important role in memory function and impaired neurogenesis contributes to cognitive deficits associated with AD. Increased physical/ cognitive activity is associated with both reduced risk of dementia and increased neurogenesis. Previous attempts to restore hippocampal neurogenesis in transgenic mice by voluntary running (RUN) and environmental enrichment (ENR) provided controversial results due to lack of non-transgenic (non-Tg) control and inclusion of social isolation as ""standard"" housing environment. Here, we determine the effect of RUN and ENR upon hippocampal neurogenesis in a triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model of AD, which mimics AD pathology in humans. We used single and double immunohistochemistry to determine the area density of hippocampal proliferating cells, measured by the presence of phosphorylated Histone H3 (HH3), and their potential neuronal and glial phenotype by co-localizing the proliferating cells with the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX), mature neuronal marker (NeuN) and specific astroglial marker (GFAP). Our results show that 3xTg-AD mice in control environment exhibit impaired hippocampal neurogenesis compared to non-Tg animals at 9 months of age. Exposure to RUN and ENR housing restores hippocampal neurogenesis in 3xTg-AD animals to non-Tg control levels. Differentiation into neurones and glial cells is affected neither by transgenic status nor by housing environment. These results suggest that hippocampus of 3xTg-AD animals maintains the potential for cellular plasticity.

To explore the relationship between plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations and AD in aging individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of plasma Aβ and their ratio as a marker for progression to AD. We measured baseline concentrations of Aβ40 and Aβ42, and their ratio in plasma of patients carefully categorized clinically and neurochemically as having AD or other dementias from a cohort of patients with MCI (n=588) after 4-6 years of follow-up time. Plasma concentrations of Aβ40, Aβ42 were measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology. The association between plasma Aβ concentrations and the risk of dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Optimal sensitivity and specificity of Aβ measurements were determined by ROC curve analysis. Plasma Aβ42 concentration and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio at baseline were significantly decreased in the MCI patients who developed AD as compared to cognitively stable MCI patients. The baseline concentrations of Aβ40 were similar in all MCI groups. The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was superior to Aβ42 concentration with regard to identify incipient AD in MCI. The ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 rather than absolute levels of the peptides can aid in the identification of incipient AD among MCI patients.

Hearing loss was defined by a pure-tone average of hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in the better-hearing ear (normal, <25 dB [n = 455]; mild loss, 25-40 dB [n = 125]; moderate loss, 41-70 dB [n = 53]; and severe loss, >70 dB [n = 6]). Diagnosis of incident dementia was made by consensus diagnostic conference. Cox proportional hazards models were used to model time to incident dementia according to severity of hearing loss and were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension.
SETTING: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.
PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred thirty-nine individuals aged 36 to 90 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident cases of all-cause dementia and AD until May 31, 2008.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.9 years, 58 cases of incident all-cause dementia were diagnosed, of which 37 cases were AD. The risk of incident all-cause dementia increased log linearly with the severity of baseline hearing loss (1.27 per 10-dB loss; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.50). Compared with normal hearing, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for incident all-cause dementia was 1.89 (1.00-3.58) for mild hearing loss, 3.00 (1.43-6.30) for moderate hearing loss, and 4.94 (1.09-22.40) for severe hearing loss. The risk of incident AD also increased with baseline hearing loss (1.20 per 10 dB of hearing loss) but with a wider confidence interval (0.94-1.53).

Within the framework, we developed a union-intersection test suitable for genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), candidate gene data, as well as medical sequencing data. The union-intersection test is a composite test of association of genotype frequencies and differential correlation among markers.
RESULTS: We demonstrated by computer simulation that the false positive error rate was controlled at the expected level. We also demonstrated scenarios in which the multi-locus test was more powerful than traditional single marker analysis. To illustrate use of the union-intersection test with real data, we analyzed a publically available data set of 319,813 autosomal SNPs genotyped for 938 cases of Parkinson disease and 863 neurologically normal controls for which no genome-wide significant results were found by traditional single marker analysis. We also analyzed an independent follow-up sample of 183 cases and 248 controls for replication.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a single risk haplotype with a directionally consistent effect in both samples in the gene GAK, which is involved in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking. We also found suggestive evidence that directionally inconsistent marginal effects from single marker analysis appeared to result from risk being driven by different haplotypes in the two samples for the genes SYN3 and NGLY1, which are involved in neurotransmitter release and proteasomal degradation, respectively.

MEASUREMENTS: Annual cognitive assessments, average follow-up of 4.4 years, including classification of incident cognitive impairment and probable dementia. Height, weight, waist, and hip measurements were assessed at baseline, and a waist-hip ratio (WHR) of 0.8 or greater was used as a marker of central adiposity.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant interactions between BMI and WHR and incident cognitive impairment and probable dementia with and without adjustment for a panel of cognitive risk factors.

Moreover, an association of the ultrasound sign with a number of risk and premotor markers has been shown. However, the most striking argument for a relevance of SN hyperechogenicity in healthy subjects can be derived from the observation that some initially healthy subjects with SN hyperechogenicity developed PD in the long run, an observation which has led to longitudinal studies on the predictive value of the ultrasound sign for the development of PD.

The present view summarizes current scientific evidence favouring the idea that the TCS finding of SN hyperechogenicity alone may not be a (strong) risk marker of PD. Especially, it is discussed how reliable this TCS finding is, whether this TCS finding can be regarded as a progression marker or a risk marker of PD, how strongly it may indicate a risk of PD, what else if not an increased risk of PD could be indicated, and which role TCS of SN may finally play in the detection of subjects at risk of PD.","2011",,"J Neural Transm (Vienna)",," review","Disease Progression, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Reproducibility of Results, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, standards, Q000592, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial, FALSE, methods, Q000379",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"21130233","[Telomeres in the brain cortex of depressive patients].","Teyssier JR","BACKGROUND: Telomeres are complex structures formed by the end of the DNA molecule at the tip of chromosomal arms. The telomeric sequence, which results from the repetition of the hexanucleotide TTAGGG, is partly single strand and is associated with more than ten proteins, including the enzyme telomerase. Because of the characteristics of the DNA replication process, only telomerase is able to elongate the telomeric sequence. Since the telomerase gene is repressed in virtually all the somatic cells, telomeres progressively shorten at each S phase of the cell cycle, and this shortening is accelerated by oxidative stress. A critically shortened telomere activates the genetic program of cell senescence and/or apoptosis. The telomere length measured in peripheral blood leucocytes is considered a reliable marker of biological age, mortality risk and exposure to various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular disease, dementia and metabolic syndrome. Telomere erosion has been observed in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and mood disorders, suggesting an accelerated aging of 10 to 20 years. Whether this peripheral dynamic is reflected by a similar pattern in the brain remains unknown. To address this issue, we have measured the telomere length in the occipital DNA cortex of 24 patients with major depressive disorder and 12 controls (donated by the Stanley Research Institute).
METHODOLOGY: The mean telomere length has been evaluated by a real time quantitative PCR technique, which amplified the telomere sequence and a reference single copy sequence. Results have been expressed by the ratios of Ct obtained for the two amplification curves.
RESULTS: The mean Ct values were strictly identical (0.79 ± 0.001) and the 36 PCR curves were coincident.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates for the first time that there is no shortening of telomeres in the cortex of patients with depressive disorder. Previous results have shown that in normal tissues telomeres length is inversely correlated to age, even in non proliferating tissues, but that the change is minimal in the brain. Thus, although consistent evidence for the role of a systemic and brain inflammation associated oxidative stress in depression has been provided, it must be concluded that the cerebral state of telomeres is not affected by the mechanism operating in the leucocytes. This observation raises the issue of the relation between the psychiatric pathological process and the peripheral telomere marker. It suggests the existence of specific telomere stabilizing factors in the cortex cells.","2010",,"Encephale",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Affective Disorders, Psychotic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Age Factors, FALSE, Apoptosis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cause of Death, FALSE, Depressive Disorder, Major, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Female, FALSE, France, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Leukocytes, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Occipital Lobe, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Polymerase Chain Reaction, FALSE, Reference Values, FALSE, Suicide, FALSE, psychology, Q000523, Telomere, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

There is also increasing evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) elsewhere in the gene are associated with PD risk.
OBJECTIVES: To further explore the association of common SNCA SNPs with PD susceptibility, to determine whether evidence of allelic heterogeneity exists, and to examine the correlation between PD-associated variants and plasma α-synuclein levels.
DESIGN: Two-tiered analysis.
SETTING: Academic research.
PATIENTS: Patients and control subjects from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We performed a 2-tiered analysis of 1956 patients with PD and 2112 controls from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium using a comprehensive tag SNP approach. Previously published REP1 genotypes were also included. Plasma α-synuclein was assayed in 86 patients with PD and 78 controls using a highly sensitive Luminex assay.
RESULTS: Five of 15 SNPs genotyped were associated with PD under an additive model in tier 1 (α = .05). Of these, 4 were successfully replicated in tier 2. In the combined sample, the most significant marker was rs356219 (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.55; P = 1.6 × 10(-12)), located approximately 9 kilobases downstream from the gene. A regression model containing rs356219 alone best fit the data. The linkage disequilibrium correlation coefficient between this SNP and REP1 was low (r(2) = 0.09). The risk-associated C allele of rs356219 was also correlated with higher transformed plasma α-synuclein levels in patients under an adjusted additive model (P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that 1 or more unidentified functional SNCA variants modify risk for PD and that the effect is larger than and independent of REP1. This variant(s), tagged by rs356219, might act by upregulating SNCA expression in a dose-dependent manner.","2010",,"Arch Neurol"," OBJECTIVES : To further explore the association of common SNCA SNPs with PD susceptibility , to determine whether evidence of allelic heterogeneity exists , and to examine the correlation between PD-associated variants and plasma α-synuclein levels ","other","Alleles, FALSE, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Association Studies, FALSE, Genetic Heterogeneity, FALSE, Genetic Linkage, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Haplotypes, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Logistic Models, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Odds Ratio, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, Promoter Regions, Genetic, TRUE, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, blood, Q000097",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

However, up to the present, no validated extracerebral diagnostic markers for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) are available. The clinical diagnosis of probable AD is made with around 90% accuracy using modern clinical, neuropsychological and imaging methods. A biochemical marker that would support the clinical diagnosis and distinguish AD from other causes of dementia would therefore be of great value as a screening test. A total of 126 samples were obtained from subjects with AD, and age-sex-matched controls. Additionally, 51 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were used as an example of another neurodegenerative disorder. We analyzed saliva and plasma levels of β amyloid (Aβ) using a highly sensitive ELISA kit.
RESULTS: We found a small but statistically significant increase in saliva Aβ42 levels in mild AD patients. In addition, there were not differences in saliva concentration of Aβ42 between patients with PD and healthy controls. Saliva Aβ40 expression was unchanged within all the studied sample. The association between saliva Aβ42 levels and AD was independent of established risk factors, including age or Apo E, but was dependent on sex and functional capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that saliva Aβ42 levels could be considered a potential peripheral marker of AD and help discrimination from other types of neurodegenerative disorders.

The objectives of this study were to examine changes in DA turnover in the asymptomatic PD phase; to compare them with changes in other dopaminergic markers, and to investigate a possible relationship between DAT and DA turnover. Eight subjects from families at increased risk of PD due to LRRK2 mutation were investigated. Positron emission tomography imaging was performed with: ¹⁸F-fluorodopa to determine the effective DA distribution volume (EDV), the inverse of DA turnover, and the DA uptake rate K(occ), a marker of DA synthesis and storage; ¹¹C-methylphenidate (MP, a DAT marker) and ¹¹C-dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ, a VMAT2 marker) to estimate the binding potentials BP(ND_MP) and BP(ND_DTBZ). On average, EDV showed the largest reduction from age-matched control values (42%) followed by BP(ND_MP) (23%) and BP(ND_DTBZ) (17%), whereas K(occ) remained in the normal range for all subjects. No correlation was found between EDV and any other marker. DA turnover was found to be elevated in asymptomatic mutation carriers at increased risk of PD. Such change was determined to be larger than and statistically independent from changes observed with the other markers.

We investigated both issues in a large population-based sample of elderly individuals.
METHODS: Severity of dVRS was semiquantitatively graded in both white matter and basal ganglia using high-resolution 3-dimensional MRI images taken from 1818 stroke- and dementia-free subjects enrolled in the Three-City Dijon MRI study. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to model the association of cardiovascular risk factors, APOE genotype, brain atrophy, and MRI markers of small vessel disease with the degree of dVRS.
RESULTS: Severity of dVRS was found to be strongly associated with age in both basal ganglia (degree 4 versus 1: OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2) and white matter (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9). The proportion of hypertensive subjects increased with the degrees of dVRS in both basal ganglia (P = 0.02) and white matter (P = 0.048). Men presented a higher risk of severe dVRS in basal ganglia than women, particularly degree 4 (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.8 to 19.8). The degree of dVRS was associated with the volume of white matter hyperintensities and the prevalence of lacunes, but not with brain atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study of elderly subjects, the degree of dVRS appears independently associated with age, hypertension, volume of white matter hyperintensities, and lacunar infarctions. dVRS should be considered as another MRI marker of cerebral small vessel disease in the elderly with regional variations in their severity.","2010",,"Stroke","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Little is known about the risk factors of dilated Virchow-Robin spaces ( dVRS ) and their relation with other markers of brain small vessel disease ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Basal Ganglia Cerebrovascular Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Blood Pressure, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Dilatation, Pathologic, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hypertension, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Logistic Models, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Microvessels, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Severity of Illness Index, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Thus, visual testing could be used as an aid to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. In the present study, exploratory eye movement was measured to evaluate visual cognitive function in elderly subjects, including those with dementia.
METHODS: We analyzed responsive search scores (RSS) from exploratory eye movements of 300 subjects who were examined with an eye mark recorder while viewing S shaped figures. Subjects were divided into three groups (dementia, intermediate, healthy) from the values of the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating. We further divided the intermediate groups into two subgroups, the high score and low score groups, based on RSS. In 202 subjects, Z-scores of voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: RSS of the dementia group were significantly lower than those in the intermediate and healthy groups, in order: dementia < intermediate < healthy groups. RSS of the low score intermediate group was significantly lower than that of the high score intermediate group. There was no significant difference between the low score intermediate and dementia groups, or between the high score intermediate and healthy groups. No significant differences of either HSD-R or MMSE were observed between the low score and the high score intermediate groups. The Z-score of VSRAD using MRI in the low score intermediate group was significantly higher than that in the high score intermediate group.

METHOD: Two hundred twelve community-dwelling older adults, initially aged 64-92 years, remained in the study after 5 years. Inconsistency was calculated from baseline reaction time performance. Participants were assigned to groups on the basis of their fluctuations in CIND classification over time. Logistic and Cox regressions were used.
RESULTS: Baseline inconsistency significantly distinguished among those who remained or transitioned into CIND over the 5 years and those who were consistently intact (e.g., stable intact vs. stable CIND, Wald (1) = 7.91, p < .01, Exp(β) = 1.49). Average level of inconsistency over time was also predictive of study attrition, for example, Wald (1) = 11.31, p < .01, Exp(β) = 1.24.
CONCLUSIONS: For both outcomes, greater inconsistency was associated with a greater likelihood of being in a maladaptive group 5 years later. Variability based on moderately cognitively challenging tasks appeared to be particularly sensitive to longitudinal changes in cognitive ability. Mean rate of responding was a comparable predictor of change in most instances, but individuals were at greater relative risk of being in a maladaptive outcome group if they were more inconsistent rather than if they were slower in responding.

METHODS: We compared measures of RBD patients confirmed by polysomnography (PSG) with groups of age/gender-matched Control subjects and early PD (EPD) patients (Hoehn & Yahr < 2). Clinical measurements included the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scales (UPDRS), timed gait and finger tapping tasks, the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and a time-synchronized video recorded single-night PSG. Volumetric measurements were derived from high-resolution T1-weighted 3 T MRI images.
RESULTS: The matched Control and EPD groups were statistically similar to the RBD group in age, gender, handedness, and total brain volumes. The RBD group had smaller bilateral putamen volumes (both raw and normalized by brain tissue volume), in addition to some clinical impairment on the UPDRS and PDQ-39.

Reductions in cerebral glucose metabolic rate (CMRglu) as measured by fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in parietotemporal, frontal, and cingulate cortices are associated with increased AD risk and can be observed years before dementia onset.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether greater homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is associated with reduced resting CMRglu in areas vulnerable in AD in cognitively normal adults with newly diagnosed PD or T2D (PD/T2D), and to determine whether adults with PD/T2D have abnormal patterns of CMRglu during a memory encoding task.
DESIGN: Randomized crossover design of resting and activation FDG-PET.
SETTING: University imaging center and Veterans Affairs clinical research unit.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three older adults (mean [SEM] age, 74.4 [1.4] years) with no prior diagnosis of diabetes but who met American Diabetes Association glycemic criteria for PD (n = 11) or diabetes (n = 12) based on fasting or 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose values and 6 adults (mean [SEM] age, 74.3 [2.8] years) with normal fasting glucose values and glucose tolerance. No participant met Petersen criteria for mild cognitive impairment.
INTERVENTIONS: Fasting participants underwent resting and cognitive activation FDG-PET imaging on separate days. Following a 30-minute transmission scan, subjects received an intravenous injection of 5 mCi of FDG, and the emission scan commenced 40 minutes after injection. In the activation condition, a 35-minute memory encoding task was initiated at the time of tracer injection. Subjects were instructed to remember a repeating list of 20 words randomly presented in series through earphones. Delayed free recall was assessed once the emission scan was complete.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The HOMA-IR value was calculated using fasting glucose and insulin values obtained during OGTT screening and then correlated with CMRglu values obtained during the resting scan. Resting CMRglu values were also subtracted from CMRglu values obtained during the memory encoding activation scan to examine task-related patterns of CMRglu.
RESULTS: Greater insulin resistance was associated with an AD-like pattern of reduced CMRglu in frontal, parietotemporal, and cingulate regions in adults with PD/T2D. The relationship between CMRglu and HOMA-IR was independent of age, 2-hour OGTT glucose concentration, or apolipoprotein E ε4 allele carriage. During the memory encoding task, healthy adults showed activation in right anterior and inferior prefrontal cortices, right inferior temporal cortex, and medial and posterior cingulate regions. Adults with PD/T2D showed a qualitatively different pattern during the memory encoding task, characterized by more diffuse and extensive activation, and recalled fewer items on the delayed memory test.

As an increasing number of studies indicate that this ultrasound feature may even be evident before motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease occur, longitudinal studies revealing its value as a screening instrument for subjects at risk are awaited with great expectancy. At the same time, other studies have shown that SN hyperechogenicity is not only found in Parkinson's disease but also in other disease entities. Limitations and pitfalls of the method need to be considered to evaluate and compare these studies. Taking these into account, it is important to realize that in some other neurodegenerative diseases as well as in disorders associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease hyperechogenicity can be found--usually, however, less prevalent. Interestingly, even in subgroups of patients with non-neurodegenerative disorders, SN hyperechogenicity can be detected. This holds, for example, true for multiple sclerosis patients with a higher rate of disease progression. In this disorder, microglia activation is known to occur, which is also evident in Parkinson's disease. This pathomechanism as well as increased iron content is known to contribute to SN hyperechogenicity. From the studies published so far it can be concluded that, although SN hyperechogenicity is not only found in Parkinson's disease, assessment of the echogenicity of the SN and other ultrasound features is valuable in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes and most probably in subjects at risk.

METHODS: a total of 62 elderly caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (mean age: 74 years) were assessed for plasma concentrations of IL-6, caregiving-related overload, and coping self-efficacy. Multiple regression was used to examine the main effects of stress and self-efficacy, as well as the interaction between stress and self-efficacy, in predicting plasma IL-6 after controlling for age, gender, resting blood pressure, and obesity.
RESULTS: there was a significant interaction between stress and self-efficacy in predicting IL-6. Post-hoc examination indicated that when self-efficacy was low, stress was significantly related to IL-6 (β = 0.43). However, when self-efficacy was high, stress was not significantly related to IL-6 (β = -0.10).
CONCLUSION: caregiving stress in combination with low coping self-efficacy is significantly related to IL-6, a known risk marker for health morbidity, particularly CVD.

The incidence of neuropsychiatric features of PD, including cognitive decline and visual hallucinations, was ascertained through chart review after an average of 6.8 years of follow-up. Incidence of motor outcomes including falls and dyskinesias was also obtained. There was a significant trend for increased risk of neuropsychiatric complications across declining quartiles of olfactory test scores. In addition, subjects in the lowest quartile of olfactory performance had a significantly higher adjusted risk of hallucinations (HR = 4.70, 95% CI 1.64, 13.42) and cognitive decline (HR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.05, 9.21) than those in the reference quartile.

METHODS: We evaluated physical activity in relation to PD among 213,701 participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort. Physical activities over 4 periods (ages 15-18, 19-29, and 35-39, and in the past 10 years) were noted in 1996-1997, and physician-diagnosed PD was reported on the 2004-2006 follow-up questionnaire. Only cases diagnosed after 2000 (n = 767) were included in the analyses.
RESULTS: Higher levels of moderate to vigorous activities at ages 35-39 or in the past 10 years as reported in 1996-1997 were associated with lower PD occurrence after 2000 with significant dose-response relationships. The multivariate odds ratios (OR) between the highest vs the lowest levels were 0.62 (95% CI confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.81, p for trend 0.005) for ages 35-39 and 0.65 (95% CI 0.51-0.83, p for trend 0.0001) for in the past 10 years. Further analyses showed that individuals with consistent and frequent participation in moderate to vigorous activities in both periods had approximately a 40% lower risk than those who were inactive in both periods. Moderate to vigorous activities at earlier ages or light activities were not associated with PD. Finally, the association between higher moderate to vigorous physical activities and lower PD risk was demonstrated in a metaanalysis of prospective studies.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed from 1966 to 23 November 2009.
STUDY SELECTION: Prospective longitudinal studies that used magnetic resonance imaging and assessed the impact of white matter hyperintensities on risk of incident stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and death, and, for the meta-analysis, studies that provided risk estimates for a categorical measure of white matter hyperintensities, assessing the impact of these lesions on risk of stroke, dementia, and death.
DATA EXTRACTION: Population studied, duration of follow-up, method used to measure white matter hyperintensities, definition of the outcome, and measure of the association of white matter hyperintensities with the outcome.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 46 longitudinal studies evaluated the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke (n=12), cognitive decline (n=19), dementia (n=17), and death (n=10). 22 studies could be included in a meta-analysis (nine of stroke, nine of dementia, eight of death). White matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 4.4), dementia (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and death (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7). An association of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline in global cognitive performance, executive function, and processing speed was also suggested.
CONCLUSION: White matter hyperintensities predict an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death.

However, the severity, frequency, and characterization of cognitive difficulties have not been well-described. Applying similar cutoffs to those used in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) research, the current study examined the rates of subtle cognitive dysfunction (e.g., dysfunction that does not meet criteria for dementia) in pre-HD.
METHODS: Using baseline data from 160 non-gene-expanded comparison participants, normative data were established for cognitive tests of episodic memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and visuospatial perception. Cutoff scores at 1.5 standard deviations below the mean of the comparison group were then applied to 575 gene-expanded pre-HD participants from the observational study, PREDICT-HD, who were stratified by motor signs and genetic risk for HD.
RESULTS: Nearly 40% of pre-HD individuals met criteria for MCI, and individuals closer to HD diagnosis had higher rates of MCI. Nonamnestic MCI was more common than amnestic MCI. Single-domain MCI was more common than multiple-domain MCI. Within the nonamnestic single-domain subtype, impairments in processing speed were most frequent.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the Alzheimer disease literature, MCI as a prodromal period is a valid concept in pre-HD, with nearly 40% of individuals showing this level of impairment before diagnosis.

In this study, we aimed to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in individuals with AD dementia and cognitively healthy elderly individuals, and to investigate their relationship with established CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: CSF was collected from 38 individuals with AD dementia and 34 cognitively healthy elderly individuals. The CSF was analyzed for MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta42), total tau protein (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau). MMP/TIMP-1 ratios were calculated. APOE genotype was determined for the participants.
RESULTS: AD patients had higher MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios and lower TIMP-1 levels compared to cognitively healthy individuals. In AD patients, the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio correlated with CSF T-tau, a marker of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, the cognitively healthy individuals with risk markers for future AD, i.e. AD-supportive CSF biomarker levels of T-tau, P-tau and Abeta42 or the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele, had higher CSF MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels and higher CSF MMP-3/TIMP-1 ratios compared to the healthy individuals without risk markers. The CSF levels of MMP-3 and -9 in the control group also correlated with the CSF T-tau and P-tau levels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that MMP-3 and MMP-9 might be involved in early pathogenesis of AD and that MMPs could be associated with neuronal degeneration and formation of neurofibrillary tangles even prior to development of overt cognitive dysfunction.","2010",,"Alzheimers Res Ther"," In this study , we aimed to examine the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) levels of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP-1 ) in individuals with AD dementia and cognitively healthy elderly individuals , and to investigate their relationship with established CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease ","other","NULL",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The pathophysiology of iRBD is likely due to dysfunction of brainstem nuclei that regulate REM sleep. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a method for studying microstructural brain tissue integrity in vivo. We investigated whether DTI detects microstructural abnormalities in the brain of patients with iRBD--compared with age-matched control subjects--as an in vivo potential indicator for changes related to ""preclinical (premotor)"" neuropathology in PD.
DESIGN: N/A.
PATIENTS: Patients with iRBD (n = 12) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 12) were studied.
INTERVENTIONS: At a 1.5T MRI maschine, whole-head DTI scans of fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity (a potential marker of neuronal loss), and radial diffusivity (a potential marker of glial pathology) were analyzed using track-based spatial statistics, and 2 types of group analysis tools (FreeSurfer and FSL).
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We found significant microstructural changes in the white matter of the brainstem (P < 0.0001), the right substantia nigra, the olfactory region, the left temporal lobe, the fornix, the internal capsule, the corona radiata, and the right visual stream of the patients with iRBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes were identified in regions known to be involved in REM-sleep regulation and/or to exhibit neurodegenerative pathology in iRBD and/or early PD.

Even in asymptomatic elderly, a small hippocampal volume on magnetic resonance imaging is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease. However, not everyone with a small hippocampus develops dementia. With the increased interest in the use of sequential magnetic resonance images as potential surrogate biomarkers of the disease process, it has also been shown that the rate of hippocampal atrophy is higher in persons with Alzheimer's disease compared to those with mild cognitive impairment and the healthy elderly. Whether a higher rate of hippocampal atrophy also predicts Alzheimer's disease or subtle cognitive decline in non-demented elderly is unknown. We examine these associations in a group of 518 elderly (age 60-90 years, 50% female), taken from the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study. A magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at baseline in 1995-96 that was repeated in 1999-2000 (in 244 persons) and in 2006 (in 185 persons). Using automated segmentation procedures, we assessed hippocampal volumes on all magnetic resonance imaging scans. All persons were free of dementia at baseline and followed over time for cognitive decline and incident dementia. Persons had four repeated neuropsychological tests at the research centre over a 10-year period. We also continuously monitored the medical records of all 518 participants for incident dementia. During a total follow-up of 4360 person-years, (mean 8.4, range 0.1-11.3), 50 people developed incident dementia (36 had Alzheimer's disease). We found an increased risk to develop incident dementia per standard deviation faster rate of decline in hippocampal volume [left hippocampus 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2-2.3, right hippocampus 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2-2.1)]. Furthermore, decline in hippocampal volume predicted onset of clinical dementia when corrected for baseline hippocampal volume. In people who remained free of dementia during the whole follow-up period, we found that decline in hippocampal volume paralleled, and preceded, specific decline in delayed word recall. No associations were found in this sample between rate of hippocampal atrophy, Mini Mental State Examination and tests of executive function. Our results suggest that rate of hippocampal atrophy is an early marker of incipient memory decline and dementia, and could be of additional value when compared with a single hippocampal volume measurement as a surrogate biomarker of dementia.","2010",,"Brain"," Whether a higher rate of hippocampal atrophy also predicts Alzheimer's disease or subtle cognitive decline in non-demented elderly is unknown ","comparative study","Age of Onset, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Hippocampus, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Mental Recall, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Middle Aged, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Little is known about the association of the burden of coronary atherosclerosis with brain structure and function.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Age, Gene, Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study cohort of men and women born 1907 to 1935. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of atherosclerotic burden, was measured with CT. Memory, speed of processing, and executive function composites were calculated from a cognitive test battery. Dementia was assessed in a multistep procedure and diagnosed according to international guidelines. Quantitative data on total intracranial and tissue volumes (total, gray matter volume, white matter volume, and white matter lesion volume), cerebral infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds were obtained with brain MRI. The association of CAC with dementia (n=165 cases) and cognitive function in nondemented subjects (n=4085), and separately with MRI outcomes, was examined in multivariate models adjusting for demographic and vascular risk factors. Analyses tested whether brain structure mediated the associations of CAC to cognitive function.
RESULTS: Subjects with higher CAC were more likely to have dementia and lower cognitive scores, more likely to have lower white matter volume, gray matter volume, and total brain tissue, and to have more cerebral infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and white matter lesions. The relations of cognitive performance and dementia to CAC were significantly attenuated when the models were adjusted for brain lesions and volumes.

METHODS: We cross-sectionally examined 447 community-dwelling and stroke-free individuals from the Systematic Evaluation and Alteration of Risk Factors for Cognitive Health (SEARCH) Health Study (mean age 63 years, 248 female). High-field MRI was performed in 321 of these subjects.

Psychometric analyses covered verbal memory, word fluency, and executive functions.
RESULTS: Higher levels of hs-CRP were associated with worse performance in executive function after adjustment for age, gender, education, and cardiovascular risk factors in multiple regression analysis (beta = -0.095, p = 0.02).

,"20219426","Daytime sleepiness is associated with dementia and cognitive decline in older Italian adults: a population-based study.","Merlino G","OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of dementia among the elderly has been associated with several, often not modifiable, risk factors. Recent epidemiological studies focused their interest on a possible association between cognitive decline and sleep, a potentially modifiable risk factor. Due to controversial results and limitations of the previous studies, we decided to reexamine the relationship between disturbed sleep and cognitive impairment in the elderly.
METHODS: Seven hundred fifty subjects aged 65years or older were recruited. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) scores were used to evaluate the severity of cognitive decline. Diagnosis of dementia was made by means of the DSM-IV criteria. The older adults were interviewed in order to assess the presence of several sleep complaints (insomnia, snoring and/or witnessed sleep apneas, restlessness and/or leg jerks, sleepwalking and nightmares). Excessive daytime sleepiness was evaluated by means of a validated questionnaire. The principal caregiver of each older adult took part in the interview, providing the information if the subject was unable to answer because of mental impairment.
RESULTS: Eighty-six individuals were diagnosed as demented; a large part of them (47.8%), in particular, were recognized as being affected by Alzheimer's disease. The prevalence of each sleep complaint in the older adults was as follows: insomnia 84.7%, snoring and/or witnessed sleep apneas 26.2%, restlessness and/or jerks in the legs 25.7%, sleepwalking 0.5%, nightmares 6.4% and daytime somnolence 30.6%. Among sleep disturbances, excessive daytime sleepiness was independently associated with the presence of dementia in the elderly. In addition, the frequency of excessive daytime sleepiness increased progressively across the different categories of cognitive decline, as measured by means of MMSE and GDS scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia, the most common sleep complaint in our sample, was not associated with the presence of cognitive decline. As opposed to insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly related to dementia. Further studies are needed in order to investigate the direction of this association and to evaluate the possible role of daytime somnolence as an early marker of neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease, in some older adults.","2010",,"Sleep Med"," OBJECTIVE : The occurrence of dementia among the elderly has been associated with several , often not modifiable , risk factors ","other","Aged, FALSE, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Dementia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Disorders of Excessive Somnolence, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Italy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Population Surveillance, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Prevalence, FALSE, Severity of Illness Index, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Recent focus has been placed on understanding the long-term consequences of chronic cardiovascular disease, such as a potential increased risk of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether there is an association between AF and dementia and whether their coexistence is an independent marker of risk.
METHODS: A total of 37,025 consecutive patients from the large ongoing prospective Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study database were evaluated and followed up for a mean of 5 years for the development of AF and dementia. Dementia was sub-typed into vascular (VD), senile (SD), Alzheimer's (AD), and nonspecified (ND).
RESULTS: Of the 37,025 patients with a mean age of 60.6 +/- 17.9 years, 10,161 (27%) developed AF and 1,535 (4.1%) developed dementia (179 VD, 321 SD, 347 AD, 688 ND) during the 5-year follow-up. Patients with dementia were older and had higher rates of hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal failure, heart failure, and prior strokes. In age-based analysis, AF independently was significantly associated with all dementia types. The highest risk was in the younger group (<70).

Recently, impaired mitochondrial function has emerged as a potential marker for age-related diseases and the maintenance of mtDNA copy number is essential for the preservation of mitochondrial function. We investigated the association between mtDNA copy number and cognitive function in elderly women.
METHODS: A total of 107 apparently healthy elderly women were included. Cognitive abilities were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We measured mtDNA copy number in peripheral leukocytes using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Additionally, cardiometabolic risk factors and physical function were measured.
RESULTS: MMSE scores were negatively correlated with the homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores and positively correlated with gait speed as well as mtDNA copy number. After adjusting for age and level of education, the mean values of MMSE scores gradually increased with mtDNA copy number when divided into quartiles. Using step-wise multiple regression analysis, gait speed, mtDNA copy number, and age were determined to be the strongest predictors of MMSE score.

There is considerable interest in discovering markers to diagnose this preclinical stage. Current predictive marker development stems mainly from two principles; first, that pathologic processes occur in lower brainstem regions before substantia nigra involvement and second, that redundancy and compensatory responses cause symptoms to emerge only after advanced degeneration. Decreased olfaction has recently been demonstrated to predict PD in prospective pathologic studies, although the lead time may be relatively short and the positive predictive value and specificity are low. Screening patients for depression and personality changes, autonomic symptoms, subtle motor dysfunction on quantitative testing, sleepiness and insomnia are other potential simple markers. More invasive measures such as detailed autonomic testing, cardiac MIBG-scintigraphy, transcranial ultrasound, and dopaminergic functional imaging may be especially useful in those at high risk or for further defining risk in those identified through primary screening. Despite intriguing leads, direct testing of preclinical markers has been limited, mainly because there is no reliable way to identify preclinical disease. Idiopathic RBD is characterized by loss of normal atonia with REM sleep. Approximately 50% of affected individuals will develop PD or dementia within 10 years. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to test potential predictive markers before clinical disease onset.

The accumulation of age-related somatic damage combined with a failure of compensatory mechanisms may lead to an acceleration of PD with age. The formation of Lewy bodies may represent a marker for protective mechanisms against age-related dysfunction and degeneration of the nervous system. Mild parkinsonian signs may be present in older people, which are associated with reduced function. These may be due to age-related decline in dopaminergic activity, incidental Lewy body disease, degenerative pathologies (early PD and Alzheimer's disease) or vascular pathology. Ageing may affect the clinical presentation of PD with altered drug side effects, increased risk of developing dementia and an increased likelihood of admission to a nursing home. Progression of PD, including the development of dementia, and hallucinations is related to the age of the patient rather than the age of disease onset.

At present, their diagnosis must be confirmed by post-mortem examination of the brain. Currently the ante-mortem diagnosis is still based on the integration of multiple data (clinical, paraclinical and biological analyses) because no unique marker exists for such diseases. The detection of specific biomarkers would be useful to develop a differential diagnostic, distinguishing not only different neurodegenerative diseases but also the disease from the non-pathological effects of aging. Several neurodegenerative biomarkers are present at very low levels during the early stages of the disease development and their ultra-low detection is needed for early diagnosis, which should permit more effective therapeutic interventions, before the disease concerned can progress to a stage where considerable damage to the brain has already occurred. In the case of prion diseases, there are concerns regarding not only patient care, but the wider community too, with regard to the risk of transmission of prions, especially during blood transfusion, for which, four cases of variant CJD infection associated with transfusion of non-leukocyte-depleted blood components have been confirmed.

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-three older adults (58 with mild to moderate AD, 74 with MCI and 31 healthy controls) were recruited for this study. Serum IL-1beta levels were measured by ELISA. Patients with MCI were subcategorized in single-domain amnestic (aMCI), nonamnestic (naMCI), and multiple-domain (mdMCI) subtypes.
RESULTS: Patients with AD and MCI (all subtypes) had a significant increase in serum IL-1beta levels as compared to controls (p = 0.03). Patients with mdMCI had serum IL-1beta levels comparable to those with AD, and significantly higher than those observed in aMCI and naMCI (p = 0.02).
DISCUSSION: The present study provides evidence that inflammatory mechanisms, represented by elevated IL-1beta, are observed in patients with MCI, specifically in those with impairment in multiple cognitive domains.

This study investigates the role of specific hemostatic and inflammatory pathways with incident vascular and nonvascular dementia.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective study of a population sample of men aged 65 to 84 years, with baseline assessment of hemostatic and inflammatory factors and cognition measured 17 years later. The sample included 865 men (59 had dementia and 112 had cognitive impairment, not dementia), free of vascular disease at baseline and for whom hemostatic and inflammatory marker data were available and cognitive status was known. A total of 15 hemostatic and 6 inflammatory markers were assessed. Factor analysis was used to identify hemostatic subsystems. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurologie criteria were used to identify vascular dementia. By using standardized (z) scores for hemostatic and inflammatory markers, and after adjustment for age and risk factors, vascular dementia was associated with fibrinogen (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.76), factor VIII (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.09-3.00), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.73-5.70). For vascular dementia, the HR risk from high levels of all three hemostatic variables (fibrinogen, factor VIII, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) was 2.97 (P<0.001).

We review the structural MRI studies carried out in PD using either a manual region of interest (ROI) approach or voxel-based morphometry (VBM). ROI studies have shown that hippocampal volume is decreased in patients with PD with and without dementia; in addition, hippocampal atrophy correlated with deficits in verbal memory. VBM studies have demonstrated that dementia in PD involves structural changes in limbic areas and widespread cortical atrophy. Findings in nondemented patients with PD are less conclusive, possibly because cognitively heterogeneous groups of patients have been studied.

A number of clinical premotor markers which are helpful especially in the early diagnosis are being discussed; however, they are mostly unspecific and already signs of the progressing neurodegenerative process. An increasingly important risk marker for PD is genetic predisposition, as the number of known disease causing and modulating genes is increasing. Still, only the minority of PD cases can be attributed to monogenetic forms. Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, assessed by transcranial sonography, has been shown to be a typical marker for PD. Because of its stability during the disease course, this echofeature is very helpful in early and differential diagnosis. Moreover, functional neuroimaging studies indicate a vulnerability of the nigrostriatal system of yet healthy subjects with SN hyperechogenicity. This vulnerability may become clinically relevant with age, under neuroleptic therapy, or under demanding motor tasks. The fact that still unaffected mutation carriers for monogenetic PD show this echofeature and that over the years some subjects with SN hyperechogenicity have already been observed to develop PD indicates that it may be regarded as a risk factor--a hypothesis which is currently being investigated in large prospective investigations.","2009",,"Mov Disord",," review","Disease Progression, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Neostriatum, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Reproducibility of Results, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial, TRUE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

However, the longitudinal course of apathy in PD has not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the occurrence of and risk factors for apathy over time in a representative sample of patients with PD.
METHODS: A sample of 139 patients was drawn from a population-based prevalence study of PD in Rogaland County, Western Norway. Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, using a composite score >or=4 to indicate clinically significant apathy. Additional measurements included standardised rating scales for parkinsonism, depression and cognitive impairment. A follow-up evaluation was carried out in 79 patients (78.2% of the survivors) 4 years later.
RESULTS: Of the 79 patients included in this study, 29 patients (36.7%) had never had apathy, 11 (13.9%) had persistent apathy, and a further 39 (49.4%) developed apathy during follow-up. At follow-up, patients with apathy were more frequently depressed and demented than never-apathetic patients. Dementia at baseline and a more rapid decline in speech and axial impairment during follow-up were independent risk factors for incident apathy.

CC abnormalities in bipolar disorder have been identified in both pediatric and adult populations. In adults, a consistent finding has been a reduction in CC size, as well as abnormal axonal orientation or structure. Axonal abnormalities have also been noted in pediatric populations, but overall CC size reductions have not thus far been demonstrated.

We have developed a simple method, based on a novel extension of moving average plots (MAP), which allows investigators to inspect the frequency data for hidden age-related variations. MAP uses the standard case-control association data and generates a birds-eye view of the frequency distributions across the age spectrum; a picture in which one can see if, how, and when the marker frequencies in cases differ from that in controls. The marker can be specified as an allele, genotype, haplotype, or environmental factor; and age can be age-at-onset, age when subject was last known to be unaffected, or duration of exposure. Signature patterns that emerge can help distinguish true disease associations from spurious associations due to age effects, age-varying associations from associations that are uniform across all ages, and associations with risk from associations with age-at-onset. Utility of MAP is illustrated by application to genetic and epidemiological association data for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Inflammation increases with age, and the number of people reaching age 90 years and older is growing, making the association between inflammation and dementia increasingly relevant. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined whether high levels of serum CRP are associated with increased odds of prevalent dementia in the oldest-old.
METHODS: Serum CRP levels of 305 participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 94.3 +/- 2.9 years) from the 90+ Study, a longitudinal cohort study of people aged 90 years and older, were evaluated with respect to all-cause dementia. Levels of CRP were divided into three categories: undetectable (<0.5 mg/dL), detectable (0.5-0.7 mg/dL), and elevated (> or =0.8 mg/dL). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression, and were adjusted for covariates.
RESULTS: Relative to participants with undetectable CRP levels, participants with detectable or elevated CRP levels had increased odds of all-cause dementia (detectable: OR, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-7.3; elevated: OR, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-12.9). When participants were subdivided by gender, significantly increased ORs were seen only in women.

A comparison of Parkinson's disease patients, disease controls and healthy individuals.","Song IU","BACKGROUND: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a sensitive systemic marker of inflammation, and increased levels of hs-CRP are associated with inflammatory reactions. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation has been hypothesized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the clinical value of hs-CRP in PD is poorly defined. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the clinical value of hs-CRP in patients with PD.
METHODS: We examined 212 patients with de novo PD, 253 patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease and 119 healthy subjects and investigated the differences in hs-CRP among these 3 groups. The PD group was classified into 4 subgroups according to the Hoehn and Yahr stage to investigate the relationship between hs-CRP and symptom severity.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the hs-CRP value between the PD and the ischemic cerebrovascular disease groups, but the subjects in the 2 disease groups demonstrated higher hs-CRP levels than those in the normal control group. A post-hoc analysis of the 4 PD subgroups showed no significant differences in hs-CRP values. In addition, this study demonstrated that the odds ratio of the PD group by hs-CRP was 2.037 (95% CI 1.180-3.517; p = 0.011).

Approximately 90% of PD patients exhibit substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, which is stable over time and discriminates PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders. Since this TCS feature is also present in 9% of healthy adults aged 18-80 years, and is associated with a subclinical malfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, it is considered to be a risk marker for PD. SN hyperechogenicity is caused by increased amounts of iron, probably in abnormal protein bindings, and could be related in some cases to mutations of genes involved in iron metabolism. Influencing the disturbances of iron metabolism reflected by SN hyperechogenicity early in life might become a future therapeutic target for PD. Longitudinal studies currently assess the value of SN hyperechogenicity in combination with clinical and other neuroimaging findings in predicting an individual high risk of PD. TCS has the potential of a cost-effective, quick and mobile screening tool for risk populations within a stepwise diagnostic scheme to select individuals for upcoming neuroprotective therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between tHcy and holo-TC and the subsequent development of dementia and AD in a prospective study.
METHODS: A sub-sample of 228 non-demented subjects was taken from the Kungsholmen Project, a population-based longitudinal study amongst persons 75+ years. tHcy and holo-TC were analysed at baseline.

In controls, higher education was associated with greater white matter integrity in medial temporal lobe areas and association fiber tracts (p < 0.001). In multiple regression models, education was the main factor accounting for fiber tract integrity even when occupation was taken into account.

METHODS: We identified 151 consecutively recruited subjects with MCI from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Patient Registry who underwent MRI and 1H MRS studies at baseline and were followed up with approximately annual clinical examinations. A multivariable proportional hazards model that considered all imaging predictors simultaneously was used to determine whether hippocampal volumes, posterior cingulate gyrus 1H MRS metabolites, white matter hyperintensity load, and presence of cortical and subcortical infarctions are complementary in predicting the risk of progression from MCI to dementia.
RESULTS: Seventy-five subjects with MCI progressed to dementia by last follow-up. The model that best predicted progression to dementia included age, sex, hippocampal volumes, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) on 1H MRS, and cortical infarctions. Based on age- and sex-adjusted Kaplan-Meier plots, we estimated that by 3 years, 26% of the MCI patients with normal hippocampal volumes, NAA/Cr ratios >1 SD, and no cortical infarctions will progress to dementia, compared with 78% of the MCI patients with hippocampal atrophy, low NAA/Cr (< or =1 SD), and cortical infarction.

Haplotype sharing attempts to translate between population genetics and genetic epidemiology. Near a recent mutation that increases disease risk, haplotypes of case participants should be more similar to each other than haplotypes of control participants; conversely, the opposite pattern may be found near a recent mutation that lowers disease risk. We give computationally simple association tests based on haplotype sharing that can be easily applied to GWASs while allowing use of fast (but not likelihood-based) haplotyping algorithms and properly accounting for the uncertainty introduced by using inferred haplotypes. We also give haplotype-sharing analyses that adjust for population stratification.

It is not known whether subjects with narcolepsy (who frequently have associated RBD) also show SN hyperechogenicity. The aim of this study was to (1) evaluate SN echogenicity in narcolepsy and (2) determine whether transcranial sonography (TCS) differs in narcoleptic subjects with and without RBD. A total of 16 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (7 had a concomitant, video-polysomnographically based diagnosis of RBD) were examined with TCS by two investigators blinded to the clinical data. The size of the SN echogenic area in both subgroups was within the range previously described for healthy subjects. The brainstem raphe, however, was reduced in five of seven narcoleptic subjects with RBD, whereas only two of nine narcoleptic subjects without RBD exhibited this TCS finding.

,"19250756","Why do Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease target the same neurons?","Eggers AE","The puzzle is to explain how cerebral involvement in the sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) can target the same population of vulnerable neurons. These neurons are poorly-myelinated projection neurons, lack of myelin being associated with high metabolic demand, high oxygen consumption, and high baseline oxidative stress. Yet the two diseases are clearly separable, with different intracellular markers, different risk factors, and different patterns of subcortical involvement. A theory is developed to show how two different pathophysiologies can preferentially affect the same neurons. In the case of AD, the hypothesis is as follows: the so-called vascular risk factors of AD, which include hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, are all associated with increased systemic extracellular oxidative stress. High extracellular oxidative stress synergizes with high baseline intracellular oxidative stress to cause the disease. In the case of PD, mitochondrial failure associated with normal aging leads to diminished energy production and increased leakage of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria, a process which preferentially targets neurons with high baseline oxidative stress. In one case, the extra oxidative stress comes from outside the cell and, in the other case, it comes from inside the cell, i.e. from mitochondria. There is also evidence that neurofibrillary tangles are a protective mechanism against extracellular oxidative stress and that alpha-synuclein is a marker for mitochondrial failure. The basic pathophysiological difference is that AD is caused by oxidative stress alone, whereas PD is caused by oxidative stress plus failure of energy production.","2009",,"Med Hypotheses",,"other","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Animals, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Humans, FALSE, Models, Neurological, TRUE, Neurons, TRUE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Stroke, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Using linear regression analyses in a cross-sectional design, associations between PWV and age and the interaction of PWV and age were examined in relation to a global composite score, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Similarities test (abstract reasoning), and 4 cognitive domains indexed by multiple cognitive measures. Adjusting for age, gender, education, height, weight, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and antihypertensive treatment, PWV-by-age interactions were obtained for the global, visual-spatial organization and memory, scanning and tracking, and verbal episodic memory composites, as well as similarities. The combination of higher PWV and age resulted in progressively lower cognitive performance. This finding was the same with an extended model, which also included adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and other confounds.

Thus, we suggested that prenatal LPS exposure might represent as a risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report that the same exposure could lead to tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH, a serotonin neuron marker) immunoreactive cell loss in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Twenty two pups born to saline or LPS-injected gravid female rats at E10.5 were used in the current study. Twelve male pups at age of 4 months (6 from each of two prenatal groups) were used for the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) immunochemistry studies.

Significant DA and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reductions (P<0.05) were found in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The losses of DA and 5-HT were accompanied by the significant increases in homovanillic acid over DA and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid over 5-HT ratios in the most areas tested.

A prior review (Jackson, Gordon, Hart, Hopkins, & Ely, 2004), in which nine studies (total N = 1,885, years 1989-2003) were considered, concluded that there was evidence for an association between delirium and LTCI.

The studies show diverse sample sizes, methodologies, designs and patient populations. However, taken together, the results of these new studies broadly confirm that there is a link between delirium and LTCI. We go on to discuss putative mechanisms and explanations. These include (1) delirium as a marker of chronic progressive pathology, but unrelated to any progression, (2) delirium as a consequence of acute brain damage which is also responsible for a 'single hit' or triggering of active processes causing LTCI, (3) delirium itself as a cause of LTCI, and (4) drug treatment of delirium or other conditions as a cause of LTCI.

The clinical presentation associated with GRN mutations is heterogeneous and may include clinical probable Alzheimer's disease. All GRN mutations identified thus far cause disease through a uniform disease mechanism, i.e. the loss of functional GRN or haploinsufficiency. To determine if expression of GRN in plasma could predict GRN mutation status and could be used as a biological marker, we optimized a GRN ELISA and studied plasma samples of a consecutive clinical FTLD series of 219 patients, 70 control individuals, 72 early-onset probable Alzheimer's disease patients and nine symptomatic and 18 asymptomatic relatives of GRN mutation families. All FTLD patients with GRN loss-of-function mutations showed significantly reduced levels of GRN in plasma to about one third of the levels observed in non-GRN carriers and control individuals (P < 0.001). No overlap in distributions of GRN levels was observed between the eight GRN loss-of-function mutation carriers (range: 53-94 ng/ml) and 191 non-GRN mutation carriers (range: 115-386 ng/ml). Similar low levels of GRN were identified in asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers. Importantly, ELISA analyses also identified one probable Alzheimer's disease patient (1.4%) carrying a loss-of-function mutation in GRN. Biochemical analyses further showed that the GRN ELISA only detects full-length GRN, no intermediate granulin fragments. This study demonstrates that using a GRN ELISA in plasma, pathogenic GRN mutations can be accurately detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. The approximately 75% reduction in full-length GRN, suggests an unbalanced GRN metabolism in loss-of-function mutation carriers whereby more GRN is processed into granulins. We propose that plasma GRN levels could be used as a reliable and inexpensive tool to identify all GRN mutation carriers in early-onset dementia populations and asymptomatic at-risk individuals.","2009",,"Brain",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Family Health, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Heterozygote, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutation, TRUE, Progranulins, FALSE, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The primary objective was to investigate whether persistent depressive symptoms would relate to elevated platelet activation in response to acute psychological stress over a three-year period.
METHODS: Depressive symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory) were assessed among 99 spousal dementia caregivers (52-88 years). Platelet P-selectin expression was assessed in vivo using flow cytometry at three time-points over the course of an acute stress test: baseline, post-stress, and after 14 min of recovery. Two competing structural analytic models of depressive symptoms and platelet hyperactivity with three yearly assessments were compared.
RESULTS: Although depressive symptoms were generally in the subclinical range, their persistent elevation was associated with heightened platelet reactivity and recovery at all three-years while the change in depressive symptoms from the previous year did not predict platelet activity.
LIMITATIONS: These results focus on caregivers providing consistent home care, while future studies may extend these results by modeling major caregiving stressors.

METHOD: Auditory event-related potentials, P300 were recorded in 28 MCI patients (14 of them with normal CT/MRI findings and 10 subjects with mild ventricular enlargement). In another group of patients, 31 demented patients were examined, of whom 17 patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia (AD), and 14 patients with vascular dementia (VD). Forty healthy volunteers served as the control group.
RESULTS: Mean P300 latency was significantly increased for both demented patient-groups. We found that prolongation of P300 latency was correlated with the severity of dementia. Mean P300 amplitude was significantly decreased in both groups of demented patients. In MCI, the mean latency of P300 was significantly longer among patients with mild cerebral atrophy compared to control volunteers and no significant changes were found for MCI patients with normal CT/MRI findings. Mean P300 amplitude was decreased only in demented patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The prolongation of P300 latency was significant among patients with both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia, and also among MCI patients with mild cerebral atrophy. The severity of dementia is positively correlated with P300 latency; however, this prolongation is independent of the type of dementia.

However, the long-term risk of developing neurodegeneration in patients with idiopathic RBD has not been established. Obtaining an accurate picture of this risk is essential for counseling patients and for development of potential neuroprotective therapies.
METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study of all patients seen at the sleep disorders laboratory at the Hôpital du Sacré Coeur with a diagnosis of idiopathic RBD. Diagnoses of parkinsonism and dementia were defined according to standard criteria. Survival curves were constructed to estimate the 5-, 10-, and 12-year risk of developing neurodegenerative disease.
RESULTS: Of 113 patients, 93 (82%) met inclusion criteria. The mean age of participants was 65.4 years and 75 patients (80.4%) were men. Over the follow-up period, 26/93 patients developed a neurodegenerative disorder. A total of 14 patients developed PD, 7 developed Lewy body dementia, 4 developed dementia that met clinical criteria for AD, and 1 developed multiple system atrophy. The estimated 5-year risk of neurodegenerative disease was 17.7%, the 10-year risk was 40.6%, and the 12-year risk was 52.4%.

In the process of attempting to identify novel genetic factors associated with PD, scientists have generated many lists of candidate genes, polymorphisms, and proteins that represent important advances, but these leads remain mechanistically undefined. Our work is aimed toward significantly narrowing such lists by exploiting the advantages of a simple animal model system. While humans have billions of neurons, the microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has precisely 302, of which only eight produce dopamine (DA) in hemaphrodites. Expression of a human gene encoding the PD-associated protein, alpha-synuclein, in C. elegans DA neurons results in dosage and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Worms expressing human alpha-synuclein in DA neurons are isogenic and express both GFP and human alpha-synuclein under the DA transporter promoter (Pdat-1). The presence of GFP serves as a readily visualized marker for following DA neurodegeneration in these animals. We initially demonstrated that alpha-synuclein-induced DA neurodegeneration could be rescued in these animals by torsinA, a protein with molecular chaperone activity. Further, candidate PD-related genes identified in our lab via large-scale RNAi screening efforts using an alpha-synuclein misfolding assay were then over-expressed in C. elegans DA neurons. We determined that five of seven genes tested represented significant candidate modulators of PD as they rescued alpha-synuclein-induced DA neurodegeneration. Additionally, the Lindquist Lab (this issue of JoVE) has performed yeast screens whereby alpha-synuclein-dependent toxicity is used as a readout for genes that can enhance or suppress cytotoxicity. We subsequently examined the yeast candidate genes in our C. elegans alpha-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration assay and successfully validated many of these targets. Our methodology involves generation of a C. elegans DA neuron-specific expression vector using recombinational cloning of candidate gene cDNAs under control of the Pdat-1 promoter. These plasmids are then microinjected in wild-type (N2) worms, along with a selectable marker for successful transformation. Multiple stable transgenic lines producing the candidate protein in DA neurons are obtained and then independently crossed into the alpha-synuclein degenerative strain and assessed for neurodegeneration, at both the animal and individual neuron level, over the course of aging.","2008",,"J Vis Exp"," Our work is aimed toward significantly narrowing such lists by exploiting the advantages of a simple animal model system ","other","Animals, FALSE, Animals, Genetically Modified, FALSE, Caenorhabditis elegans, FALSE, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Dopamine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Genetic Vectors, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Cognitive abilities were assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a composite score of executive and attention functioning (CCS) at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: In MA patients (n=80), increased UAERs correlated with intimal media thickness (IMT) (r=0.268; p=02) and PWV (r=0.310; p=004). In the same group, increased UAERs were correlated with MMSE and CCS even after adjusting for age and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). After adding PWV, the associations among UAERs, MMSE, and CCS were no longer significant. In MA patients, PWV correlated with IMT, MMSE, and CCS. In NA patients, no significant correlations were found among UAERs, MMSE, and CCS. At follow-up, baseline UAERs predicted an approximately 20% risk of poor cognition (according to MMSE and CCS) after adjusting for confounders. After adding PWV, UAERs no longer predicted cognitive performance.

METHODS: Serum cystatin C levels were analyzed at two examinations of the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men, a longitudinal, community-based study of elderly men (age 70 years, n = 1,153 and age 77 years, n = 761, a subset of the age 70 examination). Cox regressions were used to examine associations between serum cystatin C and incident AD. AD cases were identified by cognitive screening and comprehensive medical chart review in all subjects.
RESULTS: On follow-up (median 11.3 years), 82 subjects developed AD. At age 70 years, lower cystatin C was associated with higher risk of AD independently of age, APOE4 genotype, glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cholesterol, body mass index, smoking, education level, and plasma amyloid-beta protein 40 and 42 levels (hazard ratio [HR] for lowest [<1.12 micromol/L] vs highest [>1.30 micromol/L] tertile = 2.67, 95% CI 1.22-5.83, p < 0.02). The results were similar at age 77 years (43 participants developed AD during follow-up). Furthermore, a 0.1-mumol/L decrease of cystatin C between ages 70 and 77 years was associated with a 29% higher risk of incident AD (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03-1.63, p < 0.03).

Thus, it is critical to identify biomarkers of preclinical disease, allowing targeting of high-risk subjects for preventive efforts. Since telomeres shorten with age and oxidative stress, both of which are important contributors to the onset of dementia, telomere length might be a valuable biomarker.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 62 participants of the Nurses' Health Study, we conducted neurologic evaluations, including patient and caregiver interviews, physical exam, neurologic exam, and neuropsychologic testing. We also conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a sample of 29 of these women. In these preliminary data, after adjustment for numerous health and lifestyle factors, we found that truncated telomeres in peripheral blood leukocytes segregate with preclinical dementia states, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI); the odds of MCI were 12-fold higher (odds ratio = 12.00, 95% confidence interval 1.24-116.5) for those with shorter telomere length compared to longer telomere length. In addition, decreasing telomere length was strongly related to decreasing hippocampal volume (p = 0.038).

Dementia-related gait changes (DRGC) mainly include decrease in walking speed provoked by a decrease in stride length and an increase in support phase. More recently, dual-task related changes in gait were found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-Alzheimer dementia, even at an early stage. An increase in stride-to-stride variability while usual walking and dual-tasking has been shown to be more specific and sensitive than any change in mean value in subjects with dementia. Those data show that DRGC are not only associated to motor disorders but also to problem with central processing of information and highlight that dysfunction of temporal and frontal lobe may in part explain gait impairment among demented subjects. Gait assessment, and more particularly dual-task analysis, is therefore crucial in early diagnosis of dementia and/or related syndromes in the elderly.

With an aging world population, the prevalence of dementia will increase dramatically in the next few decades. Of the predicted 114 million who will have dementia in 2050, about three-quarters will live in less developed regions. Although strongly age-related, dementia is not an inevitable part of aging but is a true disease, caused by exposure to several genetic and nongenetic risk factors. Prevention will be possible when the nongenetic risk factors have been identified. Apart from age, more than 20 nongenetic risk factors have been postulated, but very few have been established by randomized intervention studies. Elevated blood concentrations of total homocysteine and low-normal concentrations of B vitamins (folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6) are candidate risk factors for both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Seventy-seven cross-sectional studies on more than 34,000 subjects and 33 prospective studies on more than 12,000 subjects have shown associations between cognitive deficit or dementia and homocysteine and/or B vitamins. Biologically plausible mechanisms have been proposed to account for these associations, including atrophy of the cerebral cortex, but a definite causal pathway has yet to be shown. Raised plasma total homocysteine is a strong prognostic marker of future cognitive decline, and is common in world populations. Low-normal concentrations of the B vitamins, the main determinant of homocysteine concentrations, are also common and occur in particularly vulnerable sections of the population, such as infants and elderly. Large-scale randomized trials of homocysteine-lowering vitamins are needed to see if a proportion of dementia in the world can be prevented.","2008",,"Food Nutr Bull",," review","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, TRUE, blood, Q000097, Dementia, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Environment, FALSE, Folic Acid, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Homocysteine, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, Hyperhomocysteinemia, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Risk Factors, FALSE, Vitamin B 12, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Vitamin B Complex, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Data from a number of laboratories suggest that mild elevations of homocysteine in plasma are a risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. In the Framingham studies, we have shown that plasma homocysteine concentration is inversely related to the intake and plasma levels of folate and vitamin B6 as well as vitamin B12 plasma levels. Almost two-thirds of the prevalence of high homocysteine is attributable to low vitamin status or intake. Elevated homocysteine concentrations in plasma are a risk factor for prevalence of extracranial carotid-artery stenosis > or = 25% in both men and women. Prospectively elevated plasma homocysteine is associated with increased total and cardiovascular mortality, increased incidence of stroke, increased incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, increased incidence of bone fracture, and higher prevalence of chronic heart failure. It was also shown that elevated plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for preeclampsia and maybe neural tube defects (NTD). This multitude of relationships between elevated plasma homocysteine and diseases that afflict the elderly, pregnant women, and the embryo points to the existence ofa common denominator which may be responsible for these diseases.

Recent research focused on the protection of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into dementia and the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A combination of Abeta42 and t-tau in CSF can discriminate between patients with stable MCI and patients with progressive MCI into AD or other types of dementia with a sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Regression analyses demonstrated that pathological CSF (with decreased Abeta42 and and increased tau levels) is a very strong predictor for the progression of MCI into AD. Furthermore, CSF measurements of p-tau and Abeta42 can assist in diagnosing vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia in the differential diagnosis of AD indicated by a reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Whether tau in combination with Abeta42 or in combination with the Abeta37/Abeta42 or Abeta38/Abeta42 ratio aids in the discrimination between AD and Lewy Body dementia remains to be elucidated. Cross-sectional research could not demonstrate significant differences for Abeta40 and Abeta42 in plasma between AD and controls. However, a recently published longitudinal study showed high baseline Abeta40 levels, especially when combined with low baseline Abeta 42 levels, are a strong risk factor for the development of dementia. This emphasizes the importance of performing longitudinal studies in addition to cross-sectional ones. The origin of plasma Abeta and its transport between CSF and plasma, however, needs further clarification. In conclusion, progress has been made regarding Abeta and tau as biomarkers for dementia, both for differentiation between stable MCI and progressive MCI patients and for the differential diagnosis of AD. Future research should aim to validate these recently published results, preferably in pathologically confirmed AD patients. In addition, it is important to standardise research in terms of study design (longitudinal, minimal follow-up period of 5 years), type of researched parameters ( total or p-tau, type of Abeta peptides), type of matrix (CSF and plasma) and data analysis (establishment of predefined cut-off values, type of ratio, type of marker combination).","2008",,"Curr Clin Pharmacol"," Future research should aim to validate these recently published results , preferably in pathologically confirmed AD patients "," review","Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biomarkers, FALSE, Dementia, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE, blood, Q000097",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"18631949","Core candidate neurochemical and imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.","Hampel H","BACKGROUND: In the earliest clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) when symptoms are mild, clinical diagnosis can be difficult. AD pathology most likely precedes symptoms. Biomarkers can serve as early diagnostic indicators or as markers of preclinical pathologic change. Candidate biomarkers derived from structural and functional neuroimaging and those measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma show the greatest promise. Unbiased exploratory approaches, eg, proteomics or cortical thickness analysis, could yield novel biomarkers. The objective of this article was to review recent progress in selected imaging and neurochemical biomarkers for early diagnosis, classification, progression, and prediction of AD.
METHODS: We performed a survey of recent research, focusing on core biomarker candidates in AD.
RESULTS: A number of in vivo neurochemistry and neuroimaging techniques, which can reliably assess aspects of physiology, pathology, chemistry, and neuroanatomy, hold promise as biomarkers. These neurobiologic measures appear to relate closely to pathophysiologic, neuropathologic, and clinical data, such as hyperphosphorylation of tau, amyloid beta (Abeta) metabolism, lipid peroxidation, pattern and rate of atrophy, loss of neuronal integrity, functional and cognitive decline, as well as risk of future decline. Current advances in the neuroimaging of mediotemporal, neocortical, and subcortical areas of the brain of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects are presented. CSF levels of Abeta42, tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) can distinguish subjects with MCI who are likely to progress to AD. They also show preclinical alterations that predict later development of early AD symptoms. Studies on plasma Abeta are not entirely consistent, but recent findings suggest that decreased plasma Abeta42 relative to Abeta40 might increase the risk of AD. Increased production of Abeta in aging is suggested by elevation of BACE1 protein and enzyme activity in the brain and CSF of subjects with MCI. CSF tau and p-tau are increased in MCI as well and show predictive value. Other biomarkers might indicate components of a cascade initiated by Abeta, such as oxidative stress or inflammation. These merit further study in MCI and earlier.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of neuroimaging candidate markers are promising, such as hippocampus and entorhinal cortex volumes, basal forebrain nuclei, cortical thickness, deformation-based and voxel-based morphometry, structural and effective connectivity by using diffusion tensor imaging, tractography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. CSF Abeta42, BACE1, total tau, and p-tau are substantially altered in MCI and clinical AD. Other interesting novel marker candidates derived from blood are being currently proposed (phase I). Biomarker discovery through proteomic approaches requires further research. Large-scale international controlled multicenter trials (such as the U.S., European, Australian, and Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the German Dementia Network) are engaged in phase III development of the core feasible imaging and CSF biomarker candidates in AD.

Statistical models including multiple variants in axon guidance pathway genes have recently been purported to be capable of predicting PD risk, survival free of the disease and age at disease onset; however the specific models have not undergone independent validation. Here we tested the best proposed risk panel of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two PD sample sets, with a total of 525 cases and 518 controls. By single marker analysis, only one marker was significantly associated with PD risk in one of our sample sets (rs6692804: P = 0.03).

Following a procedure similar to that used to build the reported model, simulated multi-marker models containing SNPs from randomly chosen genes in a genome wide PD dataset produced P-values that were highly significant and indistinguishable from similar models where disease status was permuted (3.13x10(-23) to 4.90x10(-64)), demonstrating the potential for overfitting in the model building process.

Examining age-related and region-specific differences in DA neurons represents a means of identifying factors potentially involved in vulnerability or resistance to degeneration. Nitrative stress is among the factors potentially underlying DA neuron degeneration. We studied the relationship between 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT; a marker of nitrative damage) and DA transporters [DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT)] during aging in DA subregions of rhesus monkeys. The percentage of DA neurons containing 3NT increased significantly only in the vtSN with advancing age, and the vtSN had a greater percentage of 3NT-positive neurons when compared to the VTA. The relationship between 3NT and DA transporters was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity of 3NT, DAT and VMAT staining. 3NT intensity increased with advancing age in the vtSN. Increased DAT, VMAT and DAT/VMAT ratios were associated with increased 3NT in individual DA neurons. These results suggest nitrative damage accumulates in midbrain DA neurons with advancing age, an effect exacerbated in the vulnerable vtSN. The capacity of a DA neuron to accumulate more cytosolic DA, as inferred from DA transporter expression, is related to accumulation of nitrative damage. These findings are consistent with a role for aging-related accrual of nitrative damage in the selective vulnerability of vtSN neurons to degeneration in PD.","2008",,"Eur J Neurosci"," We studied the relationship between 3-nitrotyrosine ( 3NT ; a marker of nitrative damage ) and DA transporters [ DA transporter ( DAT ) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 ( VMAT ) ] during aging in DA subregions of rhesus monkeys ","other","Aging, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Animals, FALSE, Cytosol, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Fluorescent Antibody Technique, FALSE, Immunohistochemistry, FALSE, Macaca mulatta, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Tyrosine, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Ventral Tegmental Area, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

PURPOSE: The purpose of this SBU project was to use systematic database searches and a review of the scientific literature as a starting point to assess the current state of knowledge about dementia disorders from various perspectives. Those perspectives included occurrence, risk factors for development, diagnostics, care, ethical considerations, ethnicity and drug therapies, as well as the health economic aspects.
OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT: The objective of the report is to: Analyse current knowledge and values about caregiving in order to help caregivers of dementia patients. Support nurses and caregivers in diagnosing and treating people with dementia disorders. Describe the key role of family members in caring for people with dementia. Provide public officials and other decision makers with a scientific basis for formulating dementia care policy.
SBU’S CONCLUSIONS: OCCURRENCE, RISK AND PREVENTION: Two thirds of the approximately 140,000 Swedes with a dementia disorder have Alzheimer’s disease. The other two leading disorders are vascular dementia (10%) and frontotemporal dementia (5%). Other disorders occur in various combinations with non-dementia conditions, such as the frequent comorbidity of Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease. A common denominator of all dementia disorders is that memory and cognitive function is impaired due to neuron death. Age is the primary risk factor for developing dementia (strong scientific evidence). Rising life expectancies are increasing the number of people who develop dementia disorders. Approximately 1% of 65-year-olds and more than 50% of 90-year-olds have a dementia disorder. Among people older than 85, a greater percentage of women than men have Alzheimer’s disease (moderately strong scientific evidence). Although known genetic changes that cause Alzheimer’s disease are rare, the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 allele is known to increase the risk (strong scientific evidence). Currently, there is no specific preventive treatment for dementia, but blood pressure monitoring in middle age reduces the risk of developing it later in life (moderately strong scientific evidence). Treatment with antihypertensives reduces the risk of developing vascular dementia later in life (moderately strong scientific evidence). The progression of dementia can be delayed among older people who continue to lead active lives (moderately strong scientific evidence). RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DISEASES: Cognitive deterioration due to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism is unrelated to dementia but needs to be diagnosed and treated. Existing studies show contradictory results with respect to the cor- relation between low vitamin B
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH NEEDS: Additional research on dementia disorders is required in several areas: How the various disorders progress. Development of diagnostic methods. Better evaluation of instruments for identifying and measuring cognitive and related symptoms, as well as assessing the quality of life of people with dementia. Development of caregiving methods, such as guidance, training and studies that focus on the relationship between patient and caregiver. Clearer ethical guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and care of people with dementia. Drugs for all categories of dementia that are more effective and cause fewer adverse effects.

DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: The Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347 Trial (PRECEPT) study, which investigated the effects of a potential neuroprotectant on rates of PD progression, was conducted between April 2002 and August 2005 (average follow-up time 21.4 months).
PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred four subjects with early PD enrolled in the PRECEPT study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary study end point was progression to clinical disability sufficient to warrant dopaminergic therapy. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of reaching end point according to quintiles of baseline serum urate concentration, adjusting for sex, age, and other potential covariates. Change in striatal uptake of iodine I 123-labeled 2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)I]beta-CIT), a marker for the presynaptic dopamine transporter, was assessed with linear regression for a subset of 399 subjects.
RESULTS: The adjusted HR of reaching end point declined with increasing baseline concentrations of urate; subjects in the top quintile reached the end point at only half the rate of subjects in the bottom quintile (HR, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.72; P for trend < .001). This association was markedly stronger in men (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.60; P for trend < .001) than in women (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.39-1.50; P for trend = .33). The percentage of loss in striatal [(123)I]beta-CIT uptake also improved with increasing serum urate concentrations (overall P for trend = .002; men, P = .001; women, P = .43).

RESULTS: After adjustment for age and sex, greater body mass indices (BMIs) correlated with: (1) lower concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (spectroscopic marker of neuronal viability) in frontal (p = 0.001), parietal (p = 0.006), and temporal (p = 0.008) white matter; (2) lower N-acetylaspartate in frontal gray matter (p = 0.01); and (3) lower concentrations of choline-containing metabolites (associated with membrane metabolism) in frontal white matter (p = 0.05).
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that increased BMI at midlife is associated with neuronal and/or myelin abnormalities, primarily in the frontal lobe. Because white matter in the frontal lobes is more prone to the effects of aging than in other lobes, our results may reflect accelerated aging in individuals with high levels of adiposity. Thus, greater BMI may increase the odds of developing an age-related disease, such as Alzheimer's disease.","2008",,"Ann Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : Obesity and being overweight during adulthood have been consistently linked to increased risk for development of dementia later in life , especially Alzheimer's disease ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aspartic Acid, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Biomarkers, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Body Mass Index, TRUE, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Myelin Sheath, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Statistics as Topic, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The present review aims to offer a general view of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and to discuss their relevance and limitations.
RECENT FINDINGS: The broad overlap in the plasma amyloid beta protein (Abeta) levels between patients with Alzheimer's disease and control individuals indicates that the plasma Abeta level cannot differentiate cases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease from control cases. Although the significance of Abeta for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease is controversial, high plasma concentrations of Abeta40 and low plasma concentrations of Abeta42 indicate an increased risk of dementia.
SUMMARY: The usefulness of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid has been shown by numerous studies; this test is not commonly used, however, and blood biomarkers are therefore preferred. Increasing evidence shows that the plasma Abeta concentration may be a premorbid marker for the risk of Alzheimer's disease. It may be used for therapeutic monitoring, diagnosis of Abeta deposition in the brain, and also as a surrogate genetic marker to identify novel genetic determinants of Alzheimer's disease. A potential role of plasma Abeta concentration as a marker of incipient dementia warrants further investigation.","2008",,"Curr Opin Psychiatry"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The importance of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease is increasing "," review","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Peptide Fragments, FALSE, blood, Q000097",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

With the discovery of missense and multiplication mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) in familial parkinsonism, Lewy inclusions were found to stain intensely with antibodies raised against the protein. Yeast-two-hybrid studies identified synphilin-1 as an interacting partner of alpha-synuclein, and both proteins show co-immunolocalization in a subset of Lewy body inclusions. In the present study, we have investigated whether common variability in synphilin-1, including coding substitutions are genetically associated with disease pathogenesis.
METHODS: We screened the synphilin-1 gene for 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 300 affected subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 412 healthy controls. Six of these were rare variants including five previously identified amino acid substitutions that were chosen in a direct approach for association of rare disease causing mutations. An additional five highly heterozygous SNPs were chosen for an indirect association approach including haplotype analysis, based on the assumption that any disease causing mutations might be in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs selected. We also genotyped a microsatellite marker (D5S2950) within intron 6 of the gene and five additional microsatellites clustered downstream of the 5p23.1-23.3 synphilin-1 locus. Genome-wide linkage analysis, in a number of independent studies, has previously highlighted suggestive linkage to PD in this region of chromosome 5.
RESULTS: Screening of previously known amino acid substitutions in the synphilin-1 gene, identified the C1861>T (R621C) substitution in four patients (chromosomes n = 600) and 10 control subjects (chromosomes n = 824), whereas the G2125>C (E706Q) substitution was detected in one patient and four control subject, suggesting both these substitutions are not associated with susceptibility to PD. Heterozygous non-synonymous T131>C (V44A) and synonymous C636>T (P212P) amino acid substitutions were each detected in only one patient with PD. Heterozygous C1134>T (L378L) synonymous substitutions were found in two patients with PD and one control subject. D5S2010 the most distal telomeric microsatellite marker genotyped,15.3 Mb from synphilin-1, was genetically associated with PD (p = 0.006, 27df) independently adjusted for multiple testing according to its high amount of alleles but not the total number of other markers investigated. Other flanking and intronic SNP and microsatellite markers showed no evidence for genetic association with disease.
CONCLUSION: In this study rare synphilin-1 SNPs were assessed in a direct association approach to identify amino acid substitutions that might confer risk of PD in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state. We found none of these rare variations were associated with disease. In contrast to prior studies the frequency of the R621C substitution was not significantly different between PD and control subjects, neither were the V44A or E706Q substitutions. Similarly, our indirect study of more heterozygous SNPs, including both single marker and haplotype analyses, showed no significant association to PD. However, marginal association of microsatellite alleles with idiopathic PD, within the chromosome 5q21 region, indicates further studies are warranted.","2008",,"BMC Med Genet",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Carrier Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gene Frequency, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Genetic Variation, TRUE, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Microsatellite Repeats, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Metabolic differences have been observed in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies comparing patients with PDD to nondemented PD patients, although it is unclear whether PDD patients have abnormally low MRS ratios compared with healthy age-matched adults. In this study, 12 patients with PDD, 12 patients with PD and no dementia, and 12 age-matched healthy older adults underwent MRS of the posterior cingulate gyrus. Patients with PDD showed lower N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) compared with controls (P=0.004) and compared with nondemented PD patients (P=0.003). No abnormalities were observed in choline/Cr or myo-Inositol/Cr. NAA/Cr was correlated with mental status in patients with PD and in patients with PDD (r=0.56; P=0.029).

In view of the temporal profile of Alzheimer disease, it is essential to detect at-risk people who carry senile plaques (amyloid) but are cognitively normal. Even in MCI more than 50% of neurons in layer 2 is already lost. For such very early detection of at-risk people biomaker would be helpful.

Cocaine, one of the most widely abused drugs in the United States, can both impair the functions of macrophages and CD4(+) lymphocytes and also activate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 expression in these cells. Because the brain is the target organ for both cocaine and HIV, the objective of the present study was to explore the effects of cocaine on virus replication in macrophages, the target cells for the virus in the central nervous system (CNS). Cocaine markedly enhanced virus production in simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and in U1 cells, a chronically infected promonocytic cell line as monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunocytochemistry. Cocaine treatment also resulted in the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and transcriptional activation of the HIV-LTR (long terminal repeat) gag-GFP (green fluorescent protein). Analyses of chemokines in cocaine-treated macrophages by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Luminex assays suggested increased expression of interleukin (IL)-10, a cytokine that is known to promote HIV replication in MDMs. In addition to enhancing IL-10 expression, cocaine also caused an up-regulation of the macrophage activation marker, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, in MDMs. The synergistic effect of cocaine on virus replication and its enhancement of host activation markers suggest that cocaine functions at multiple pathways to accelerate HIV-associated dementia (HAD).","2007",,"J Neurovirol"," Because the brain is the target organ for both cocaine and HIV , the objective of the present study was to explore the effects of cocaine on virus replication in macrophages , the target cells for the virus in the central nervous system ( CNS ) ","other","AIDS Dementia Complex, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Cocaine, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, FALSE, Green Fluorescent Proteins, FALSE, HIV, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, HIV Infections, FALSE, complications, Q000150, HIV Long Terminal Repeat, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Macaca mulatta, FALSE, Macrophages, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Virus Replication, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The results of epidemiological studies are inconsistent in showing an association between elevated homocysteine levels and dementia or Alzheimer disease. Although prospective studies show a trend towards a benefit of homocysteine-related B vitamin substitution, consistent data are expected from upcoming clinical intervention trials. Data from recent clinical randomized trials including various cognitive tests, different aging groups and supplements in different doses are not sufficient to allow recommendation of homocysteine-reducing therapy with folate or vitamin B12 substitution. According to the published data it remains to be proven whether a reduction in homocysteine will improve cognitive performance.

Hypomethylation, caused by low B-vitamin status and HHcy, is linked to key pathomechanisms of dementia; B-vitamin supplementation could potentially reduce neurological damage. In retrospective studies, the association between tHcy and cognition is impressive; there is also evidence that tHcy-lowering treatment could be effective in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Increased tHcy and low serum folate occur in patients with Parkinson's disease, especially those receiving L-dopa. There is also an association between HHcy and multiple sclerosis, and between B-vitamin status and depression. Studies also confirm a causal role for tHcy in epilepsy, and certain anti-epileptics enhance HHcy. B-vitamin status should be optimized by ensuring sufficient intake in patients with neuropsychiatric diseases. HHcy occurs commonly in the elderly and can contribute to age-related neurodegeneration.

Most of the published epidemiological studies are consistent with a positive association between high reported DHA consumption or high DHA blood levels and a lower risk of developing AD later in life. Such observations have prompted the investigation of DHA in three different transgenic models of AD. These analyses show that animal models of AD are more vulnerable to DHA depletion than controls and that DHA exerts a beneficial effect against pathological signs of AD, including A beta accumulation, cognitive impairment, synaptic marker loss, and hyperphosphorylation of tau. Multiple mechanisms of action can be associated with the neuroprotective effects of DHA and include antioxidant properties and activation of distinct cell signaling pathways.

It is non-invasive, widely available, low-cost and could be carried out rapidly in the high-risk age group that will develop AD.

The hypothesis is that the information theoretic makers for AD are significantly different to those of normal subjects. An attraction of the information theoretic approach is that, unlike most existing methods, there may be a natural link between the underlying ideas of information theoretic methods, the physiology of AD and its impact on brain functions. Data compression has not been investigated as a means of generating EEG markers before and is attractive because it does not require a priori knowledge of the source model.

The enzyme substrate, glucocerebroside, accumulates in the body, predominantly in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Osteoarticular manifestations are often inaugural and contribute much of the morbidity and disability associated with Gaucher disease. There are three types of Gaucher disease. The most common is type 1, which can produce a broad range of presentations characterized by cytopenia and involvement of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Types 2 and 3 are rarest variants that manifest in infancy and cause neurologic damages. Patients with type 2 Gaucher disease usually die before 2years of age. beta-glucocerebrosidase assays and examination of bone marrow smears and biopsies ensure the diagnosis. Specific mutations in the beta-glucocerebrosidase gene are associated with specific clinical presentations: thus, the N370S mutation (heterozygous or homozygous) confers type 1 disease and the L444P mutation neurologic involvement and type 3 disease. Bone involvement is a feature in 70%-100% of cases. Abnormal bone remodeling, osteonecrosis and bony infarcts, osteopenia with fractures, and more rarely infections may occur. The other manifestations are dominated by cytopenia (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anemia), hypersplenism, and liver enlargement. The risk of myeloma is increased. Parkinson-like syndromes were recently described in patients with type 1 disease. The enzyme chitotriosidase can be assayed to quantify the degree of macrophage activation. The chemokine CCL18 is another valuable marker but is not readily available in everyday practice. The treatment of Gaucher disease includes symptomatic drugs to relieve pain. Splenectomy is rarely necessary now that specific treatments are available. Enzyme replacement therapy (imiglucerase) has considerably improved the management of the highest risk patients.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of cognitive decline with vitamin B-12 and folate status in a longitudinal cohort study performed from 1993 to 2003 in Oxford, United Kingdom.
DESIGN: Cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination on >/=3 occasions during 10 y and related to serum concentrations of vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin (holoTC), tHcy, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and folate with the use of linear mixed models in 1648 participants who provided blood in 1995.
RESULTS: Cognitive function declined abruptly at younger ages in some participants but remained intact in others until very old age. In multivariate regression analyses after adjustment for established risk factors, concentrations of holoTC (a marker of reduced vitamin B-12 status), tHcy, and MMA predicted cognitive decline, but folate did not. A doubling in holoTC concentrations (from 50 to 100 pmol/L) was associated with a 30% slower rate of cognitive decline (-0.137 to -0.083), whereas a doubling in tHcy (from 10 to 20 micromol/L) or MMA (from 0.25 to 0.50 micromol/L) was associated with >50% more rapid cognitive decline (-0.090 to -0.169) and (-0.104 to -0.169), respectively. After adjustment for all vitamin markers simultaneously, the associations of cognitive decline with holoTC and MMA remained significant.

,"17962588","Chronic kidney disease is associated with white matter hyperintensity volume: the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS).","Khatri M","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities have been associated with increased risk of stroke, cognitive decline, and dementia. Chronic kidney disease is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been associated with inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of white matter hyperintensities. Few studies have explored the relationship between chronic kidney disease and white matter hyperintensities.
METHODS: The Northern Manhattan Study is a prospective, community-based cohort of which a subset of stroke-free participants underwent MRIs. MRIs were analyzed quantitatively for white matter hyperintensities volume, which was log-transformed to yield a normal distribution (log-white matter hyperintensity volume). Kidney function was modeled using serum creatinine, the Cockcroft-Gault formula for creatinine clearance, and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula for estimated glomerular filtration rate. Creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate were trichotomized to 15 to 60 mL/min, 60 to 90 mL/min, and >90 mL/min (reference). Linear regression was used to measure the association between kidney function and log-white matter hyperintensity volume adjusting for age, gender, race-ethnicity, education, cardiac disease, diabetes, homocysteine, and hypertension.
RESULTS: Baseline data were available on 615 subjects (mean age 70 years, 60% women, 18% whites, 21% blacks, 62% Hispanics). In multivariate analysis, creatinine clearance 15 to 60 mL/min was associated with increased log-white matter hyperintensity volume (beta 0.322; 95% CI, 0.095 to 0.550) as was estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 to 60 mL/min (beta 0.322; 95% CI, 0.080 to 0.564). Serum creatinine, per 1-mg/dL increase, was also positively associated with log-white matter hyperintensity volume (beta 1.479; 95% CI, 1.067 to 2.050).

Carryover effects were also evaluated. During usual walking, variability was significantly higher (worse) in the patients with PD compared with the controls (P < 0.01). For the patients with PD, RAS at 100% improved gait speed, stride length and swing time (P < 0.02) but did not significantly affect variability. With RAS at 110%, reductions in variability were also observed (P < 0.03) and these effects persisted 2 and 15 min later. In the control subjects, the positive effects of RAS were not observed. For example, RAS increased stride time variability at 100 and 110%. These results demonstrate that RAS enables more automatic movement and reduces stride-to-stride variability in patients with PD. Further, these improvements are not simply a by-product of changes in speed or stride length.

We aim to study the PGRN expression variability in patients with different clinical features for a better understanding of its roles in FTLD disease.
METHODS: We sequenced the PGRN gene in 72 patients suffering from FTLD (25 familial and 47 sporadic cases) and in 24 asymptomatic at-risk relatives. We also analyzed PGRN expression in blood by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction from 37 patients, 8 asymptomatic mutation carriers, and 10 control subjects as well as in brain tissue from 16 patients and 9 control subjects.
RESULTS: Four novel mutations were associated with familial and sporadic FTLD and familial dementia associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We identified a close association between the IVS6-1G>A mutation in PGRN and corticobasal syndrome. Brain tissue was available for carriers of two of the four mutations (IVS6-1 G>A and P357HfsX3). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed ubiquitin- and TDP-43positive and tau/alpha-synuclein negative immunoreactive neuronal intranuclear inclusions. The relative expression of PGRN in the clinical sample was significantly lower in carriers of the IVS6-1 G>A than in control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Progranulopathies are a major cause of the main phenotypes included in the FTLD complex.

We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) and linkage analysis exploring the genetic basis of these endophenotypes in a community-based sample.
METHODS: A total of 705 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham participants (age 62 +9 yrs, 50% male) who underwent volumetric brain MRI and cognitive testing (1999-2002) were genotyped. We used linear models adjusting for first degree relationships via generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family based association tests (FBAT) in additive models to relate qualifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, 70,987 autosomal on Affymetrix 100K Human Gene Chip with minor allele frequency > or = 0.10, genotypic call rate > or = 0.80, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value > or = 0.001) to multivariable-adjusted residuals of 9 MRI measures including total cerebral brain (TCBV), lobar, ventricular and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and 6 cognitive factors/tests assessing verbal and visuospatial memory, visual scanning and motor speed, reading, abstract reasoning and naming. We determined multipoint identity-by-descent utilizing 10,592 informative SNPs and 613 short tandem repeats and used variance component analyses to compute LOD scores.
RESULTS: The strongest gene-phenotype association in FBAT analyses was between SORL1 (rs1131497; p = 3.2 x 10(-6)) and abstract reasoning, and in GEE analyses between CDH4 (rs1970546; p = 3.7 x 10(-8)) and TCBV. SORL1 plays a role in amyloid precursor protein processing and has been associated with the risk of AD. Among the 50 strongest associations (25 each by GEE and FBAT) were other biologically interesting genes. Polymorphisms within 28 of 163 candidate genes for stroke, AD and memory impairment were associated with the endophenotypes studied at p < 0.001. We confirmed our previously reported linkage of WMH on chromosome 4 and describe linkage of reading performance to a marker on chromosome 18 (GATA11A06), previously linked to dyslexia (LOD scores = 2.2 and 5.1).

BACKGROUND: The inability to taste PTC has been associated with a number of medical illnesses not typically associated with taste impairment. Abnormalities in the function/expression of G protein-signaling pathways have been implicated in PTC perception and also in dopamine expression and regulation in PD. No study has yet probed whether PTC tasting is disrupted in PD.
METHOD: PTC sensitivity was assessed in a small sample of 36 male PD patients and 20 healthy male comparison subjects using a standardized psychophysical method.
RESULTS: A higher proportion of nontasters were found in patients relative to healthy comparison subjects. These differences were not explained by alterations in perception of basic taste intensity or age. Among patients, nontasters and tasters of PTC did not differ with regard to duration of illness, age of onset, severity of motor symptoms, or overall illness severity.

The authors performed magnetic resonance spectroscopic and neuropsychological evaluations on 61 patients with AIDS dementia complex (stages 1-3) and 39 HIV-positive neurologically asymptomatic individuals. N-acetylaspartate, a marker of mature neurons, choline and myoinositol, both markers of gliosis, and creatine, a reference marker, were measured in the basal ganglia, frontal white matter, and parietal cortex. The neuropsychological evaluation consisted of tests that measured gross and fine motor skills, psychomotor function, information processing speed, and verbal memory. The authors examined performance on individual subtests and an aggregate Z score based on eight subtests (NPZ-8), adjusted for age and education. The NPZ-8 was significantly higher in subjects with greater N-acetylaspartate/creatine in the frontal white matter and was lower in subjects with higher myoinositol/creatine in the basal ganglia. Particularly strong associations were found between measures of gross and fine motor function, which correlated positively with N-acetylaspartate/creatine in the frontal white matter and negatively with myoinositol/creatine in the basal ganglia. Similarly, cognitive processing speed was negatively correlated with myoinositol/creatine in the basal ganglia. In contrast, there were no statistically significant relationships between brain metabolite levels in the parietal cortex and neuropsychological function. This study provides convincing evidence that neuropsychological impairment is associated with reduced markers of mature neurons and increased markers of gliosis in the basal ganglia and frontal white matter. Neural changes as reflected by these metabolite levels may prove useful in identifying individuals at risk for neuropsychological impairment.

Epidemiological studies have shown a dose-dependent relationship between concentrations of Hcy and the risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Hcy is a marker for B-vitamin deficiency (folate, B12, B6). Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) causes hypomethylation which is an important mechanism that links Hcy to dementia. Supplementation with vitamins B aims at reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Current evidence suggests that Hcy-lowering treatment has a positive effect for the secondary and primary prevention of stroke. HHcy is very common in patients with Parkinson disease particularly those who receive L-dopa treatment. Furthermore, a positive association has been reported between HHcy and multiple sclerosis. Moreover, HHcy and vitamin B deficiency are reported to have a causal role in depression, and epilepsy. In addition several anti-epileptic drugs cause secondary HHcy. Therefore, sufficient intakes of the vitamins are recommended for patients who have already developed neuropsychiatric diseases. Vitamin B deficiency should be suspected in children with development disorders, failure to thrive and unexplained neurological manifestations. Elderly people are also an important at-risk group where vitamin B deficiency and HHcy have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment with folate, B12, and B6 can improve cerebral function.

It has also been proposed as a marker for the status of the B vitamins, which participate in the metabolism of homocysteine. Therefore, especially in the elderly, it is important to know the prevalence of high homocysteine (tHcy) levels and the influence that B vitamins have on them.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 218 elderly of both sexes, aged 60-105, living in an elderly home in Granada (Spain), were screened for serum folate, red blood cell (RBC) folate, serum cobalamin (B12) (Abbott, IMx), holotranscobalamin II (Holo-TC II) (HoloTC RIA, Axis-Shield), methylmalonic acid (MMA) (MS-GC), total pyridoxine (B6) (HPLC), and total homocysteine (tHcy) (Abbott, IMx).
RESULTS: Hyperhomocysteinemia (tHcy >12 pmol/L) was detected in 80.7%. Serum folate deficiency was severe (< or =4 ng/mL) in 19.3% and moderate (4-7 ng/mL) in 43.1%. In 14.2% of the elderly RBC folate was < or =175 ng/mL, and in 61.0% it was between 175-400 ng/mL. Vitamin B12, measured in serum (< or =200 pg/mL), was deficient in 15.8%, but if measured as Holo-TC II (< or =45 pmol/L), deficiency ranged up to 39.1%. MMA was high (> or =300 nmol/L) in 45.6%. Vitamin B6 (< 20 nmol/L) was low only in one person. In order to identify the factors that could predict tHcy levels, a multiple regression analysis was performed. Best results corresponded to the combination of log serum folate and log Holo-TC II, which gave values of R > 0.5. If analyzed independently, the highest correlation was with log serum folate (r = -0.290), followed by RBC folate (r = -0.263), Holo-TC II (r = -0.228), log B12 (r = -0.175), and log B6 (r = -0.078).
CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of vitamin B deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia in the studied population. Our data confirm the influence of these vitamins, especially folate, on tHcy levels, but hyperhomocysteinemia cannot be used as the only diagnostic criterion to detect subclinical vitamin deficiency in elderly people, especially to detect vitamin B12 deficiency.","2007",,"Int J Vitam Nutr Res",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Aging, TRUE, Erythrocytes, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Female, FALSE, Folic Acid, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Folic Acid Deficiency, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Homocysteine, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, Hyperhomocysteinemia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Institutionalization, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Regression Analysis, FALSE, Sex Characteristics, FALSE, Spain, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Vitamin B 12, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Vitamin B 12 Deficiency, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Vitamin B Complex, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Vitamin B Deficiency, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Our objective was to describe the impact of selected diseases involving chronic inflammation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis) on mortality.
METHODS: We identified a cohort aged 55 to 64 years with one or more chronic conditions. Clusters of mutually exclusive disease combinations were created. Five-year all-cause mortality was determined and the relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated when COPD, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis were added to clusters.
RESULTS: In 741,847 persons the 5-year mortality rates were lowest among persons with one condition and increased with more chronic conditions. The presence of osteoarthritis in a cluster was an exception where the risk was lower compared with that cluster without osteoarthritis: COPD (RR = 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65, 0.81]); ischemic heart disease (0.63 [0.52, 0.76]); hypertension (0.77 [0.71, 0.83]); dementia (0.63 [0.42, 0.93]); depression (0.65 [0.50, 0.84]); hypertension plus diabetes (0.85 [0.77, 0.93]); and ischemic heart disease plus hypertension (0.83 [0.73, 0.94]).

Those lesions in a brain that just experienced a stroke may have lower thresholds for early epileptic seizures. Therefore, epileptic seizures may be a marker of subclinical brain lesions, which may lead to dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that patients with stroke who have epileptic seizures without dementia have an increased risk of new-onset dementia.
METHODS: 169 consecutive patients with stroke without pre-existing dementia recruited in the Lille Stroke/Dementia Study were investigated (90 men; 150 ischaemic strokes; median age 73 years). Pre-stroke cognitive functions were evaluated with the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), with a cut-off of 104 for the diagnosis of dementia. The patients were followed up over a 3-year period. Dementia was diagnosed with International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision criteria in survivors who underwent neurological visits, and with the IQCODE score in those who could not. The relationship between epileptic seizures and new-onset dementia was studied within 3 years, using life-table methods.
RESULTS: 9 patients (5.3%; 95% CI 2.9 to 8.7%) had early seizures. Epileptic seizures were independent predictors of new-onset dementia within 3 years after stroke (HR 3.81; 95% CI 1.13 to 12.82), with increasing age (HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08), IQCODE scores at admission (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.13) and diabetes mellitus (HR 3.52; 95% CI 1.46 to 8.47).

It appears to play a very important regulatory role in the secretion of hormones related to reproductive functions and response to stress. The important elements of this system are: endocannabinoid receptors (types CB1 and CB2), their endogenous ligands (N-arachidonoylethanolamide, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol), enzymes involved in their synthesis and degradation, as well as cannabinoid antagonists. In humans this system also controls energy homeostasis and mainly influences the function of the food intake centers of the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract activity. The endocannabinoid system regulates not only the central and peripheral mechanisms of food intake, but also lipids synthesis and turnover in the liver and adipose tissue as well as glucose metabolism in muscle cells. Rimonabant, a new and selective central and peripheral cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1) blocker, has been shown to reduce body weight and improve cardiovascular risk factor (metabolic syndrome) in obese patients by increasing HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin blood levels as well as decreasing LDL-cholesterol, leptin, and C-reactive protein (a proinflammatory marker) concentrations. It is therefore possible to speculate about a future clinical use of CB1 antagonists, as a means of improving gonadotrophin pulsatility and fertilization capacity as well as the prevention of cardiovasculary disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Drugs acting as agonists of CB1 receptors (Dronabinol, Dexanabinol) are currently proposed for evaluation as drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), epilepsy, anxiety, and stroke.","2007",,"Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online)",," review","Adipose Tissue, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Endocannabinoids, TRUE, Endocrine System, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Energy Metabolism, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Homeostasis, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Hormones, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Lipids, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Liver, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Obesity, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Receptors, Cannabinoid, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

These nosologic problems are caused both by the methods, insufficient to ascertain the diagnosis, as well as by the weak consistency of the clinical concept of VaD itself. One of the most intriguing issues on VaD, and in particular on post-stroke dementia (PSD), is related to the time of development of cognitive decline. In clinical practice, the 3-month time threshold is usually chosen to enable resolution of a possible acute post-stroke delirium, and to obtain a more reliable cognitive assessment with a complete regression of acute neuropsychological stroke-related deficits. Another relevant issue is the possibility to predict which patient will develop PSD. In this regard, recent data indicate an overlap between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and PSD, which seems to share risk factors and neuropathology. In most population samples these two disorders appear together, and the consensus is growing that a degenerative component has a more important role in determining PSD onset shortly after stroke than previously recognized.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in serum TC from midlife to late life and their relationship with late-life cognition.
METHODS: Participants of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia study were derived from random, population-based samples previously studied in a survey in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. After an average follow-up of 21 years, 1,449 individuals aged 65 to 79 were reexamined in 1998.
RESULTS: Serum TC levels decreased in most individuals. High midlife TC represented a risk factor for more severe cognitive impairment later in life, and the values were significantly different between the control, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia groups. There were no significant differences in serum TC at reexamination. A moderate decrease in serum TC from midlife to late life (0.5 to 2 mmol/L) was significantly associated with the risk of a more impaired late-life cognitive status, even after adjusting for age, follow-up time, sex, years of formal education, midlife cholesterol, changes in body mass index, APOE epsilon4 genotype, history of myocardial infarction/stroke/diabetes, and lipid-lowering treatment.

Epidemiological findings suggest an increased risk in subjects with depression. To find out whether frequency of SN hyperechogenicity is increased in depression, we performed TCS of brainstem and basal ganglia in 200 subjects: 55 controls without depression and without Parkinson's disease, 55 subjects with depression without Parkinson's disease (D+ PD-), 45 Parkinson's disease patients without depression (D- PD+) and 45 Parkinson's disease patients with depression (D+ PD+).

Reduced echogenicity of brainstem raphe, thought to reflect alteration of the serotonergic system, was more frequent in depressed than in non-depressed subjects, irrespective of presence of Parkinson's disease, confirming earlier reports. The combined finding of marked SN hyperechogenicity and reduced raphe echogenicity in Parkinson's disease patients, however, was clearly associated with a history of depression prior to Parkinson's disease onset, whereas in D+ PD- patients this combined TCS abnormality was related to motor asymmetry. In D+ PD+ patients with depression prior to Parkinson's disease onset (n = 12), larger SN echogenic sizes correlated with younger age at Parkinson's disease onset (Spearman test, r = -0.607, P = 0.036).

The ubiquitous presence of these lesions and the steady increase of the prevalence of dementia up to 85 years have strongly supported a continuum between normal brain aging and AD. In this context, the study of nonagenarians and centenarians could provide key informations about the characteristics of extreme aging. We provide here a detailed review of currently available neuropathological data in very old individuals and critically discuss the patterns of NFT, SP and neuronal loss distribution as a function of age. In younger cohorts, NFTs are usually restricted to hippocampal formation, whereas clinical signs of dementia appear when temporal neocortex is involved. SPs would not be a specific marker of cognitive impairment as no correlation was found between their quantitative distribution and AD severity. The low rate of AD lesions even in severe AD as well as the weakness of clinicopathological correlations reported in the oldest-old indicate that AD pathology is not a mandatory phenomenon of increasing chronological age.

,"17275850","Increased amyloid beta protein levels in children and adolescents with Down syndrome.","Mehta PD","BACKGROUND: Persons with Down syndrome (DS) (40 years and older) have neuropathological changes characteristic of Alzheimer disease (AD). Soluble forms of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) end at C-terminal residues 40 and 42. The presence of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele is a significant risk factor for the development of sporadic AD. Although preliminary studies have shown an association of plasma Abeta42 and ApoE epsilon4 allele in older persons with DS who have dementia, the relationship between plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels and ApoE phenotypes in children with DS has not been examined. Inflammation might play a role in the growth of DS brains. Neopterin is an immune activation marker for the cell-mediated immune response.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the levels of plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, and neopterin in children or adolescents with DS or controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood was collected from DS (N=35; 7+/-3.8 years old) and their siblings (N=34; 10+/-4.5). Plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42, and neopterin levels were quantitated by sandwich ELISA.
RESULTS: Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were higher in DS than controls. The ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40 was lower in DS than in controls. There were significant negative correlations between age and Abeta40 in DS and controls, and between age and Abeta42 levels in DS but not in controls. There was no association of Abeta40 or Abeta42 levels with Apo E in either group. Neopterin levels were higher in DS than controls, and the levels were not correlated with Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in DS or controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The over expression of APP gene in DS leads to increases in plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels before plaque formation in DS brain. Higher neopterin concentrations in DS reflect inflammatory cell activation. Further studies are needed to determine whether DS children with lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios are at increased risk of developing AD during aging than those with higher ratios.","2007",,"J Neurol Sci"," OBJECTIVE : To examine the levels of plasma Abeta40 , Abeta42 , and neopterin in children or adolescents with DS or controls ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Age Factors, FALSE, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biomarkers, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Child, FALSE, Down Syndrome, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Down-Regulation, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Encephalitis, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neopterin, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Peptide Fragments, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Up-Regulation, FALSE, physiology, Q000502",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of two hospital-based studies. The first (study 1) was an observational study involving 491 admissions. The second study (study 2) involved consecutive admissions assigned to the usual care condition in a controlled clinical trial, and included 461 persons. All participants were elderly (aged 70+) and free from delirium at admission. The outcome was the occurrence of delirium, as rated by the Confusion Assessment Method during hospitalization.

METHODS: Cognition was assessed every 6 months using the ADAS-cog scale in the Real.fr study, a cohort of AD patients. Six classes of ADAS-cog evolution were distinguished, from the severest deterioration (decline >or=7 points) to the greatest cognitive improvement (gain >or=4 points).
RESULTS: Among 536 AD patients, 53 (9.9%) had a 6-month decline of 7 points or more.

We aimed to estimate associations of the marker rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism with fasting glucose, lipids, diabetes prevalence and complications in an older general population.
METHODS: In total, 944 subjects aged > or = 65 years from the population representative InCHIANTI study were enrolled in this study. Those with fasting blood glucose of > or = 7 mmol/l or physician diagnosis were considered diabetic. Cut-off points for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were > or = 5.6 mmol/l to < 7 mmol/l.
RESULTS: In the general population sample, minor (T) allele carriers of rs7903146 had higher fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p = 0.028) but lower fasting insulin (p = 0.030) and HOMA2b scores (p = 0.001), suggesting poorer beta-cell function. T allele carriers also had smaller waist circumference (p = 0.009), lower triglyceride levels (p = 0.006), and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.008). The prevalence of diabetes or IFG was 32.4% in TT carriers and 23.3% in CC carriers; adjusted OR = 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.65, p = 0.031). Within the diabetic and IFG groups, fewer T allele carriers had metabolic syndrome features (p = 0.047) or had experienced a myocardial infarction (p = 0.037). Conversely, T allele carriers with diabetes had poorer renal function (reduced 24-hour creatinine clearance, p = 0.013), and possibly more retinopathy (p = 0.067). Physician-diagnosed dementia was more common in the T carriers (in diabetes p = 0.05, with IFG p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is associated with lower insulin levels, smaller waist circumference, and lower risk lipid profiles in the general elderly population. Patients with diabetes who are carriers of the minor allele are less likely to have metabolic-syndrome features, but may experience more microvascular complications, although the number of cases was small.

With an aging world population the prevalence of dementia will increase dramatically in the next few decades. Of the predicted 114 million who will have dementia in 2050 about three-quarters will live in the less-developed regions. Although strongly age -related, dementia is not an inevitable part of aging but is a true disease caused by exposure to several genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Prevention will be possible when the non genetic risk factors have been identified. Apart from age, more than 20 non-genetic risk factors have been postulated but very few have been established by randomised intervention studies. Elevated blood concentrations of total homocysteine and low-normal concentrations of B vitamins (folate, vitamins B-12 and B-6) are candidate risk factors for both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. A review of the literature up to the end of 2005 shows the following. Seventy seven cross-sectional studies on > 34,000 subjects and 33 prospective studies on > 12,000 subjects have shown associations between cognitive deficit or dementia and homocysteine and/or B vitamins. Biologically plausible mechanisms have been proposed to account for these associations, including atrophy of the cerebral cortex, but a definite causal pathway has yet to be shown. Raised plasma total homocysteine is a strong prognostic marker of future cognitive decline, and is common in world populations. Low-normal concentrations of the B vitamins, the main determinant of homocysteine concentrations, are also common and occur in particularly vulnerable sections of the population, such as infants and the elderly.

Its association with neurodegeneration is further showed by elevated level of 3-chlorotyrosine (bio-marker of HOCl in vivo) in affected brain regions as well as HOCl scavenging ability of neuroprotectants, desferrioxamine and uric acid. In this review, we will summary the current understanding concerning the association of HOCl and neuronal cell death where production of HOCl will lead to further formation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. In addition, HOCl also causes tissue destruction and cellular damage leading cell death.","2007",,"Cell Signal",,"other","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Brain Ischemia, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hydrogen Peroxide, FALSE, Hypochlorous Acid, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Models, Biological, FALSE, Multiple Sclerosis, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, Neurons, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Oxidative Stress, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, Phagocytes, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"16927398","Topographical recognition memory sensitive to amnestic mild cognitive impairment but not to depression.","Ritter E","OBJECTIVE: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) involves episodic memory. The person who presents aMCI has a high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, prediction of deterioration to dementia in cases of aMCI can be confounded with depression due to lack of specificity on selective memory tests. Finding a test sensitive to aMCI but not to depression would be potentially most useful to subsequent longitudinal studies researching the neuropsychological markers of preclinical AD. We hypothesized that the performance on a topographical memory task would be sensitive to the aMCI condition, while depression would not influence such a performance.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A group of 137 community-dwelling French-speaking subjects between 55 and 70 years old was administered a topographical recognition memory task. Based on aMCI and depression criteria, 45 subjects were selected and divided into four groups: 11 patients with aMCI without depression, nine depressive patients with aMCI, ten depressive patients without cognitive impairment and 15 control subjects. The remaining non-selected participants did not belong to any of the previous interest groups.
RESULTS: The 'aMCI' factor had a significant effect on the topographical recognition memory task scores, while the 'depression' factor did not. The aMCI patients performed worse than the non-aMCI.
CONCLUSION: Although these results were found with relatively small groups, deficits in topographical recognition memory were observed in aMCI patients and did not seem to be sensitive to depression. Further longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether deficits in topographical recognition memory are a neuropsychological marker of preclinical AD.","2006",,"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"," OBJECTIVE : Amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) involves episodic memory ","other","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Amnesia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Depressive Disorder, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Diagnosis, Differential, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Memory, TRUE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, standards, Q000592, Parahippocampal Gyrus, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Statistics as Topic, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Here we report the results of a case-control study to identify disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these loci. In the initial phase of our study, we genotyped two putative functional SNPs in ubiquitin-specific protease 24 (USP24), a biological candidate gene within the chromosome 1 linkage region, and scanned the chromosome 2 linkage peak with 43 SNPs in a sample set of 224 PD cases and 186 matched controls. Both USP24 SNPs were significantly associated with disease risk (p = 0.0037 for rs1165222:T > C, p.Thr195ILe, and p = 0.037 for rs13312:C > G, a SNP in the 3'-untranslated region), and one marker, rs1048603:C > T, p.Arg1123Cys, in USP40 was significant from the chromosome 2 scan (p = 0.038). Further genotyping of the region surrounding these initial markers led us to identify 19 additional SNPs with strong disease association. In the second phase, we genotyped the 22 significant markers in an additional 110 cases and 162 controls, which together with part of the initial sample set (201 cases and 149 controls) constitute an expanded sample set of 311 age- and gender-matched case-control pairs.

It is unlikely that population stratification contributed to this finding, as population stratification was undetectable in our sample set using 78 null markers.

Epidemiological studies have confirmed that elevations in plasma tHcy temporally precede the development of dementia and that there is a continuous, inverse linear relation between plasma tHcy concentrations and cognitive performance in older persons. Several potential biological pathways that could mediate the observed association are briefly reviewed. In light of these data and the growing parallel interest in plasma tHcy as an emerging vascular risk factor there was considerable hope that vitamin therapy with folate, B12 and B6, shown to lower plasma tHcy levels, could significantly reduce the risk of stroke and dementia permitting healthy brain aging. The results from recent trials addressing the secondary prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction trials have been disappointing.

,"16894106","[11C]PIB in a nondemented population: potential antecedent marker of Alzheimer disease.","Mintun MA","BACKGROUND: Beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are the hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). A PET imaging tracer that binds to Abeta plaques in vivo, N-methyl-[(11)C]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (or [(11)C]PIB for ""Pittsburgh Compound-B""), has significantly higher binding in subjects diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) compared to nondemented controls. The authors used this imaging technique to investigate whether abnormal binding occurs in clinically normal individuals, prior to the development of cognitive changes.
METHODS: Forty-one nondemented subjects (age range 20 to 86 years) and 10 patients with DAT (age range 66 to 86 years) underwent [(11)C]PIB PET scanning. Regions of interest were drawn on the MRI over the cerebellar, prefrontal, lateral temporal, occipital, gyrus rectus, precuneus, and striatal cortex. Binding potential values (BPs), proportional to the density of [(11)C]PIB-Abeta binding sites, were calculated using the Logan graphical analysis and the cerebellar cortex for a reference tissue.
RESULTS: Patients with DAT had elevated BP values vs nondemented subjects (p < 0.0001). Four of the 41 nondemented subjects had elevated cortical BP values and their BP values as a group were not significantly different from the DAT subjects' BP values. Two of these four nondemented subjects had [(11)C]PIB uptake, both visually and quantitatively, that was indistinguishable from the DAT subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated [(11)C]PIB binding in nondemented subjects suggests that [(11)C]PIB amyloid imaging may be sensitive for detection of a preclinical Alzheimer disease state.

Whether glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level, a marker of glucose control, is predictive of the development of cognitive impairment or dementia is unknown. We determined the association between HbA1C level and risk of developing cognitive impairment in older women, mostly without diabetes.
METHODS: We studied 1983 postmenopausal women (mean age, 67.2 years) with osteoporosis who had HbA1C level measured at baseline. Development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia over 4 years was determined as part of a dementia ancillary study. We analyzed risk of MCI or dementia for every 1% of HbA1C as well as risk associated with HbA1C >or= 7%.
RESULTS: The mean level of HbA1C was 5.8% (range 3.0% to 12.1%) and 86 (4.3%) women developed MCI or dementia. For every 1% increase in HbA1C, women had a greater age-adjusted likelihood of developing MCI (OR= 1.50; 95% CI 1.14-1.97) and of developing MCI or dementia (OR=1.40; 95% CI 1.08 - 1.83). For those with HbA1C level >or= 7% (n=49), the age-adjusted risk for developing MCI was increased nearly 4-fold (OR= 3.70; 95% CI 1.51-9.09) and was increased nearly 3-fold for developing MCI or dementia (OR=2.86; 95% CI 1.17-6.98). When we excluded women with diagnosed diabetes (n=53), the association between HbA1C and MCI lessened somewhat but remained elevated (unadjusted OR=1.59; 95% CI 1.01-2.50; age-adjusted OR=1.42; 95% CI 0.89-2.28). Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, education, race, depression, alcohol use and treatment with raloxifene yielded similar results.

Plasma concentrations of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) rise with age and are increased in people with mutations that cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, Abeta(1-42) concentrations may decrease early in the dementia process. We postulated that concentrations of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in plasma are associated with risk of dementia.
METHODS: We did a case-cohort study embedded in the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study. Of 6713 participants at risk for dementia, a random sample of 1756 people was drawn. During follow-up (mean 8.6 years), 392 incident dementia cases were identified. We investigated the association between plasma Abeta concentrations and risk of dementia and its subtypes using Cox proportional hazard models.
FINDINGS: High concentrations of Abeta(1-40) but not Abeta(1-42) at baseline were associated with an increased risk of dementia. Compared with the first quartile of Abeta(1-40), age and sex-adjusted hazard ratios for dementia for the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.07 (95% CI 0.72-1.58), 1.16 (0.78-1.70), and 1.46 (1.01-2.12). People with an increased Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio had a reduced risk of dementia. Compared with the first quartile of the Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio, hazard ratios for the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.74 (0.53-1.02), 0.62 (0.44-0.88), and 0.47 (0.33-0.67). Associations were similar for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a known risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease, vascular dementia, depression, and possibly some carcinogeneses. Liver transplant recipients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease because of a high incidence of obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The aim of this study is to elucidate the determinants for hyperhomocysteinemia as an additional risk factor in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy stable liver transplant recipients, 48 men (mean age, 50+/-11 years) and 22 women (mean age, 52+/-13 years) had their serum homocysteine levels tested after orthotopic liver transplantation. For mainstay immunosuppression, 53 patients were treated with tacrolimus, 10 with cyclosporine, 3 with mycophenolate mofetil, and 4 with sirolimus. Fasting blood samples were obtained and analyzed immediately (within 1 hour) for total serum homocysteine by high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: In all patients, mean homocysteine levels were 22.7+/-14 micromol/L (normal range, 9-15 micromol/L). Forty-six patients were found to have homocysteine levels>15 micromol/L, and all 70 recipients had homocysteine levels>9 micromol/mL. In our patients, increased homocysteine levels correlated well with body mass index and renal function. Homocysteine levels in patients receiving cyclosporine were higher than those in patients receiving tacrolimus (22.3+/-6 vs 17.9+/-12 micromol/L, P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, homocysteine levels are significantly increased in liver transplant recipients. Homocysteine levels correlate well with obesity, renal function, and the particular immunosuppressant protocol.

,"16717211","Brain volume changes in CADASIL: a serial MRI study in pure subcortical ischemic vascular disease.","Peters N","BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited small vessel disease causing stroke and subcortical vascular dementia. Recent studies in sporadic subcortical ischemic vascular disease have drawn attention to brain atrophy as a clinically important marker of disease progression. However, little is known about the role of brain atrophy and its clinical correlates in CADASIL.
METHOD: The authors determined the normalized brain volume (NBV) and percent brain volume change (PBVC) over 2 years in 76 CADASIL subjects (45.1 +/- 9.7 years) using the SIENA (structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy) software and its adaptation for cross-sectional measurements (SIENAX). Baseline assessments included systolic blood pressure (SBP), homocysteine levels, BMI, and APOE genotyping. T2-lesion volumes and clinical scales were assessed at both time points.
RESULTS: The NBV significantly correlated with all clinical scores (Rankin, NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel, structured interview for the diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia and multi-infarct dementia, Mattis dementia rating scale) at both time points independently of age and sex. PBVC correlated with changes of all clinical scores (all p < 0.01) except for the Mattis dementia rating scale (p = 0.10). In a linear regression model, age (p < 0.001), male sex (p < 0.01), and SBP (p = 0.07) were the main risk factors for a lower NBV at baseline. Age (p < 0.001) and SBP (p = 0.01) were risk factors for brain volume loss during follow-up. Sample size estimates showed that the number of individuals needed to demonstrate a treatment effect in a trial can be reduced when PBVC is used as an endpoint.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies brain atrophy as an important aspect of the disease process in CADASIL and establishes significant correlations with multiple clinical aspects including cognition. Age and systolic blood pressure are risk factors for brain volume loss during follow-up. Percent brain volume change seems promising as an adjunct outcome measure in future interventional trials.","2006",,"Neurology"," However , little is known about the role of brain atrophy and its clinical correlates in CADASIL ","other","Adult, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, CADASIL, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Comorbidity, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Fibrinogen, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Homocysteine, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, Hypercholesterolemia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Hypertension, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Organ Size, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Data from several studies suggest that mild elevations of homocysteine in plasma are a risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. In the Framingham studies we have shown that plasma total homocysteine concentration is inversely related to the intake and plasma levels of folate and vitamin B-6 as well as vitamin B-12 plasma levels. Almost two-thirds of the prevalence of high homocysteine is attributable to low vitamin status or intake. Elevated homocysteine concentrations in plasma are a risk factor for prevalence of extracranial carotid artery stenosis of at least 25% in both men and women. Prospectively elevated plasma homocysteine is associated with increased total and CVD mortality, increased incidence of stroke, increased incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, increased incidence of bone fracture, and higher prevalence of chronic heart failure. This multitude of relationships between elevated plasma total homocysteine and diseases that afflict the elderly point to the existence of a common denominator that may be responsible for these diseases.

DESIGN: Cohort study (Edinburgh Artery Study).
SETTING: Eleven general practices in Edinburgh, Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred seventeen men and women aged 55 to 74 from the general population, followed for 10 years.
MEASUREMENTS: ABI measured at baseline and major cognitive functions (including premorbid function using the National Adult Reading Test, NART) tested after 10 years.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age and sex, a low ABI was associated with lower scoring (bottom tertile vs top tertile) on Raven's Matrices (odds ratio (OR)=1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.0-2.6), Verbal Fluency (OR =1.8, 95% CI =1.1-3.0), and Digit Symbol Test (OR =2.3, 95% CI =1.3-4.2), suggesting that the ABI is predictive of poorer performance in nonverbal reasoning, verbal fluency, and information processing speed. The association between ABI and the Digit Symbol Test remained significant after further adjustment for premorbid cognitive function (tested using the NART), suggesting that the ABI is also predictive of decline in information processing speed (from premorbid ability to that measured here in older age).
CONCLUSION: The ABI may be useful in identifying older individuals at higher risk of cognitive impairment.

Telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was tested as prognostic risk marker.
METHODS: A cohort of 195 nondemented stroke survivors was followed prospectively from 3 months after stroke for 2 years for cognitive assessment and diagnosis of dementia and for 5 years for survival. Telomere lengths in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured at 3 months after stroke by in-gel hybridization. Hazard ratios for survival in relation to telomere length and odds ratios for dementia were estimated using multivariate techniques, and changes in Mini-Mental State Examination scores between baseline and 2 years were related to telomere length using multivariate linear regression.

Usually they are assumed to have a benign prognosis, although they do very occasionally present with ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the first manifestation of the syndrome. Discovering a WPW pattern in a previously asymptomatic athlete on a routine electrocardiogram (ECG) identifies the necessity for more accurate screening tests. However, non-invasive methods (Holter monitoring, exercise treadmill testing) seem to be relatively incomplete for risk stratification, especially for athletes. Current guidelines do not always recommend a routine electrophysiological study (EPS) in patients with an asymptomatic WPW ECG pattern, especially in children younger than 12 years. Individuals who engage in high-risk occupations or those patients who have a pre-excitation pattern which precludes them from following their chosen career or activities may be exceptions.

,"16611017","Predictors of conversion to dementia of probable Alzheimer type in patients with mild cognitive impairment.","Modrego PJ","BACKGROUND: Mild Cognitive Impairment is a common condition defined as transitional state between normality and dementia of Alzheimer type. Clinically is characterized by subjective and objective memory loss beyond the expected for age and educational level, although a broad range of cognitive inefficiencies may appear, with preservation of daily living activities. Approximately half the patients convert to dementia within 3 years. Since no all patients convert to dementia it is essential to find reliable predictors so as to start the appropriate treatment as soon as possible.
METHOD: Extensive Medline-based search for articles dealing with predictors of conversion to dementia in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
RESULTS: There is a substantial body of literature dealing with predictors of dementia in patients with MCI. These predictors range from a simple delayed recall task on Mini-Mental to sophisticated radiological techniques and CSF biomarkers. Comprehensive neuropsychological tests rarely surpass 70% sensitivity and specificity. The presence of the APOE epsilon 4 allele has been associated with increased risk of conversion but the sensitivity is quite low. CSF biochemical markers are being developed with encouraging results. beta-amyloid 42 protein is usually lower in converters than in people with stable cognitive status and tau protein is higher. The sensitivity is substantial but specificity is so far low. An epitope of tau protein (P231) looks more specific of Alzheimer's disease and therefore a promising biomarker. In the blood, high beta-amyloid protein levels indicate risk of conversion but only a few studies have been published. Hippocampal or entorhinal atrophy on MRI is one of the most used radiological markers of conversion but quantification of atrophy is not simple as it is subject to artifacts and anatomic variations. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are emerging as the most promising predictive tools. The highest degree of accuracy (>90%) has been achieved by means of PET plus either memory performance or APOE4 genotype. However, the samples of the published studies are mostly small, and these instruments are not widely available.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no enough evidence to recommend specific techniques for predictions. Until an accurate marker is developed, a combined use of cognitive tests, APOE genotype, and a neuroradiological technique is probably the best option for prediction purposes depending on availability and experience.","2006",,"Curr Alzheimer Res"," Clinically is characterized by subjective and objective memory loss beyond the expected for age and educational level , although a broad range of cognitive inefficiencies may appear , with preservation of daily living activities "," review","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Dementia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

MEASUREMENTS: All participants underwent in-home full-night polysomnography. Demographic and lifestyle factors, depression, diseases, and medication that could affect inflammation, coagulation, and sleep were controlled for in analyses regressing sleep variables and caregiver status and their interaction on plasma levels of IL-6 and D-dimer.

In 1992, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels were obtained from 81 women. Increasing serum potassium in 1968 was associated with increasing cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 (beta = 153.9, P = 0.041) in 1992 using age-adjusted linear regression. Compared with the lowest tertile of potassium, the middle (beta = 95.3, P = 0.138) and highest tertiles (beta = 193.5, P = 0.004) had incrementally increased cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels. Associations remained after controlling for blood pressure and other factors, and were similar among the 17 women in 1974 with available serum potassium. Potassium in 1980 and 1992 was not associated with cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42.

METHODS: We measured plasma levels of the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, using a high-sensitivity assay (hs-CRP) in 4,231 older participants of the Women's Health Study, who provided blood samples between 1992 and 1996 when they were age 60 to 90 years. From 1998 to 2000, we administered a battery of 5 cognitive tests measuring general cognition, verbal memory, and category fluency. Using multiple linear regression, we compared mean cognitive test scores across quintiles of hs-CRP, adjusting for potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: There was a wide distribution of hs-CRP levels among these women, and a large proportion had levels considered to reflect a high risk of cardiovascular disease. We observed no suggestion, however, that higher hs-CRP levels were associated with poorer cognitive performance. For example, on a global score combining results of all the cognitive tests, mean scores among women in the highest quintile of hs-CRP did not differ from those in the lowest quintile (multivariable-adjusted mean difference = 0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.02 to 0.11, P for trend across quintiles = 0.38).

Results show decreased activity of Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) whereas the level of lipid peroxidation increased with age, and after the hormone treatments both AChE activity and level of lipid peroxidation returned to control values. The deposition of lipofuscin, a pigment that accumulated intraneuronally in brain and other tissues and is considered a marker of aging, was increased with aging and the hormone treatment decreased this deposition. The present study clearly shows reduction in risk factors associated with aging in the murine model system by hormone treatments, namely estrogen and progesterone by increasing the activity of acetylcholine esterase and decreasing the levels of lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin deposition in different parts of aging brain.

These measures linked to lipoprotein metabolism appear to be altered in AD, VaD, or predementia syndrome relative to controls, but with contrasting results. At present, several studies have demonstrated the dependence of APOE serum levels upon the APOE genotype, nonetheless serum APOE levels seems not to be a credible risk factor or a biochemical marker for AD instead of APOE genotyping. In fact, there was no consistent association of serum or plasma apoE protein levels with the disease when controlled for APOE genotype. In addition, there are some evidence that higher Lp(a) levels could be linked with AD, although there are studies suggesting an increased presence of low molecular weight apo(a) in AD, VaD, and frontotemporal dementia, that are associated with elevated Lp(a) levels. In fact, the apo(a) gene is highly polymorphic in length due to variation in the numbers of a sequence encoding the apo(a) kringle 4 domain, and plasma levels of Lp(a) are inversely correlated with apo(a) size. Furthermore, although serum/plasma levels of TC and 24S-hydroxycholesterol are not credible diagnostic markers for AD and cognitive decline, the current evidence suggests that they may be modifiable risk/protective factors. The prevailing wisdom is that high TC is a risk factor for dementia. However, the relationship between TC and dementia may vary considerably depending on when cholesterol is measured over the life course or, alternatively, in relation to the underlying course of the disease. Several observational studies have suggested that statins, which are effective in lowering cholesterol, may reduce the risk of dementia, but the results of these reports are inconclusive. Thus, more studies with long-term follow-up and serial assessments of TC are needed to further clarify the causal relationship between cholesterol and dementia.","2006",,"Brain Res Rev",," review","Animals, FALSE, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cholesterol, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Dementia, Vascular, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lipids, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Lipoprotein(a), FALSE, blood, Q000097, Risk Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

OBJECTIVES: (1) To evaluate whether coping processes affect hemostatic reactivity to acute psychological stress and (2) whether these effects differ substantially between caregivers and noncaregivers.
METHODS: Sixty elderly community-dwelling spousal caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease and 33 noncaregiving controls completed the revised Ways of Coping Questionnaire to assess approach/problem-solving versus avoidant coping processes. Participants were administered an acute stress test that required them to deliver a 3-minute speech challenge to the interviewer on an assigned topic. The hypercoagulability marker D-dimer was measured at three time points: baseline, immediately postspeech, and during recovery (15 minutes postspeech).
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that subjects who endorsed greater levels of approach coping had decreased levels of D-dimer at all time points (p = .048). A significant three-way interaction between planful problem solving, caregiver status, and the temporal pattern of D-dimer was found (p = .004), indicating that caregivers with low levels of planful problem solving exhibited greater increases in D-dimer from baseline to speech and recovery time points relative to controls. No relationship between avoidant coping and D-dimer was found.

Data were compared with 12 age-matched healthy control subjects. To objectively localize focal changes of structural neuronal integrity without having to make an a priori hypothesis as to its location statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied to our DWI study. SPM localized significant increases of diffusivity in the region of both olfactory tracts in patients (P < 0.001).

The biological plausibility for potential protective effects of T on brain functions is substantial. In addition, higher levels of gonadotropins found in older cases with AD suggest that low levels of T are not due to brain degeneration and that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is still intact. Men genetically at risk for AD were also already found to have lower levels of T. However, despite having lower levels of T, women do not show accelerated cognitive decline with age when compared to men. In addition, castration has not necessarily shown a decline in cognitive functions; some studies even found improvement of memory recall. Age may be an important factor when assessing optimal levels of T and several studies suggest that free or bioavailable T may be a better marker than total T levels when investigating associations of androgen activity with cognitive function. Small-scale T intervention trials in elderly men with and without dementia suggest that some cognitive deficits may be reversed, at least in part, by short term T supplementation. Age and prior hypogonadism may play an important role in therapy success and these factors should be investigated in more detail in future large scale randomized controlled studies.

METHODS: The relationship between sCRP and score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a commonly used screening cognitive measure, was investigated in 540 well functioning, healthy, and cognitively normal elders (age 73 +/- 6 years). Sociodemographic status, lifestyle, health status, traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors including plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), and other peripheral blood markers of vascular inflammation (leukocyte count, serum albumin, and plasma fibrinogen) were also assessed.
RESULTS: Risk for having sCRP in the highest decile (>0.7 mg/dl) was significantly higher in individuals with MMSE score 24-25 (odds ratio = 3.07, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-7.9) and 26-28 (odds ratio = 2.10, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.9) compared with those scoring above 28 (reference group). Results were unaffected by adjustment for all potential confounders. No association was found between MMSE and peripheral markers of vascular inflammation other than sCRP, but lower MMSE scores were also independently associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (plasma tHcy > 15 mmol/L).
CONCLUSION: In healthy, cognitively normal elderly community dwellers, increased sCRP levels are associated with concurrent cognitive impairment as measured by MMSE.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Research volunteers living throughout the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 396 persons (mean age 75) who were graduates of the same high school in the mid-1940s.
MEASUREMENTS: Adolescent intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were gathered from archived student records, and activity levels were determined from yearbooks. A two-stage telephone screening procedure (Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status or Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly followed by Dementia Questionnaire) was used to determine adult cognitive status. Data were analyzed using logistic regression to model the risk of cognitive impairment (dementia/MCI) versus no cognitive impairment as a function of IQ and activity level, adjusting for sex and education.
RESULTS: High adolescent IQ and greater activity level were each independently associated with a lower risk for dementia/MCI (odds ratio (OR) for a 1-standard deviation increase in IQ=0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.32-0.79; OR for a unit increase in activity=0.32, 95% CI=0.12-0.84). No association was found between sex or education and adult cognitive status in this model.

,"15971638","[The estimation of premorbid intelligence levels in French speakers].","Mackinnon A","UNLABELLED: Knowledge of cognitive performance earlier in life is essential in order to characterize precisely the extent to which these abilities have declined when an individual is diagnosed as having a dementing illness. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) was developed by Nelson and O'Connell to estimate premorbid intellectual ability in patients suffering from intellectual deterioration due to dementia. The test consists of 50 words, graded in difficulty, whose pronunciation cannot be determined from their spelling. The ability to successfully read irregularly spelt words is relatively robust in the face of current cognitive impairment and is a sensitive marker of intellectual attainment. Because the NART relies on orthographic irregularities in the English language, the construction of analogues of the test in other languages is not simply a matter of translation of the test content. Rather, words in the target language that have comparable properties to those in the NART must be sought. A French adaptation of the NART--the fNART--was developed by Bovet and calibrated on a small French-speaking Swiss sample. In a sample of 30 nondemented subjects, number of words pronounced correctly correlated highly with WAIS-R verbal and total IQ scores and less strongly with performance IQ (r = 0.43). Data available from an epidemiological survey undertaken in Geneva, Switzerland provided an opportunity to establish the measurement properties and construct validity of the fNART in a large sample unselected with respect to cognitive decline. In addition to the fNART, the survey incorporated a brief test battery assessing the domains of crystallized intelligence, memory and cognitive speed. An interview that enabled the diagnosis of dementia according to DSM IV criteria, the Mini Mental State Examination and the Psychogeriatric Assessment Scales (PAS) were also administered. If the fNART measures intellectual ability, substantial correlations between it and the test battery would be expected. Further validation of the test was sought by exploring its relation with years of education. The stability of the fNART was assessed by comparing the scores of subjects with and without dementia, and by examining the relationship of fNART scores to an informant-based report of change in cognitive performance from earlier in life assessed in the PAS. If the fNART is stable in the face of cognitive deterioration, no between-group differences or association with reported cognitive change would be expected.
METHOD: Subjects were randomly selected from residents of the canton of Geneva aged over 65 years. The analyses reported here were undertaken on a sample of 368 persons who gave codable responses to at least 90% of the fNART items. They ranged in age from 65 to 94 years. Subjects were interviewed in their homes by trained lay interviewers.
RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for the forty-item scale was high (0.89). The percentage of subjects correctly pronouncing words ranged from 7.3% for ""chamsin"" to 96.7% for ""agenda"". Item response theory (IRT) models were fitted to the data. In a three-parameter model the value of the guessing (asymptote) parameter was vanishing small for all items. Accordingly, a two-parameter model was adopted. The discriminating power (slope) of items ranged considerably from 0.281 (rébus) to 1.192 (béotien). The average slope was 0.656. This corresponds to average factor loading of 0.528 (range 0.270 to 0.766.) The items measure a broad range of ability (mean threshold--0.719, sd = 1.540). Most items, however, discriminate at moderate levels. The parameter values obtained in the current study were compared to those estimated in a French sample of persons at risk of dementia . The correlation between item pairs for slope and parameter estimates was 0.53 and 0.70 respectively. This indicated substantial concordance between the samples regarding the difficulty of the items, but some differences in the power of groups to differentiate ability. In particular, a small number of words that performed very well in the ""at risk"" sample showed more moderate discrimination in the current study. Scores on the fNART were correlated with measures of crystallised intelligence, memory and cognitive speed. All correlations were statistically significant. With all tests entered a regression equation the multiple correlation coefficient was 0.63. Mean fNART scores of those suffering from DSM IV dementia and those meeting only Criterion A (multiple cognitive deficits) were lower than those of subjects meeting neither set of criteria. However subjects in the first two groups were older than subjects in the undemented group and had significantly lower educational attainment. When these two factors were controlled in an analysis of covariance, the magnitude of the differences between the groups, while still overall significantly different, was substantially reduced. A similar pattern of results applied when psychometric measures of cognitive state--the MMSE and the PAS Cognitive Impairment Scale--were used instead of diagnostic categories. The partial correlations of the fNART with the MMSE and PAS cognitive impairment scale controlling for age and education were 0.25 (P < 0.01) and -0.33 (P < 0.01) respectively. fNART scores did not differ between the sexes, nor were they significantly correlated with PAS Depression, Stroke or Behaviour Change scales. There was a small but significant correlation between the fNART and informant-assessed Cognitive Decline on the PAS.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated the excellent measurement properties of a French adaptation of the National Adult Reading Test in a large probability sample of elderly native speakers and provided the first large-sample evidence to support the validity of the fNART as a test of intellectual functioning relatively robust to dementia status. The negligible values of the pseudo-guessing parameters suggest that the goal of choosing words whose pronunciation is not susceptible to guessing has been achieved. The average item discriminability was high and the words used covered the spectrum of ability. The finding of substantial relationships of cognitive performance and educational attainment with fNART scores is important in validating the test as a measure of premorbid cognitive ability. The low correlations of the fNART with informant-based assessment of cognitive decline and age support the fNART as being relative robust to decline in ability. The relationships observed in this French adaptation are comparable to those reported for the English instrument . However, subjects meeting DSM IV criteria for dementia or Criterion A only had lower scores than other subjects. Decline in NART scores with dementia has been observed, particularly in moderate and severe cases. Given that the mechanism of the fNART is the same as the NART it is to be expected that while generally robust to current dementia status, some decline in performance will occur with the progression of the disease. The relationships between the fNART and PAS scales was remarkably similar to those reported by Jorm et al. in an English-speaking sample between the PAS and NART. Although small, the correlation between the fNART and the PAS Cognitive Decline scale might have been expected to be non-significant if the measure were truly stable in the face of intellectual deterioration. However this correlation is mirrored in the original English instruments and may reflect the higher risk of dementia in persons of lower intellectual ability.
CONCLUSION: Further research is desirable to improve the precision of the calibration of the scale against the WAIS-R. Nevertheless, this study has demonstrated that the fNART is a reliable and valid method of assessing premorbid intellectual ability in French speakers.","2005",,"Encephale",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Dementia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, France, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Intelligence, TRUE, Language, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Reading, FALSE, Sick Role, TRUE, Switzerland, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Wechsler Scales, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Genetics. Although the genetic role has been demonstrated, there is an important genetic heterogeneity; 4. Tobacco. Various studies have found a protective effect, however this effect could be attributed to survival bias; 5. Alcohol. The regular consumption of alcohol was associated with reduced incidence of AD, especially with wine consumption; 6. Family history of dementia. Nearly 40% of persons with AD have family history of dementia; 7. Non steroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs). The use of NSAIDS could help in reducing the symptoms of the disease or even avoid them; 8. Craneoencephalic trauma. The role of the craneoencephalic trauma is controversial; 9. Education.

Because NAA is considered a marker of neuronal integrity, reduced medial temporal and parietal lobe NAA could be an early indication of dementia-related pathology in elderly individuals.
OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine whether cognitively impaired but nondemented (CIND) elderly individuals exhibit a similar pattern of reduced medial temporal and parietal lobe NAA as AD patients. 2) To compare regional NAA patterns, hippocampal and neocortical gray matter (GM) volumes in CIND patients who remained cognitively stable and those who became demented over 3.6 years of follow-up. 3) To examine the relationship between memory performance, medial temporal lobe NAA, and hippocampal volume.
METHODS: Seventeen CIND, 24 AD, and 24 cognitively normal subjects were studied using MRSI and MRI.
RESULTS: Relative to controls, CIND patients had reduced MTL NAA (19 to 21%, p = 0.005), hippocampal (11 to 14%, p < or = 0.04), and neocortical GM (5%, p = 0.05) volumes. CIND patients who later became demented had less MTL NAA (26%, p = 0.01), hippocampal (17 to 23%, p < or = 0.05), and neocortical GM (13%, p = 0.02) volumes than controls, but there were no significant differences between stable CIND patients and controls. MTL NAA in combination with hippocampal volume improved discrimination of CIND and controls over hippocampal volume alone. In AD and CIND patients, decreased MTL NAA correlated significantly with impaired memory performance.

We also report the long-term prognosis of PD patients seen in our clinic. Modern research on the pathogenesis started after the discovery of MPTP. We found inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by MPTP and MPP+. Mitochondrial respiratory failure induces oxidative damage to high molecular weight substances. Both mitochondrial failure and oxidative stress are important triggers of apoptosis. We found TUNEL positive nigral neurons in PD patients suggesting involvement of apoptosis in the pathogenesis. Interaction of genetic risk factors and environmental neurotoxins has been implicated in the etiology of PD. While we were investigating MnSOD gene polymorphism in PD patients, we found a young onset autosomal recessive PD family that was linked to the MnSOD locus. Subsequent linkage analysis on 13 families of young onset autosomal recessive families disclosed the linkage of this disease to the telomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q25.2-27). Then we were lucky enough to find a patient who had a deletion of one of the microsatellite markers (D6S305) that we were using in the linkage analysis. We thought this marker might be located within the disease gene and this was the case. We screened the Keio BAC library with this marker, and eventually we cloned a novel gene encompassing 1.4 Mb; we named it parkin. The coding region consisted of 1,395 base pairs. The parkin protein had an unique sequence in that there was a 30% homology in the amino terminal region and two RING-finger motives on the carboxy terminal side. This unique structure suggested that the parkin protein was related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Parkin protein turned out to be an ubiquitin-protein ligase. Numbers of parkin-interacting proteins were reported in the literature and accumulation of parkin-substrates is likely to be the cause for the nigral neuronal death in this familial PD. Regarding the prognosis of PD, we analyzed the patients who visited our clinic from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 2002. The total of patients recruited was 1,772. The average age of onset was 57.2 years. Mean levodopa dose at the final examination was 479 mg/day. The most common initial symptom was tremor which was seen in 51% of the patients. Total percentage of patients who had tremor during the course of the disease was 75%. Long-term prognosis was evaluated on a subgroup of the patients who visited our clinic within 5 years from the onset and Hoehn and Yahr stage III or less when first seen. Analysis was done by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Percentages of patients who reached Hoehn and Yahr III 5, 10, and 15 years after the onset were 24%, 46%, and 65%, respectively. Percentages of patients who developed wearing off fluctuations were 5, 10, and 15 years after the start of levodopa were 18%, 46%, and 55%, respectively. Overall mortality on the total investigated patients was 7.9%. When compared to the age at death of Japanese population, mortality of men PD patients became very close to that of the general population in the year 2003. However, that in women PD patients showed significantly shorter survival compared to Japanese female population. Average ages of onset and the death were essentially similar between men and women PD patients. Survival curves to reach stage III and wearing off showed slightly but significantly faster time courses for women compared to those of men. This was an unexpected observation and its mechanism was discussed.

,"15642856","Bone mineral density and the risk of Alzheimer disease.","Tan ZS","BACKGROUND: Some, but not all, studies have suggested that estrogen replacement therapy has a beneficial effect on cognition in postmenopausal women. Bone mineral density (BMD) is a potential surrogate marker for cumulative estrogen exposure and has been associated with cognitive performance and risk of cognitive deterioration.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether low BMD in elderly individuals is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Community-based prospective cohort study of 987 subjects (610 women) who were cognitively intact and had baseline BMD measured at the femoral neck, the trochanter, and the radial shaft between 1988 and 1989.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of AD and all-cause dementia during an 8-year follow-up period.
RESULTS: Women in the lowest quartile of femoral neck BMD had more than twice the incidence of AD (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-3.75) and all-cause dementia (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.49) compared with those in higher quartiles after adjusting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E epsilon4, baseline homocysteine level, education, estrogen use, smoking, and stroke. A similar but statistically nonsignificant relationship was observed between BMD of the femoral trochanter and AD, while no such relationship was seen between radial BMD and AD or all-cause dementia.

This study examined the relationship between transferrin saturation (TS) and cholesterol to see if both are necessary to increase the risk for the subsequent development of AD.
METHODS: We analyzed data from US adults (ages 40-74 years at baseline) followed from baseline in 1971-1974 to 1992 (n=6,558) in the cohort study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS).
RESULTS: The unadjusted relative risk of developing AD when both TS and cholesterol were at the 75th percentile was 3.19 (95% CI, 1.31-7.75). In adjusted models when only one marker was elevated, there was no significant increased risk for AD. The risk of AD increased as both markers increased. Even at the 85th percentile, individuals had no significant risk of AD when only having elevated cholesterol (>280 mg/dl) but not elevated TS (39.6%).

METHODS: Subjects were 48 (30 female and 18 male) elderly (mean age +/- SD, 72 +/- 9 years) community-dwelling spousal Alzheimer caregivers and 20 noncaregiving age- and gender-matched controls. Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III, fibrin D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 were measured.
RESULTS: D-dimer, a marker of fibrin formation and degradation, was significantly higher in caregivers than in controls (688 +/- 575 vs. 406 +/- 157 ng/ml, p = 0.021).

Therefore, a multicenter MRS consortium was formed to evaluate the neurometabolites in HIV patients with or without cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at short-echo time (30 ms) was assessed in the frontal white matter, basal ganglia, and parietal cortex of 100 HIV patients [61 with AIDS dementia complex (ADC) and 39 neuroasymptomatic (NAS)] and 37 seronegative (SN) controls.
RESULTS: Compared to SN, NAS had higher glial marker myoinositol-to-creatine ratio (MI/Cr) in the white matter (multivariate analyses, adjusted P=0.001), while ADC showed further increased MI/Cr in the white matter and basal ganglia (both P<0.001), and increased choline compounds (Cho)/Cr in white matter (P=0.04) and basal ganglia (P<0.001). Compared to NAS, ADC showed a reduction in the neuronal marker N-acetyl compound (NA)/Cr in the frontal white matter (P=0.007). CSF, but not plasma, viral load correlated with MI/Cr and Cho/Cr in white matter and NAA/Cr in parietal cortex. HIV infection and aging had additive effects on Cho/Cr and MI/Cr in the basal ganglia and white matter.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that glial activation occurs during the NAS stages of HIV infection, whereas further inflammatory activity in the basal ganglia and neuronal injury in the white matter is associated with the development of cognitive impairment.

Furthermore, raised serum total homocysteine has been associated with atrophic changes in the brain. An association between serum vitamin B(12)/folate and cognitive impairment would be of considerable public health importance in view of the increasing numbers of elderly people.
AIM: To systematically review published studies on the relationship between serum vitamin B(12), folate and total homocysteine and cognitive function in the elderly.
DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was undertaken of published evidence in English, examining the association between low serum vitamin B(12)/folate and raised total homocysteine with cognitive impairment (as indicated by low scores on neuropsychological testing) in subjects aged over 60 years. Sixteen electronic databases and cited articles were searched. Of 383 potential articles, six fulfilled the eligibility criteria: three case control and three cohort studies were identified. 'The Cochrane Non-Randomized Studies Methods Group' guidelines were used for assessment and extraction of data from these studies.
RESULTS: All three case control studies found that serum total homocysteine was significantly higher in cases when compared with controls, and there was wide variation for both serum vitamin B(12) and folate in both groups of participants. The relationship of serum folate and vitamin B(12) status with cognitive impairment was heterogeneous and one case control study reported decreasing cognitive scores with increasing serum vitamin B(12). In the cohort studies, although serum total homocysteine could predict the rate of decline in neuropsychological testing, the overall odds ratio/relative risk (RR) of developing cognitive impairment in relation to levels of serum B(12) and serum folate were not significant. Although one study reported a significant RR of developing Alzheimer's disease when both serum folate and B(12) levels were low. One cohort study reported an increased prevalence of Alzheimer's type dementia in subjects who had normal serum vitamin B(12) at baseline.
CONCLUSION: Serum total homocysteine is negatively correlated with neuropsychological tests scores. But the evidence does not support a correlation between serum vitamin B(12) or folate and cognitive impairment in people aged over 60 years. Hence, there is little evidence to justify treating cognitive impairment with vitamin B(12) or folate supplementation. This is consistent with the findings from recent systematic reviews of randomized double-blind trials, which have not found any evidence of potential benefit of vitamin supplementation. Further research is required in order to establish whether raised serum total homocysteine is a cause or consequence of disease.","2004",,"J Hum Nutr Diet"," AIM : To systematically review published studies on the relationship between serum vitamin B ( 12 ) , folate and total homocysteine and cognitive function in the elderly ","meta analysis","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Folic Acid, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Homocysteine, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Vitamin B 12, FALSE, blood, Q000097",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Long-term storage of specific VOSs over years, evident frrom exhalation pattern during the postexposure period, may serve as a promoting factor to form continuously TaClo non-enzymatically from tryptamine and trichloroacetaldehyde.

,"15103481","[Age-associated changes in the metabolism of vitamin B(12) and folic acid: prevalence, aetiopathogenesis and pathophysiological consequences].","Wolters M","The increasing number of older people is characteristic for most industrialised nations and implicates the known psychosocial and economic consequences. Therefore, an optimal nutrient supply that promotes continuing mental and physical well-being is particularly important. In this respect, vitamin B(12) and folic acid play a major role, since deficiency of both vitamins is associated with the pathogenesis of different diseases such as declining neurocognitive function and atherosclerotic lesions. Vitamin B(12) and folic acid act as coenzymes and show a close molecular interaction on the basis of the homocysteine metabolism. In addition to the serum concentrations of the vitamins, the metabolites homocysteine and methylmalonic acid are sensitive markers of cobalamin and folate status. Depending on the used marker, 3-60% of the elderly are classified as vitamin B(12) deficient and about 29% as folate deficient. Predominantly, this high prevalence of poor cobalamin status is caused by the increasing prevalence of atrophic gastritis type B, which occurs with a frequency of approximately 20-50% in elderly subjects. Atrophic gastritis results in declining gastric acid and pepsinogen secretion, and hence decreasing intestinal digestion and absorption of both B vitamins. This is the reason why an insufficient vitamin B(12) status in the elderly is rarely due to low dietary intake. In contrast, folic acid intake among elderly subjects is generally well below the recommended dietary reference values. Even moderately increased homocysteine levels or poor folate and vitamin B(12) status are associated with vascular disease and neurocognitive disorders. Results of a meta-analysis of prospective studies revealed that a 25% lower homocysteine level (about 3 micromol/L) was associated with an 11% lower ischemic heart disease risk and 19% lower stroke risk. It is still discussed, whether hyperhomocysteinemia is causally related to vascular disease or whether it is a consequence of atherosclerosis. Estimated risk reduction is based on cohort studies, not on clinical trials. Homocysteine initiates different proatherogenetic mechanisms such as the formation of reactive oxygen species and an enhanced fibrin synthesis. Supplementation of folic acid (0.5-5 mg/d) reduces the homocysteine concentration by 25%. Additional vitamin B(12) (0.5 mg/d) induces further reduction by 7%. In secondary prevention, supplementation already led to clinical improvements (reduction of restenosis rate and plaques). Depression, dementia, and mental impairment are often associated with folate and vitamin B(12) deficiency. The biochemical reason of this finding may be the importance of folic acid and vitamin B(12) for the transmethylation of neuroactive substances (myelin, neurotransmitters) which is impaired in vitamin deficiency (""hypomethylation hypothesis"").

,"14991453","Core biological marker candidates of Alzheimer's disease - perspectives for diagnosis, prediction of outcome and reflection of biological activity.","Hampel H","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative dementing illness. Over the past few years, however, remarkable advances have taken place in understanding both the genetic and molecular biology with the intracellular processing of amyloid and tau and the changes leading to the pathologic formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and the intraneuronal aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau into neurofibrillary tangles. This progress in our understanding of the molecular pathology has set the stage for clinically meaningful advances in the development of biomarkers. Emerging diagnostic methods that are based on biochemical and imaging biomarkers of disease specific pathology hold the potential to provide effective measures of natural history (marker of disease that is predictive of outcome), biological activity (such as magnitude and frequency of response correlating with drug potency) and markers of surrogate endpoints (single or composite marker that accounts for clinical benefit of the therapy). Markers of biological activity should be also evaluated regarding their value to reflect disease progression, heterogeneity of the clinical population, for early decision making and characterization of new treatments. We focussed on the current status of core analytes which provide reasonable evidence for association with key mechanisms of pathogenesis or neurodegeneration in AD. In addition, feasibility was important, such as availability of a validated assay for the biological measure in question, with properties that included high precision and reliability of measurement, reagents and standards well described. On this basis we reviewed the body of literature that has examined CSF total tau (t-tau) and beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and beta-amyloid-antibodies as diagnostic tests for AD versus clinically representative comparison groups. Measurement of t-tau and Abeta(1-42) in the CSF seems useful to discriminate early and incipient AD from age-associated memory-impairment, depression, and some secondary dementias. First studies showed that measurement of p-tau proteins significantly improves early and differential diagnosis, as well as disease prediction in subjects at risk for AD and comes closest to fulfilling proposed criteria of a biological marker for AD. However, the nature of the majority of reported findings are still preliminary and retrospective. General issues for biomarkers have to be adequately addressed, such as sensitivity of the method, frequency of assessments, stability of the method, standardization of methods and dynamic range. There is still a partial lack of comparison patient populations that must be addressed in future studies.

Blood-born lipids, like LDL involved in atherosclerosis and apolipoprotein-E4 (ApoE4) involved in dementia, may also be implicated in development of OP. We examined osteoblast cell lines as a culture model for OP by exposure to lipoproteins. ApoE expression in Saos2 and U2OS osteoblasts was confirmed by PCR. ApoE4 did decrease cell counts relatively to ApoE3, especially in Saos2 cells in which it was less selective for cells with higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP, an osteoblast marker) activity than ApoE3. This associates with ApoE4, being a risk factor for both dementia and OP. Saos2, but not U2OS, showed a decrease in cell counts after 48 h exposure to native LDL (NLDL). Both cell lines had decreased cell counts already after 24 h when exposed to oxidized-LDL (OxLDL) for which Saos2 also showed a higher sensitivity than U2OS. Exposure of Saos2 to both, OxLDL at low concentration (5 microg/ml) and NLDL revealed a shrunken size cell fraction of 17-23% on the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Such shrunken cell fraction was not seen when Saos2 cells were exposed to 50 microg/ml of OxLDL or to OxLDL combined with 10 nM dexamethasone (DEX, a stimulator of osteoprogenitor differentiation). DEX treatment has lysed the cells earlier than 24 h post exposure and has selected more resistant cells that did not show apoptotic shrinkage in the FACS analysis done after 24 h. We interpret this as a failure to detect the apoptotic cell fraction due to their lysis prior to the FACS analysis. Western blots performed at different time points (10 min, 30 min, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h) under OxLDL + DEX revealed a fall in the positive regulator of pp60Src-kinase phosphotyrosine (pY)418 relative to the DEX controls during the first 4 h. This is consistent with DEX osteogenic induction, known to be negatively regulated by c-Src, although the pY418/pY529 ratios (negative/positive kinase regulation) fell only at the 10 min time point. Contrarily the pY418/pY529 ratio increased, relative to untreated controls, under 5 microg/ml and 50 microg/ml of NLDL at the 4 h time point and under 50 microg/ml NLDL only at the 10 min time point, being consistent with the ability of a higher dose of LDL to antagonize osteoblast differentiation. This could be even more acceptable if the NLDL would have become minimally oxidized during its long purification procedure. Under NLDL, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was pro-apoptotic at 10 min, 30 min, and 4 h only under 50 microg/ml, whereas under OxLDL + DEX it was pro-apoptotic only after 4 h suggesting that additional pathways contribute to cell death.

DESIGN: A 5-year prospective follow-up study.
SETTING: Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University Hospital in Umeå, Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-eight nondemented patients aged 65 and older operated on for femoral neck fractures were followed for 5 years.
MEASUREMENTS: The patients were assessed using the Organic Brain Syndrome (OBS) Scale pre- and postoperatively. Medical and social data were collected from the patients, their caregivers, and medical records, and the survivors were visited and assessed with the OBS Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination in their homes 5 years after the fracture.
RESULTS: Thirty of 78 (38.5%) nondemented patients with a femoral neck fracture developed dementia within a 5-year period. Twenty of 29 (69%) who were delirious postoperatively developed dementia, compared with 10 of 49 (20%) who were not delirious during their hospital stay (P <.001).

To better understand the gait disturbance in PD and the factors that contribute to falls, we quantitatively evaluated: (1) the relationship between gait variability (a marker of fall risk in other populations), fall history, and other parkinsonian features, and (2) the effects of levodopa on these relationships.
METHODS: The average stride time and stride-to-stride variability were measured using force-sensitive insoles during comfortable walking. Fall frequency, motor control, function, and mental health were measured using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and the timed motor tests of the Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations (CAPIT) in 32 subjects with idiopathic PD, in an ""off"" (unmedicated) state and again in an ""on"" (medicated) state.
RESULTS: Average stride time was not associated with any UPDRS or CAPIT measure and was similar in fallers and non-fallers in ""off"" and ""on"" states (p>0.27). Stride time variability was significantly associated with fall frequency as well as with total scores on the CAPIT and the UPDRS, ADL abilities, and motor function. Stride time variability and falls were not related to tremor, rigidity or bradykinesia in the ""off"" state. 41% of subjects reported one or more falls. Stride time variability was 8.8+/-7.9% in fallers and 4.2+/-1.3% in non-fallers (p<0.009). Stride time variability significantly improved in response to levodopa, both in fallers and non-fallers, but remained increased in fallers (vs. non-fallers).
CONCLUSIONS: The patho-physiology responsible for impaired stride-to-stride regulation of gait timing is apparently independent of other cardinal features of PD, i.e., tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia, but is responsive to levodopa. Stride-to-stride variability is especially impaired among PD subjects with a history of falls, suggesting, for the first time, the possibility of exaggerated impairment of internal clock function in PD fallers.","2003",,"J Neurol Sci"," OBJECTIVES : Patients with Parkinson's disease ( PD ) have an increased risk of falling that has yet to be fully explained ","comparative study","Activities of Daily Living, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Antiparkinson Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Female, FALSE, Gait, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Gait Disorders, Neurologic, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Humans, FALSE, Levodopa, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neurologic Examination, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, FALSE, Reference Values, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

These hypertrophic changes were observed primarily in patients with a Hoehn-Yahr stage of 3-5. PD patients with hypertrophic IMC of the carotid artery also exhibited elevated plasma levels of Hcy associated with the C677T genotype of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Moreover, a prolonged duration of treatment with L-DOPA in patients with MTHFR T/T genotype enhanced the hypertrophy of IMC, compared with patients with the C/C or C/T genotype.

However, their pathophysiological basis is poorly understood. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) may provide the means to investigate early changes in brain metabolite concentrations. We examined the relationships between N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr) metabolite ratios in a voxel in the parietal cortex and cognitive function in 88 healthy, non-demented, unmedicated men aged 65-70 years. We also used linear regression to give a value for each metabolite adjusted for the levels of the other two metabolites. Both NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios correlated positively with tests of verbal memory and a verbal memory factor (e.g. NAA/Cr and Logical Memory: r = 0.24, P < 0.05). Cho/Cr ratios also correlated positively with tests of visual memory (e.g. visual reproduction: r = 0.21, P < 0.05). Adjusted Cr levels correlated negatively and significantly with tests of verbal memory and the Verbal Memory Factor. The regression analysis suggested that Cr levels better explained the correlations between NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios and cognitive variables than NAA or Cho levels. These results suggest that in healthy men aged 65-70 years, metabolite levels relate to cognitive performance.

We evaluated the cerebral white matter biochemical pattern in healthy older subjects, older patients with chronic hypertension, and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: University-affiliated outpatient clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy older subjects, 10 cognitively intact older patients with chronic hypertension, and 10 older patients with early AD.
MEASUREMENTS: All subjects underwent clinical examination, neuropsychological assessment, and 1H-MRS to measure N-acetylaspartate (NAA), myoinositol, choline, and creatine resonance signals in an 8-cm3 voxel located in the paratrigonal white matter region bilaterally. NAA/creatine, myoinositol/creatine, and choline/creatine ratios were measured, and the mean values were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey test for post hoc analysis.
RESULTS: A significantly higher mean myoinositol/creatine (ratio +/- standard deviation) was found in hypertensive patients (0.67 +/- 0.05) and in AD patients (0.68 +/- 0.08) than in controls (0.56 +/- 0.04) (P <.001).

RECENT FINDINGS: In Alzheimer's disease, recent advances have included the identification of behavioral profiles, differentiation of apathy and depression, characterization of risk factors for psychosis and its links to agitation and aggression, and an analysis of depressive symptoms in the absence of major depression. Functional neuroimaging data mainly supported the role of the anterior cingulate in apathy. The orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate tangle burden were associated with agitation, and increased orbitofrontal and mid-temporal muscarinic M2 receptors with psychosis and hallucinations. Selected genetic polymorphisms of dopamine and serotonin receptors or transporters were linked with aggression, hallucinations or psychosis. When compared with other dementias, individuals with frontotemporal dementia disclosed, as expected, different behaviors and particularly aberrant social behavior. The frequency of delusions and visual hallucinations was increased in Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting common mechanisms such as Lewy body pathology and cholinergic deficiency. The latter was supported by an improvement of these symptoms by cholinesterase inhibitors.
SUMMARY: Future research directions include both clinical and basic neuroscience investigations. The detection of early neuropsychiatric symptoms might be a marker for dementia, and the possible existence of a mild neuropsychiatric impairment syndrome should be explored. More longitudinal studies with pathological confirmation will facilitate correlations with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Functional neuroimaging and behavioral neurogenetics will permit in-vivo correlations and consequently help patient management and care.","2002",,"Curr Opin Neurol"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Neuropsychiatric , or non-cognitive symptoms are increasingly recognized as manifestations of dementias "," review","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Depression, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE, Psychotic Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Studies investigating the frequency of depression in PD have yielded figures ranging between 2.7% and 70%. Methodological differences account for much of the disparity. The aetiology of depression in PD is complex, and probably relates to both biological and exogenous factors. Dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system, may be involved. Mood disturbances resulting from deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus may provide a fruitful area for future research, and assist our understanding of the neural networks involved in mediating depression. Several recent studies have confirmed that depression in the PD patient is a major determinant of quality of life and that this is closely related to dysfunction in other clinically important health areas. The validity for many existing scales in the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of depression in the PD patient has not been established. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression appear to have good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared with DSM-IV criteria. Recommendations for the optimal drug treatment of depression in PD are difficult to give, due to an inexplicable dearth of sizeable, placebo-controlled studies. A majority of physicians would probably now opt for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the depressed PD patient. There is no good evidence that these drugs are associated with a worsening of motor features, but they should probably not be coprescribed with selegiline, because of the risk of causing a potentially serious serotonin syndrome. Several studies have suggested that depression in the PD patient is associated with a more rapid deterioration in cognitive and motor functions, perhaps as a surrogate marker for more extensive brainstem cell loss.","2002",,"Mov Disord",," review","Antidepressive Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Depressive Disorder, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, FALSE, Quality of Life, FALSE, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Treatment Outcome, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Systolic pressure was slightly increased in 2-month-old SHR in comparison with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and augmented progressively with age in SHR. No microanatomical changes were observed in the hippocampus of SHR of 2 months in comparison with age-matched WKY rats. A limited decrease of white matter volume was observed in 4-month-old SHR. In SHR of 6 months, a reduction of grey matter volume both in the CA1 subfield and in the dentate gyrus occurred.

In 6-month-old SHR, an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expression was found by Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in number (hyperplasia), but not in size of astrocytes. These findings indicate the occurrence of cytoskeletal breakdown and astroglial changes primarily in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus of SHR of 6 months.

LPS is a potent inducer of TNF-alpha, and both are increased in the chorioamniotic environment of women who have bacterial vaginosis (BV) during pregnancy, suggesting that BV might interfere with the normal development of fetal DA neurons.

Stereological cell counts in the mesencephalon were also significantly reduced (27%) by prenatal LPS exposure. Prenatal exposure to LPS, as might occur in humans with BV, produces a significant loss of THir cells in rats that is still present 33 days following a single injection of LPS.

Accumulation of excess cholesterol in hippocampal neurons promotes the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloidogenic components with the consequence of the acceleration of neuronal degeneration. Conversion of cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol mediated by cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46) is the major pathway for the elimination of brain cholesterol and the maintenance of brain cholesterol homeostasis. We examined whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 24S-hydroxycholesterol levels differ between patients with dementia, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively intact control subjects. Plasma and CSF concentrations of 24S-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol in 32 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 11 patients with vascular dementia, seven patients with MCI, and seven cognitively intact control subjects were measured by combined gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry. We show elevated concentrations of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the CSF of AD patients and we interpret this finding as a consequence of increased cholesterol turnover in the central nervous system during neurodegeneration. The observed influence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) allele on CSF 24S-hydroxycholesterol concentrations with a gene-dosage effect suggests the existence of a link between the AD risk factor APOE4 and CNS cholesterol metabolism. The elevation of CSF 24S-hydroxycholesterol appears to occur early in the disease process, since patients with mild cognitive impairment had also increased CSF concentrations of this compound.

Demonstration that constipation can precede clinical PD could provide important clues to understanding disease progression and etiology. The purpose of this report is to examine the association between the frequency of bowel movements and the future risk of PD.
METHODS: Information on the frequency of bowel movements was collected from 1971 to 1974 in 6790 men aged 51 to 75 years without PD in the Honolulu Heart Program. Follow-up for incident PD occurred over a 24-year period.
RESULTS: Ninety-six men developed PD an average of 12 years into follow-up. Age-adjusted incidence declined consistently from 18.9/10,000 person-years in men with <1 bowel movement/day to 3.8/10,000 person-years in those with >2/day (p = 0.005). After adjustment for age, pack-years of cigarette smoking, coffee consumption, laxative use, jogging, and the intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains, men with <1 bowel movement/day had a 2.7-fold excess risk of PD versus men with 1/day (95% CI: 1.3, 5.5; p = 0.007).

,"11374223","[Cardiology 2000].","Jerie P","In cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, the main focus is now on statins (HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors) because of their antihyperlipidaemic and antiatherogenic effect. They are suggested to be beneficial also in senile dementia, stroke and osteoporosis and they can reduce incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with cardioverter-defibrillator. In chronic heart failure, statins should be used with caution since reduced cholesterol levels relate to impaired survival. As an alternative to statins and fibrates, niacin therapy may be considered. ACE inhibitors are of proven benefit for patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction; however, in long-term treatment, their protective activity is not superior to that of beta-blockers, diuretics and clonidine. Ca-channel antagonists slightly increase the incidence of cardiovascular complications but reduce the incidence of stroke in high-risk patients. Biventricular pacing has been used with success in patients with severe heart failure and conduction disturbances, and the first permanent artificial ventricle was implanted to a patient with irreversible terminal heart failure in summer 2000. Cardiospecific troponin I may be an uninvasive marker of a procoagulant status indicating e.g. graft failure after cardiac transplantation; T-cadherin belongs to the cell-adhesion molecules and has a role in maintenance of cellular contacts which are critical for the vessel wall architecture.

Affected individuals have migraine, mood disturbance, and recurrent strokes, often progressing to subcortical dementia and premature death. MRI findings include focal lacunar infarcts and diffuse T2-weighted hyperintensity, or leukoaraiosis. However, such findings are seen much more commonly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, particularly hypertension, where they are believed to represent cerebral small vessel disease. No previous study has sought to identify specific radiologic markers of CADASIL.
METHODS: MRI scans from 20 consecutive patients with CADASIL and 20 patients with sporadic leukoaraiosis due to presumed small-vessel disease were compared using the previously validated semiquantitative MRI rating scale devised by Scheltens et al. Analysis was blinded to clinical category.
RESULTS: Scores for hyperintensities of the temporal white matter and external capsule-insula region were significantly higher in patients with CADASIL. Hyperintensity confined to the pole of the temporal lobe was a characteristic finding in CADASIL, occurring in 19 patients with CADASIL but no patients with ischemic leukoaraiosis. Involvement of the external capsule, though less specific, was seen early in the disease course. In a few patients with CADASIL, involvement of the corpus callosum was observed.

Some healthy adults with the same echo characteristics showed a reduced 18fluorodopa uptake on PET, indicating a subclinical alteration of the nigrostriatal system.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the sonographic phenotype of hyperechogenic SN has any relevance for motor function in elderly subjects and whether an increased echogenicity of the SN is associated with an impaired motor function.
METHOD: In a population-based, cross-sectional study, 93 subjects older then 60 years without history of extrapyramidal disorder underwent sonographic and neurologic examinations, with a quantitative motor assessment.
RESULTS: Elderly healthy subjects without prediagnosed extrapyramidal disorder but with SN hyperechogenicity had more frequent and more severe parkinsonian symptoms and a slower finger tapping than those with a regular echogenicity of the SN (p < 0.05, U test).
CONCLUSION: With increasing age, subjects with SN hyperechogenicity develop a more substantial slowing of movements than subjects without this echo pattern, stressing the functional relevance of this sonographic finding.

Nef expression has been detected in HIV infected human brains with neuronal damage [A. Ranki, M. Nyberg, V. Ovod, M. Haltia, I. Elovaara, R. Raininko, H. Haapsalo, K.

It is postulated that nef may contribute to the neuronal damage observed in the brain of those with late HIV disease. To test this, the potential toxicity of recombinant nef (from HIV-1 IIIB) was compared to the neurotoxin human tumour necrosis alpha (TNFalpha) on human brain cells in culture. SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, primary human neurons and glial cells were exposed to recombinant nef or TNFalpha protein for 3 days or twice over 6 days. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan Blue, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and MTT assays. Nuclear fragmentation was detected using the Hoechst Blue nuclear dye assay. Both nef and TNFalpha (100 ng/ml) caused a significant 30% reduction of SK-N-SH cell numbers after 3 days exposure (P=0. 001). At this time, exposure to nef caused evident fragmented nuclei in these cultures. Human neuronal cultures had a 32 and 33% decrease in cell number after 6 days exposure to either nef or TNFalpha, respectively (P<0.001). Furthermore, as previously shown [J. He, C.M. DeCastro, G.R.

With the advent of symptomatic treatment at present and probable etiology-based cures in the future, it will be possible to relieve and put an end to these negative effects. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose the disease as early as possible. In this review, we briefly summarize the state-of-the-art concerning various available clinical and biochemical methods for identifying AD. Increasing age, heritage, and presence of ApoE e4 allele have been confirmed as risk factors for AD as well as some putative factors (e.g., low education, hypertension, hypotension) based on epidemiological recent research. Selective impairment of episodic memory has been found to be a preclinical marker for future development of AD based on convergent data from asymptomatic AD-related mutation carriers, longitudinal studies of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and epidemiological studies of incident AD cases. Neurophysiological methods are inexpensive and useful for the identification of changes in brain dysfunction in AD and new promising methods are under development. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRT), structural measurements of brain atrophy and specific brain structures such as the hippocampus have been reported to detect dementia development early in the course of disease. Similarly, functional measurements of brain activity (e.g., blood flow) have revealed that hypometabolism in bilateral parietotemporal brain areas early in the disease course. Finally, biochemical studies have demonstrated that certain proteins (e.g., tau the A beta 1-42/43 metabolite of the amyloid precursor protein) may be associated with the disease process in AD, although the specificity of these markers remains to be established. It is concluded that still no single marker of AD exists, which makes it necessary to rely on data from multiple sources in order to arrive at the best possible diagnosis of AD.","1999",,"Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci",," review","Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Alleles, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Biomarkers, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Carrier Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Electroencephalography, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Point Mutation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Radiography, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The number of different animal species was smaller with case subjects as was the duration of animal contacts. Case subjects found their work physically heavier and exercised more. The mean age at onset in ever-smoking men was significantly higher than in never-smoking men. No special reason for non-smoking increased, and a physical reason decreased the risk of PD. Area of birth or living, farming and other occupations, types of drinking water, pesticide and herbicide use, head injuries, use of alcohol, education, and carbon monoxide poisonings were similar among case subjects and control subjects.

As we have no treatment to offer patients with genetic risk factors, genotyping for ApoE-4 is at present of no clinical use. Trained neuropsychologists have today access to sensitive tests which reveal cognitive impairment before the disturbances reach the level of dementia. Laboratory investigations of cerebrospinal fluid have so far yielded no great results. Tau protein appears to be the most sensitive marker, but it is unspecific.

This is in agreement with the fact that prothrombin is a cofactor for most aPL registered as LA. Comparison of two subgroups of aPL patients different by dominant antigenic specificity (18 patients with aPT but free of ACL and 6 patients with aCP but free of aPT) demonstrated that the latter developed disorders of cerebral circulation, head ache, dementia and renal syndrome less frequently. aPT in Sneddon's syndrome seems to be a marker of comparatively low risk of thrombosis and less severe course of the disease.","1998",,"Klin Med (Mosk)",,"comparative study","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Antibodies, Anticardiolipin, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Antibodies, Antiphospholipid, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Biomarkers, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Immunoenzyme Techniques, FALSE, Immunoglobulin G, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Lupus Coagulation Inhibitor, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prothrombin, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Sneddon Syndrome, TRUE, etiology, Q000209",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

,"9359935","Role of homocysteine in age-related vascular and non-vascular diseases.","Parnetti L","Homocysteine (Hcy) may represent a metabolic link in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular diseases and old-age dementias. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease, and is also associated with cerebrovascular disease; specifically, the risk of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis significantly increases in relation to Hcy levels. Hcy is a reliable marker of vitamin B12 deficiency, a common condition in the elderly which is known to induce neurological deficits including cognitive impairment; a high prevalence of folate deficiency has been reported in psychogeriatric patients suffering from depression and dementia. Both these vitamins occupy a key position in the remethylation and synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a major methyl donor in CNS; therefore, deficiencies in either of these vitamins lead to a decrease in SAMe and increase in Hcy, which can be critical in the aging brain. Another pathogenetic mechanism linking high Hcy levels to reduced cognitive performances in the elderly might be represented by excitotoxicity, since hyperhomocysteinemia may lead to an excessive production of homocysteic acid and cysteine sulphinic acid, which act as endogenous agonists of NMDA receptors. Considering the reasonably high prevalence in the general population of a genetic predisposition to a thermolabile form of the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), hyperhomocysteinemia can be seen as the result of multiple genetic and environmental factors leading to vascular and/or neurodegenerative disorders where age-related involutive phenomena represent a common pathogenetic ground. Systematic studies in different psychogeriatric conditions monitoring Hcy levels and clinical features before and after vitamin supplementation are therefore highly recommended.","1997",,"Aging (Milano)",," review","Aged, FALSE, Aging, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Alcoholism, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Central Nervous System, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cerebrovascular Disorders, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Cognition, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Coronary Disease, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Depression, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Estrogens, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Folic Acid Deficiency, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Homocysteine, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, Kidney Failure, Chronic, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Male, FALSE, Methylation, FALSE, Peripheral Vascular Diseases, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Renal Replacement Therapy, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Vascular Diseases, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Vitamin B 12 Deficiency, FALSE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

We performed the present study to determine whether dementia diagnosed three months after stroke onset is an independent risk factor for long-term stroke recurrence.
METHODS: We examined 242 patients (age = 72.0 +/- 8.7 years) hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke who had survived the first three months without recurrence and followed them to identify predictors of long-term stroke recurrence. We diagnosed dementia three months after stroke using modified DSM-III-R criteria based on neuropsychological and functional assessments. The effects of conventional stroke risk factors and dementia status on survival free of recurrence were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses, and the relative risks (RR) of recurrence were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Dementia (RR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.36 to 5.42); cardiac disease (RR = 2.18, CI = 1.15 to 4.12); and sex, with women at higher risk (RR = 2.03, CI = 1.01 to 4.10), were significant independent predictors of recurrence, while education (RR = 1.90, CI = 0.77 to 4.68), admission systolic blood pressure >160 mm Hg (RR = 1.80, CI = 0.94 to 3.44) and alcohol intake exceeding 160 grams per week (RR = 1.86, CI = 0.79 to 4.38) were weakly related.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that dementia significantly increases the risk of long-term stroke recurrence, with additional independent contributions by cardiac disease and sex. Cognitive impairment may be a surrogate marker for multiple vascular risk factors and larger infarct volume that may serve to increase the risk of recurrence. Alternatively, less aggressive medical management of stroke patients with cognitive impairment or noncompliance of such patients with medical therapy may be bases for an increased rate of stroke recurrence.","1997",,"Neurology",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cerebrovascular Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Dementia, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Female, FALSE, Heart Diseases, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multivariate Analysis, FALSE, Recurrence, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sex Factors, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Compared against the risk for AD with no history of depression and no epsilon 4 allele, the risk ratio for AD with two epsilon 4 alleles was 2.87 (C.I. = 1.56-5.28), with one epsilon 4 allele, 1.82 (C.I. = 1.09-3.04) and with late-onset depression and no epsilon 4 allele, 2.95 (C.I. = 1.55-5.62). There was no suggestion of an interaction between prior depression and APOE genotype in their effects on AD risk. Results were similar when the sample was stratified by twin pair, so that a single genetic marker is unlikely to explain the relation among depression, APOE, and dementia.

This study was designed to address these issues and other aspects of familial aggregation of the disorder. A consecutive sample of 1,694 patients who met criteria for a diagnosis of probable or definite AD were ascertained in 13 centers participating in the Multi-Institutional Research in Alzheimer Genetic Epidemiology (MIRAGE) project. Lifetime risk and age at onset of AD among various strata of 12,971 first-degree relatives was estimated using survival analysis procedures. The lifetime risk of AD in first-degree relatives was 39.0% +/- 2.1% by age 96 years. Age-specific risk of AD declined after age 90 and the data set included 61 apparently unaffected persons who survived to age 96 without becoming demented. Female relatives had a higher risk of AD than male relatives at all ages. By age 80, children of conjugal AD couples had a cumulative risk of 54%, 1.5 times greater than the sum of the risks to children having affected mothers or fathers, and nearly 5 times greater than the risk to children having normal parents. Children of affected fathers had a cumulative risk that was 1.4 times the corresponding risk to children of affected mothers. Risk assessment in early-onset and late-onset families, using various strategies for determining the age cut-off, yielded contradictory results. These data suggest the following: (1) the lifetime risk among relatives does not support a simple autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of disease; (2) women are innately more susceptible to AD than men; (3) the proportion of hereditary cases may be higher in men than women; (4) distinction between early- onset and late-onset forms of AD has little meaning in the absence of a biological marker; (5) the risk of AD decreases after age 90; and (6) AD therefore may not be an inevitable concomitant of the aging process, a conclusion that has profound implications for basic and applied AD research.

BACKGROUND: In adults with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a shortest RR interval <220 ms during atrial fibrillation is a sensitive marker for sudden death. However, because reliance on the shortest RR interval has a low positive predictive value, the clinical history has assumed a pivotal role in assessing risk. This approach has not been evaluated in children.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 60 children </= 18 years old who underwent comprehensive electrophysiologic evaluation between 1979 and 1989 before undergoing operation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Clinical and electrophysiologic data were analyzed after patients had been grouped by their clinical presentation: high risk (cardiac arrest), intermediate risk (syncope or atrial fibrillation) or low risk (orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia alone).
RESULTS: Ten children had a clinical cardiac arrest (high risk); only one had a prior history of syncope or atrial fibrillation. Compared with the intermediate (n = 19) and low risk groups (n = 31), there were no differences in age ([mean +/- SD] 14.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.5 +/- 1.7 years), duration of symptoms (1.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.2 +/- .08 years), incidence of congenital heart disease (30% vs 26% vs 32%), presence of multiple pathways (20% vs 16% vs 16%) or accessory pathway location. A shortest pre-excited RR interval <220 ms was found in 7 of 7 high risk patients (sensitivity 100%), 14 of 19 intermediate risk patients and 11 of 31 low risk patients (prevalence 35%).
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac arrest was the only distinguishing clinical feature between high and low risk groups and the first manifestation in 80% of the children of an accessory pathway that can precipitate a life-threatening arrhythmia. In this series, the largest reported to date of children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome having a cardiac arrest, a shortest pre-excited RR interval <220 ms was more sensitive than clinical history for identifying those at risk for sudden death.","1996",,"J Am Coll Cardiol"," OBJECTIVES : This study sought to determine whether the clinical and electrophysiologic criteria developed in adults also identify children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at risk for sudden death ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Death, Sudden, Cardiac, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Electrocardiography, TRUE, Electrophysiology, FALSE, Heart Conduction System, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Humans, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Medical History Taking, TRUE, Prognosis, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE, Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, FALSE, complications, Q000150",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

The high rate of success of radiofrequency energy ablation have transformed catheter ablation from an investigational procedure into the first-line therapy for symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Radiofrequency catheter ablation for preexcitation syndrome is commonly based on a ventricular approach. Such an approach might be associated with the risk of prolonged arterial catheter manipulation, retrograde left ventricular catheterization, and production of multiple, potentially arrhythmogenic, ventricular lesions created during ablation. Potential risks can be avoided using atrial insertion ablation procedures. The transseptal procedure that was developed in the 1950s and 1960s as a diagnostic procedure and then shelved in the 1970s and early 1980s has now come back into prominence as a therapeutic technique in the treatment of valvular heart disease, and then in the ablation of the left accessory atrioventricular connections.
METHODS: Atrial aspect of mitral annulus is a relatively smooth, nonobstructed surface that simplifies catheter movement, thereby permitting rapid and accurate accessory pathway location. Although primary use of earliest endocardial retrograde atrial activation as a marker of accessory pathway atrial insertion is sufficiently accurate to permit successful ablation, direct recording of an accessory pathway potential is an important predictor of successful ablation site. Moreover, the analysis of the unipolar atrial electrogram, recorded during sinus rhythm from the tip of the ablation catheter, provides further information for localizing the atrial insertion of the accessory pathways. Shortest atrial-accessory pathway and negative delta-accessory pathway intervals have been found to be the best predictors of the successful site.
RESULTS: A 90.5% success of the transseptal approach on an overall population of 328 patients, higher for overt than for concealed pathways, is comparable with the results of the retrograde. Complications are 0.5%.

Primary correlates of Alzheimer's disease are a dysfunction of and a subsequent decrease in the number of cortical and hippocampal synapses, followed by neurofibrillary and neuritic changes of hippocampal and cortical neurons. While the synapse pathology has been shown to be an early event in Alzheimer's disease, a significant neurofibrillary and neuritic pathology appears to develop only during the course of the disease. Cortical amyloid deposits are an unspecific, age-related phenomenon that can also be found in the brains of the majority of nondemented elderly persons over the age of 65 years. Transgenic amyloid mice proved to be of only limited value as animal models of Alzheimer' disease. According to several studies, there is no correlation between the total number of cortical amyloid plaques and clinical parameters of dementia. However, such a correlation exists with respect to the proportion of neuritic plaques, i.e., with respect to the degree of neuritic degeneration within plaques. In addition to these changes, an interleukin-6 associated inflammatory response has been found in the cortices of Alzheimer patients which is absent in the brains of nondemented elderly persons, and which therefore appears to be a specific element. The significance of changes in the cholinergic neurotransmission for Alzheimer's disease is discussed. Finally, the role of apolipoprotein E and other genetic risk factors is reviewed. In this context it is emphasized that in young persons apolipoprotein E4 is not a suitable early diagnostic marker for Alzheimer's disease.","1995",,"Z Gerontol Geriatr","The aim of this article is to review the pathogenetic factors of Alzheimer's disease "," review","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Amyloid, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Animals, FALSE, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Cholinergic Fibers, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Hippocampus, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Humans, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Neurofibrillary Tangles, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Synapses, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

DESIGN: Magnetic resonance imaging data on patients with PD and normal subjects were compared as to frequency, extent, and topographic location of white matter hyperintensities; moreover, in the PD group, we studied the possible correlation of white matter hyperintensities with clinical features such as severity, disease duration, and therapy.
SETTING: The outpatient clinic of the Institute of Clinical Neurology and the Neuroradiology Unit of the University of Pisa (Italy).
PATIENTS: We studied 102 nondemented patients with idiopathic PD and 68 sex- and age-matched healthy controls, all screened for absence of cerebrovascular risk factors.
OUTCOME MEASURES: White matter hyperintensities were classified as periventricular hyperintensities and deep hyperintensities. Frequency, extent, and topographic location of both periventricular and deep hyperintensities were evaluated. The clinical parameters examined were disease duration, treatment type, and disease severity (using Hoehn and Yahr staging and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), as well as disease progression index (ratio between Hoehn and Yahr stage and disease duration).
RESULTS: The frequency and the extent of periventricular hyperintensities were significantly higher in patients with PD than in healthy subjects. Moreover, within the PD group, the patients who had periventricular hyperintensities had significantly shorter disease duration and greater disease severity, ie, a higher disease progression index, than those who did not.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Education-adjusted scores on several neuropsychological tests were compared in twins discordant for the apoE epsilon 4 allele. Subjects with documented cerebrovascular disease were excluded.
RESULTS: Among 20 fraternal twin pairs discordant for the presence of epsilon 4, twins with the epsilon 4 allele demonstrated poorer mean performance than their co-twins without the epsilon 4 allele.

Seventy-two (40.7%) of the patients were disoriented 7-10 days after stroke and 39 patients (22.0% of the sample) remained disoriented 3 months later. A logistic regression analysis determined that persistent disorientation was significantly related to stroke status [odds ratio (OR) = 5.8], after adjusting for memory and attentional deficits and demographic variables. Among stroke patients, disorientation was associated with severe hemispheral stroke syndromes (OR = 7.7), but not infarct location or vascular risk factor history, after adjusting for memory and attentional deficits and demographic variables. Sensitivity and specificity analyses determined that disorientation was an inaccurate marker for dementia or deficits in memory or attention, while intact orientation was associated with a low probability of dementia or memory dysfunction in most patients but not preserved attention.

Thus enormous international scientific efforts are being made to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, with the eventual goal of developing beneficial therapy. The two major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extracellular senile plaques, the principal component of which is the A beta amyloid peptide, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which are composed of aggregated tau protein in the form of paired helical filaments (PHF). In the past decade, since the major proteinaceous components of these pathological markers have been identified, great strides have been made in elucidating the biochemical processes which may underlie their abnormal deposition and aggregation in Alzheimer's disease. Simultaneously, extensive population genetic analyses have identified mutations in the A beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) in a small number of pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) whilst other FAD cases have been linked to an, as yet, unidentified marker on chromosome 14. Most recently, inheritance of the type 4 allele of apolipoprotein E has also been identified as a risk factor in sporadic AD.

OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical features, etiology, diagnosis, and management of delirium in elderly hospitalized patients.
SUMMARY: Delirium can be caused by primary intracranial disease, systemic diseases, withdrawal from alcohol or sedative hypnotic agents, or drug intoxication, the most common cause. Because delirium may present with diverse clinical features, physicians should suspect it in any elderly patient with a change in mental status, personality, or behavior. Bedside screening tools may help distinguish delirium from dementia and psychosis. Causative factors should be sought and removed or treated. Anticholinergic drugs are the worst offenders, but all drugs are suspect and should be discontinued or reduced in dosage. If a sedative is needed, haloperidol is the drug of choice. Because of the prevalence and seriousness of alcohol withdrawal, all delirious patients should receive intravenous thiamine to reduce the risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy.

In demented subjects of 80 years of age or older, the frequency of HpScl was even higher, 26%. Cases with HpScl had significantly fewer hippocampal senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and parahippocampal NFT than cases without HpScl, but did not differ significantly in any of the other measured pathological parameters. Enzyme-linked analysis of synaptic protein immunoreactivity in a subset of 33 cases demonstrated significant decreases in the hippocampus, but not in frontal, temporal, parietal or parahippocampal cortices. All but 1 of the cases with HpScl had Blessed information, memory and concentration scores (BIMC) of 8 or more, and all were considered to be demented. In some patients memory disturbance was disproportionate to deficits in other cognitive areas. All but 4 of the cases with HpScl had many non-neuritic, amyloid plaques in the neocortex meeting NIA criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, given the advanced age of the subjects, amyloid plaques were considered to represent age-related cerebral amyloid deposition (""pathological aging"") in most cases. Only 3 cases had both many SP and NFT in multiple cortical regions consistent with AD. Another case had brain stem and cortical Lewy bodies consistent with diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD). A few ballooned neurons were present in the limbic cortices in 3 cases, including one case of dementia with argyrophilic grains (DAG) in limbic and orbital frontal and temporal cortices. The 8 cases without AD, DLBD or DAG included 4 cases in which no other obvious cause of dementia was detected and 4 cases in which HpScl was accompanied by either multiple cerebral infarcts or leukoencephalopathy, or both, that could have contributed to dementia. Patients with HpScl had risk factors, clinical signs and post-mortem pathological findings of cardiovascular disease, but due to the high prevalence of these conditions in very old humans, no significant correlation with HpScl was detected. This study demonstrates that HpScl is a common post-mortem finding in demented, but not normal, elderly subjects.

Frequent symptoms in supraventricular tachycardias are palpitations, dizziness or dyspnea. Syncope is more uncommon, however, if a sensation of rapid heart beat precedes a syncope, a causal relationship between arrhythmia and syncope has to be considered. When the surface ECG shows no abnormalities, Holter monitoring or exercise testing usually fail to record a suspected tachycardia, therefore, electrophysiologic study should be performed to verify the underlying arrhythmia. In patients with unexplained syncope supraventricular arrhythmias can be established in up to 15% of patients. However, interpretation of electrophysiologic results has to be performed carefully because functional abnormalities like dual AV nodal pathways can be found in up to 10% of asymptomatic patients. The prognostic value of syncope as a marker for rapid tachycardia or sudden cardiac death is still in discussion.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of visual impairment was higher in cases than in controls [unadjusted odds ratio for near-vision impairment = 2.7 (95% CI = 1.4, 5.2); unadjusted odds ratio for far-vision impairment = 2.1 (95% CI = 1.02, 4.3); odds ratios adjusted for family history of dementia, depression, number of medications, and hearing loss were 2.5 (95% CI = 1.1, 10.5) for near-vision impairment and 1.9 (95% CI = 0.8, 4.6) for far-vision impairment].

Early diagnosis of ATD is still rather difficult. We recently have found that alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-ACT) increases significantly in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid in ATD. Thus, alpha 1-ACT can be used as an antemortem biological marker of ATD. Positron emission CT (PET) is also useful for the early diagnosis of ATD, because decrease in CMRO2 in the unilateral temporo-parietal region occurs in a relatively early stage of this disease. On the other hand, vascular dementia can be said to be becoming one of the treatable or preventable dementias. Vascular dementia is mainly based on cerebral infarction. Therefore, prevention of initial stroke is most essential. For this purpose, correction of risk factors and use of antiplatelet agents in those cases suffering a transient ischemic attack or subjective symptoms are necessary.","1990",,"Nihon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi"," For this purpose , correction of risk factors and use of antiplatelet agents in those cases suffering a transient ischemic attack or subjective symptoms are necessary "," review","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Dementia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Dementia, Vascular, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"
,"2329250","Postantibiotic colonization with Clostridium difficile in nursing home patients.","Thomas DR","Clostridium difficile causes pseudomembranous colitis and is responsible for 20% to 25% of cases of postantibiotic diarrhea. In an earlier study, nursing-home patients with C. difficile infection were noted to have a high mortality rate. Because most of these infected patients had been treated with antibiotics, it was not clear whether this high mortality rate was associated with C. difficile infection or simply with antibiotic treatment. A prospective study was carried out to determine the rate of postantibiotic C. difficile colonization and risk factors for infection in patients in a 233-bed long-term care facility, as well as to determine whether C. difficile infection is associated with increased mortality. During a six-month period 150 courses of antibiotics were prescribed for 108 patients. Stool specimens were collected from 36 (33%) patients following the first course of antibiotic treatment, and 12 (33%) were infected with C. difficile. Risk factors for infection included ward location and stool incontinence. Age, body-mass index less than or equal to 18 kg/m2, and diagnoses of dementia and pressure scores tended to be associated with infection, but not significantly. Early mortality rates did not differ, but 12-month mortality for the infected patients was higher (83% vs 50%, P = .05). Therefore, we conclude that postantibiotic C. difficile infection serves as a marker of death in nursing-home patients, one that can be differentiated from the risk of antibiotic treatment alone. This increased death rate may be related in part to clinically unrecognized pseudomembranous colitis or, alternatively, to absorption of C. difficile toxins or even endotoxin from the gut lumen into the systemic circulation.","1990",,"J Am Geriatr Soc",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Anti-Bacterial Agents, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Clostridium Infections, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Diarrhea, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Feces, FALSE, microbiology, Q000382, Female, FALSE, Homes for the Aged, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nursing Homes, TRUE, Prevalence, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Survival Rate, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

In the young, the annual mortality rate from sudden death is even higher, approximately 6%, but the prognostic significance of arrhythmia is unknown. To determine the prevalence of arrhythmia and its relation to prognosis, 2 days of ECG monitoring was performed in 6 infants, 14 children and 33 adolescents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy receiving no cardioactive medications. An additional 1 to 9 days (median 2) of monitoring was performed in 29 patients. All patients had sinus rhythm; 4 adolescents had episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, a child with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome had symptomatic reentrant atrioventricular tachycardia and 5 adolescents had asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. During follow-up of 1 week to 7 years (median 3 years), five patients died suddenly and two had successful resuscitation from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation; none of these seven patients had ventricular arrhythmias during 2 to 7 days (median 3) of ECG monitoring.

,"3625988","Senile dementia of the Binswanger type. A vascular form of dementia in the elderly.","Román GC","Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the elderly have demonstrated the common occurrence of deep white-matter lesions in the aging brain. These radiologic lesions (leukoaraiosis) may represent an early marker of dementia. At autopsy, an ischemic periventricular leukoencephalopathy (Binswanger's disease) has been found in most cases. The clinical spectrum of Binswanger's disease appears to range from asymptomatic radiologic lesions to dementia with focal deficits, frontal signs, pseudobulbar palsy, gait difficulties, and urinary incontinence. The name senile dementia of the Binswanger type (SDBT) is proposed for this poorly recognized, vascular form of subcortical dementia. The SDBT probably results from cortical disconnection most likely caused by hypoperfusion. In contrast, multi-infarct dementia is correlated with multiple large and small strokes that cause a loss of over 50 to 100 mL of brain volume. The periventricular white matter is a watershed area irrigated by long, penetrating medullary arteries. Risk factors for SDBT are small-artery diseases, such as hypertension and amyloid angiopathy, impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in the elderly, and periventricular hypoperfusion due to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and hypotension. The SDBT may be a potentially preventable and treatable form of dementia.","1987",,"JAMA",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Cerebral Arterial Diseases, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Dementia, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, FALSE, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Clinical genetic implications of age-dependent onset.","Breitner JC","A biomathematical genetic model for the age-specific risk of Alzheimer Dementia (AD) was applied to two problems in the clinical genetics of this disorder. In a test of the ability of a clinical marker specifically to identify genetic AD, cases grouped by the phenotype of amnesia with aphasia or apraxia (aaa) were shown to have familial risk that suggested a pure genetic illness, and differed significantly (p = 0.006) from cases without this phenotype. The model was also used in a Bayesian paradigm to assess the probability that individual cases had hereditary disease, given their family history. Here the results were surprisingly ambiguous: Even with no affected relatives, there is a substantial likelihood that many AD cases may have a genetic illness. Hence, one cannot reliably classify individual cases as ""familial"" or ""sporadic"" from family history alone. The phenotype of aaa (or other suitable marker) appears to be more reliable than the degree of manifest familial aggregation as an indicator of genetic AD.","1986",,"J Psychiatr Res",,"other","Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Amnesia, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Aphasia, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Apraxias, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Genes, Dominant, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mathematics, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Models, Genetic, FALSE, Phenotype, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

Cases of Parkinson's disease were identified from responses to mailed questionnaires and death certificates through 1978. Four controls from the same population were selected for each case. A reduced risk of Parkinson's disease was associated with most childhood viral infections. The negative association was statistically significant for a history of measles prior to college entrance (exposure odds ratio = 0.53; 95% confidence limits: 0.31, 0.93). The reduced risk of Parkinson's disease among subjects with a positive history of measles in childhood may reflect an adverse effect of measles in adulthood or of subclinical or atypical measles. Furthermore, a negative history of measles, especially if associated with a lack of other common diseases, could be a marker for negative influenza history before 1918 and thus a higher risk of infection during the 1918 influenza epidemic, because of the lack of partial influenza immunity. These data may also suggest a truly protective effect of measles, compatible with some complex interaction between measles virus and the virus of the 1918 influenza epidemic.","1985",,"Am J Epidemiol",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Death Certificates, FALSE, Epidemiologic Methods, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Influenza, Human, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Massachusetts, FALSE, Measles, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Pennsylvania, FALSE, Regression Analysis, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE",1,"projTutoParkinson","2023-12-28"

With the exception of the Kidd system, no significant differences were found in blood group frequencies nor in immunoglobulin allotypes between ALS patients, PD patients, and unaffected controls. The dermatoglyphic analysis demonstrated that ALS patients had higher frequencies of palmar patterns and accessory triradii in the IV interdigital area, and PD patients had significantly higher frequencies of complete simian creases and of palmar patterns in the thenar/I interdigital area than unaffected controls.
