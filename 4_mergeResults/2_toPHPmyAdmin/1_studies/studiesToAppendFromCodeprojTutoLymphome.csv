To address this issue, we evaluated the impact of reducing chemotherapy dose intensity by 25% and adding rituximab on outcomes in pediatric B-NHL.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients, less than 18 years of age with group B and C disease as per the Lymphome Malin de Burkitt (LMB) risk stratification were enrolled between September 2017 and October 2022. The LMB-89 protocol, with a 25% reduction in all chemotherapy doses and the addition of rituximab, was administered. The response was assessed using positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) after four cycles of chemotherapy (interim) and at the end of treatment.
RESULTS: The study included 25 patients with a median age of 6.9 years, among whom 20 (80%) were males. Twenty patients had group B and five had group C disease. Complete metabolic response (CMR) was achieved by 22/25 (88%) patients, and three (12%) achieved partial metabolic response (PMR) in the interim PET/CT. At the end of treatment, 22/24 (92%) patients achieved CMR, one had PMR, and one had progressive disease. The median follow-up was 45 months (range: 3-71 months). The 4-year event-free survival and overall survival were 88% and 92%, respectively. There were two deaths, one due to disease progression and the other due to sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates a significant improvement in outcomes in pediatric B-NHL compared to previous reports from LMICs, achieved through a 25% reduction in chemotherapy dose intensity and the addition of rituximab.","2023",,"Pediatr Blood Cancer","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Pediatric B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas ( NHL ) in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) have historically had inferior outcomes due to higher treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) and relapses ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"
,"37247203","Thrombotic Risk Assessment in Patients with Lymphoid Neoplasm seen at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, Anambra State.","Chilaka UJ","BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a cause of increased morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. VTE is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Risk assessment models have been developed to identify patients at risk of VTE for thromboprophylaxis. Risk scores of patients in our environment have not been adequately investigated.
OBJECTIVE: The study evaluates the association of thrombotic risk assessment scores (using the modified Khorana risk assessment tool) and soluble P-selectin levels with thrombotic events in patients with lymphoid cancer.
METHODS: This is a comparative cross-sectional study conducted at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH, Nnewi, Anambra State). Forty-five patients with lymphoid malignancy and 45 apparently healthy subjects participated in the study. The modified Khorana risk assessment score was used to assess cancer-associated thrombotic risk. Blood sample was collected for soluble P-selectin estimation. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 23.
RESULTS: The age of subjects with lymphoid neoplasm and controls were 49.1±15.8 years, and 49.6±11.1 years respectively (p = 0.548). Subjects with lymphoid neoplasm consist of 26 (57.8%) males and 19 (42.2%) females while the controls consist of 25 (55.6%) males and 20 (44.4%) females. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most frequent of lymphoid neoplasm (18, 40.0%), followed by multiple myeloma (10, 22%), CLL (9, 20%), ALL (6, 13.0%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (2, 4.0%). Thirty-five (77.8%) subjects with lymphoid neoplasm had intermediate risk scores and 10 (22.2%) had high-risk scores. Nineteen (42.2%) of the controls had intermediate risk and 26 (57.8%) low risk. The differences in proportion were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The median (IQR) levels of soluble P-selectin were significantly higher in patients with lymphoid neoplasm (12.2 vs. 7.0ng/mL, p <0.001). Three (6.6%) patients with lymphoid malignancies had deep vein thrombosis confirmed by a Doppler ultrasound scan.
CONCLUSION: Les tumeurs malignes lymphoïdes sont associées à des scores de risque thrombotique, des taux de sP-sélectine et des événements thromboemboliques veineux relativement plus élevés.
CONTEXTE: La thromboembolie veineuse (TEV) est une cause de morbidité et de mortalité accrues chez les patients atteints de cancer. La TEV est la deuxième cause de décès chez les patients atteints de cancer. Des modèles d’évaluation des risques ont été mis au point pour identifier les patients présentant un risque de TEV en vue d’une thromboprophylaxie. Les scores de risque des patients dans notre environnement n’ont pas été étudiés de manière adéquate.
OBJECTIF: L’étude évalue l’association des scores d’évaluation du risque thrombotique (en utilisant l’outil modifié d’évaluation du risque de Khorana) et des niveaux de P-sélectine soluble avec les événements thrombotiques chez les patients atteints d’un cancer lymphoïde.
MÉTHODES: Il s’agit d’une étude transversale comparative menée au Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH, Nnewi, État d’Anambra). Quarante-cinq patients atteints d’un cancer lymphoïde et 45 sujets apparemment sains ont participé à l’étude. Le score modifié d’évaluation du risque de Khorana a été utilisé pour évaluer le risque thrombotique associé au cancer. Un échantillon de sang a été prélevé pour l’estimation de la P-sélectine soluble. Les données ont été analysées avec SPSS version 23.
RÉSULTATS: L’âge des sujets atteints de néoplasme lymphoïde et des témoins était respectivement de 49,1±15,8 ans et 49,6±11,1 ans (p = 0,548). Les sujets atteints de néoplasme lymphoïde sont 26 (57,8 %) hommes et 19 (42,2 %) femmes, tandis que les témoins sont 25 (55,6 %) hommes et 20 (44,4 %) femmes. Le lymphome non hodgkinien était le néoplasme lymphoïde le plus fréquent (18, 40 %), suivi du myélome multiple (10, 22 %), de la LLC (9, 20 %), de la LAL (6, 13 %) et du lymphome hodgkinien (2, 4 %). Trente-cinq (77,8 %) sujets atteints de néoplasmes lymphoïdes présentaient un score de risque intermédiaire et 10 (22,2 %) un score de risque élevé.

Occasionally, FL is associated with tumoral epidural compression and management of these patients remain poorly codified. This study aims to report incidence, clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of patients with FL and tumoral epidural compression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, retrospective cohort study of adult patients with FL and epidural tumor compression, treated in a French Institute over the last 20 years (2000-2021).
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2021, 1382 patients with FL were followed by the haematological department. Of them, 22 (1.6%) patients (16 men and 6 women) had follicular lymphoma with epidural tumor compression. At epidural tumor compression occurrence, 8/22 (36%) patients had a neurological clinical deficit (motor, sensory or sphincter function) and 14/22 (64%) had tumor pain. All patients were treated with immuno-chemotherapy; the main regimen being used was R-CHOP plus high dose IV methotrexate in 16/22 (73%) patients. Radiotherapy for tumor epidural compression was performed in 19/22 (86%) patients. With a median follow-up of 60 months (range=[1-216]), 5 year local tumor relapse free survival was achieved in 65% (95% CI 47-90%) of patients. The median PFS was of 36 months (95% CI 24-NA) and 5 years OS estimate was 79% (95% CI 62-100%). Two patients developed a relapse at a second epidural site.

Historically, patients were treated according to classical HL protocols. Due to high toxicity and excellent prognosis, management of NLPHL shifted to de-escalation protocol with good results. No treatment beyond surgical resection was proposed for localized unique nodal disease completely resected. The closed European protocol (EuroNet PHL LP1) evaluated the efficacy of low intensity chemotherapy protocol based on CVP courses (cyclophosphamide vinblastine prednisone) for stage IA/IIA not fully resected. Final results are not yet available. Advanced stage NLPHL are rare and there is no clinical trial and no consensus treatment in children. The SFCE lymphoma committee recently established recommendations for staging and treatment of limited and advanced NLPHL in children based on current practices and published results. The goal was to allow homogeneous practice on a national scale. If incomplete resection for patients with stage I/IIA combination of low intensity chemotherapy (CVP) and rituximab is recommended. For intermediary and advanced stage intensification with AVD (adriamycine vinblastine dacarbazine) or CHOP courses (cyclophosphamide doxorubicine vincristine prednisone) combined with rituximab are advocated.

The objective of this study was to explore the factors associated with the performance of radiotherapy and to assess its prognostic impact in patients with MALT lymphoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MALT lymphoma diagnosed between 1992 and 2017 were identified in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER). Factors associated with the delivery of radiotherapy were assessed by chi-square test. Overall survival (OS) and lymphoma-specific survival (LSS) were compared between patients with and without radiotherapy, using Cox proportional hazard regression models, in patients with early stage as well as those with advanced stage.
RESULTS: Of the 10,344 patients identified with a diagnosis of MALT lymphoma, 33.6% had received radiotherapy; this rate was 38.9% for stage I/II patients and 12.0% for stage III/IV patients, respectively. Older patients and those who already received primary surgery or chemotherapy had a significantly lower rate of receiving radiotherapy, regardless of lymphoma stage. After univariate and multivariate analysis, radiotherapy was associated with improved OS and LSS in patients with stage I/II (HR=0.71 [0.65-0.78]) and (HR=0.66 [0.59-0.74]), respectively, but not in patients with stage III/IV (HR=1.01 [0.80-1.26]) and (HR=0.93 [0.67-1.29]). The nomogram built from the significant prognostic factors associated with overall survival of stage I/II patients had a good concordance (C-index=0.749±0.002).

Prolonged remissions after several years of follow-up suggest that there is a curative effect of CAR T-cells therapy, whereas allo-HCT was previously considered the only curative treatment in relapse situation. The aim of this harmonization workshop is to detail the existing data in the literature on the feasibility of allo-HCT after CAR T-cells and to propose to consider allograft in selected patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In B-ALL, various intrinsic factors (inherent to the patient, to the disease, to the type of CAR T-cells) and especially various post CAR T-cells criteria (early expansion kinetics, residual disease at D28, early loss of B-cell aplasia) should lead to consider performing allo-HCT before the occurrence of a relapse. In DLBCL, although there are risk factors for relapse at diagnosis and prior to CAR T-cells therapy, response assessed by PET-CT at three months is critical and allo-HCT cannot currently be recommended in cases of complete or partial remission.

,"34955421","Radiation therapy of cutaneous cancers.","Hennequin C","We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on radiotherapy of cutaneous cancers. The indications of radiotherapy for skin cancers are not clearly defined because of the lack of randomized trials or prospective studies. For basal cell carcinomas, radiotherapy frequently offers a good local control, but a randomized trial showed that surgery is more efficient and less toxic. Indications of radiotherapy are contra-indications of surgery for patients older than 60, non-sclerodermiform histology and located in non-sensitive areas. Adjuvant radiotherapy could be proposed to squamous cell carcinomas, in case of poor prognostic factors. Dose of 60 to 70Gy are usually required, and must be modulated to the size of the lesions. Adjuvant radiotherapy seems beneficial for desmoplastic melanomas but not for the other histological types. Prophylactic nodal irradiation (45 to 50Gy), for locally advanced tumors (massive nodal involvement), decreases the locoregional failure rate but do not increase survival. Adjuvant radio- therapy (50 to 56Gy) for Merkel cell carcinomas increases also the local control rate, as demonstrated by meta-analysis and a large epidemiological study. Nodal areas must be included, if there is no surgical exploration (sentinel lymph node dissection). Kaposi sarcomas are radiosensitive and could be treated with relatively low doses (24 to 30Gy). Also, cutaneous lymphomas are good indications for radiotherapy: B lymphomas are electively treated with limited fields.

In this long-term follow-up study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of autologous HSCT versus interferon alfa maintenance after chemotherapy without or with rituximab in patients with primary advanced-stage mantle cell lymphoma.
METHODS: We did a post-hoc, long-term analysis of an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 121 participating hospitals or practices across six European countries. Patients who were aged 18-65 years with previously untreated stage III-IV mantle cell lymphoma and an ECOG performance score of 0-2 were eligible for participation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either myeloablative radiochemotherapy (fractionated total body irradiation with 12 Gy/day 6-4 days before autologous HSCT and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg per day intravenously 3-2 days before autologous HSCT) followed by autologous HSCT (the autologous HSCT group) or interferon alfa maintenance (the interferon alfa maintenance group; 6 × 10
FINDINGS: Between Sept 30, 1996, and July 1, 2004, 269 patients were randomly assigned to receive either autologous HSCT or interferon alfa maintenance therapy. The median follow-up was 14 years (IQR 10-16), with the intention-to-treat population consisting of 174 patients (93 [53%] in the autologous HSCT group and 81 [47%] in the interferon alfa maintenance group) who responded to induction therapy. The median age was 55 years (IQR 47-60), and R-CHOP was used in 68 (39%) of 174 patients. The median progression-free survival was 3·3 years (95% CI 2·5-4·3) in the autologous HSCT group versus 1·5 years (1·2-2·0) in the interferon alfa maintenance group (log-rank p<0·0001; aHR 0·50 [95% CI 0·36-0·69]). The median overall survival was 7·5 years (95% CI 5·7-12·0) in the autologous HSCT group versus 4·8 years (4·0-6·6) in the interferon alfa maintenance group (log-rank p=0·019; aHR 0·66 [95% CI 0·46-0·95]). For patients treated without rituximab, the progression-free survival adjusted HR for autologous HSCT versus interferon alfa was 0·40 (0·26-0·61), in comparison to 0·72 (0·42-1·24) for patients treated with rituximab. For overall survival, the adjusted hazard ratio for HSCT versus interferon alfa was 0·52 (0·33-0·82) without rituximab and 1·05 (0·55-1·99) for patients who received rituximab.
INTERPRETATION: Our results confirm the long-term efficacy of autologous HSCT to treat mantle cell lymphoma established in the pre-rituximab era. The suggested reduced efficacy after immunochemotherapy supports the need for its re-evaluation now that antibody maintenance, high-dose cytarabine, and targeted treatments have changed the standard of care for patients with mantle cell lymphoma.

Then, a comparison between AYAs and adults and between the subgroups of AYAs treated with the same adult protocol was accomplished to further inform on optimal therapy approach of choice for adolescent patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this mono-centric, retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records. We analyzed 112 consecutive North Tunisian patients, including 66 AYAs (15 to 39 years) and 46 adults (≥40years) affected by cHL treated from 2000 to 2015 at Salah Azaiez Institute. Then, we performed a comparative analysis between AYA and 46 adult patients and a subgroup analysis between adolescents and young adults. All patients were treated according to the national protocol for HL, edited by the Tunisian Society of Hematology. The treatment included chemotherapy and involved-field radiotherapy (RT) at a dose of 20 or 30 Grays (Gy) for responders and 36Gy for non-responders.
RESULTS: AYA patients presented with adverse features with nodular sclerosis subtype (p=3.88×10

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the French BIA-ALCL cases diagnosed by the Lymphopath network and reported to the National Medical Safety Agency (ANSM). Wishing to obtain supplementary data on the prosthetic history of implants, we sent the referent surgeons a questionnaire.
RESULTS: By combining the relevant ANSM data and questionnaire data, we studied the histories of 32 unilateral cases of BIA-ALCL and 2 bilateral cases of BIA-ALCL. Mean patient age on diagnosis was 59 (29; 83). Twelve BIA-ALCL cases occurred after breast augmentation for esthetic purposes, 22 following mastectomy for neoplasia and 2 after symmetrization of the contralateral breast in reconstruction. Fifteen BIA-ALCL cases were diagnosed on single prostheses, all of them macrotextured with macrotexturing obtained by projection of biocell salt crystals, also known as the biocell ""salt loss"" technique. The other 21 BIA-ALCL cases were diagnosed on multiple prostheses (2 to 5), and all of them had had at least one contact with a biocell implant. Mean duration of exposure to implants was 11 years (4; 31). Mean duration of exposure to the macrotextured shell surfaces obtained by the salt loss technique was 9 years (2; 23). Six patients were exposed to a temporary macrotextured Expander implant obtained with the aforementioned salt loss technique. No patient was exposed to the macrotextured Expander implant alone.

We assessed late health outcomes after LMB treatment in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multivariable regression models compared chronic health conditions, health status, and socioeconomic and neurocognitive outcomes between survivors of NHL treated with the LMB regimen (n = 126), survivors of NHL treated with non-LMB regimens (n = 444), and siblings (n = 1,029).
RESULTS: LMB survivors were a median age of 10.2 years (range, 2.5 to 20.5 years) at diagnosis and 24.0 years (range, 10.3 to 35.3 years) at evaluation. Compared with siblings, LMB survivors were at increased risk for adverse health outcomes. However, survivors of NHL treated with LMB and non-LMB regimens did not differ with regard to risk of having any chronic health conditions, impaired health status, neurocognitive deficits, or poorer socioeconomic outcomes. Increased risk for the following specific neurologic conditions was observed in LMB survivors compared with non-LMB survivors: epilepsy (relative risk [RR], 15.2; 95% CI, 3.1 to 73.4); balance problems (RR, 8.9; 95% CI, 2.3 to 34.8); tremors (RR, 7.5; 95% CI, 1.9 to 29.9); weakness in legs (RR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.5 to 26.4); severe headaches (RR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.3); and prolonged arm, leg, or back pain (RR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.2 to 7.1). The survivors from the group C LMB risk group (n = 50) were at the highest risk for these conditions; however, except for worse functional status (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.8), they were not at increased risk for other adverse health status or socioeconomic outcomes compared with non-LMB survivors.

Reporting the first case of localized Hodgkin lymphoma treated with protontherapy in France. A 24-year-old female with mediastinal, bulky, localized, mixed-cellularity, classic Hodgkin lymphoma required an involved-site radiation therapy after complete response following polychemotherapy. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy was not acceptable due to high doses to breasts, heart and lungs. We realized a four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) to evaluate target movements and another CT with gating and breath-hold technique. Delineation was performed on both CT using the initial fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/CT. One dosimetric plan with rotational intensity-modulated radiation therapy with a helical Tomotherapy© was realized and compared to another one with conformational protontherapy. Ninety-five percent of the planning target volume was covered by 98 and 99% of the prescribed dose with protontherapy and helical Tomotherapy©. Protontherapy provided the best organ at risk protection. Lung and heart protections were better with protontherapy: lung mean dose (3.7Gy vs. 8.4Gy) and median dose (0.002Gy vs. 6.9Gy), heart mean dose (2.6Gy vs. 3.7Gy). Breast sparing was better for both breasts using protontherapy: right breast mean dose (2.4Gy vs. 4.4Gy) and left (1.9Gy vs. 4.6Gy). The biggest difference was seen with low doses, which were better with protontherapy: volume of lung receiving 5Gy was 17.5% vs. 54.2% with Helical Tomotherapy©. In view of these results, we decided to treat our patient with protontherapy using respiratory assessment.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study consisted in the retrospective analysis of 30 consecutive patients with recurrent/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma who received involved-field radiotherapy after autologous stem cell transplantation. Our policy was of adding involved-field radiotherapy for patients with positive PET scan before autologous stem cell transplantation (23 out of 30 patients, 77%), and/or irradiating sites of bulky disease at relapse (11 out of 30 patients, 37%). Patients were stratified into four risk groups according to the presence of the five clinical risk factors identified by the GHSG; (1) stage IV disease; (2) time to relapse≤3 months; (3) ECOG-PS≥1; (4) bulk≥5cm; and (5) inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The median interval from autologous stem cell transplantation to involved-field radiotherapy was 3 months (range, 1-7 months), and the median involved-field radiotherapy dose was 35Gy (range, 12-40Gy). At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 1-132 months), the 2-year progression-free survival in the entire series was 60%.

We update the data on patterns of low-grade Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection among children in northern Tanzania.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence (pfPR) was assessed in a representative sample of 819 children enrolled in 94 villages in northern Tanzania between October 2015 and August 2016, using a complex survey design. Individual- and household-level risk factors for pfPR were elicited using structured questionnaires. pfPR was assessed using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and thick film microscopy (TFM). Associations with pfPR, based on RDT, were assessed using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI) from weighted survey logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence (pfPR) was 39.5% (95% CI: 31.5, 47.5) by RDT and 33.4% (26.0, 40.6) by TFM. pfPR by RDT was inversely associated with higher-education parents, especially mothers (5-7 years of education: aOR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.96, senior secondary education: aOR 0.10; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.55), living in a house near the main road (aOR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.76), in a larger household (two rooms: aOR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.79, more than two rooms OR 0.35; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.62).

Five-year overall survival is greater than 90% but leukemia remains a major cause of death from cancer in children. A new class of immunotherapy based on a chimeric antigen receptor ""CAR"" targeting the CD19 on the B leukemic cells and that is transduced in an autologous or allogenic T lymphocyte will allow to transform the prognosis of refractory or relapsed B-ALL. Overall response rates range from 60 to 90% in phase I-II studies in patients with second relapse or more or with refractory disease. Persistent remissions and even cures have been observed. These very good results could lead to use this treatment in first line for patients with very high-risk disease. However, CAR-T cells production, costs and adverse events management represent major issues for the future of this therapeutic.

A diagnosis was made of Sézary syndrome (SS), a leukaemic form of epidermotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. After three years of treatment with methotrexate, the patient developed transformed SS with visceral involvement. Given the high risk of relapse and the absence of an HLA-compatible donor, haploidentical bone marrow grafting was performed. The patient was still in complete remission two and a half years later. The disease course was nevertheless marked by the emergence one year after grafting of a Blaschko-distributed lichenoid eruption having histological features consistent with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); treatment with topical betamethasone proved efficacious.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of haploidentical grafting for systemic and transformed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This approach could henceforth represent a therapeutic option for patients requiring an allograft in the absence of compatible donors.

We propose in this study to report the therapeutic results of the national protocol of adult HL treatment (MDH2008).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study is prospective multicenter interesting 444 patients followed for HL between July 2008 and June 2013 and treated according to the MDH2008 protocol. The median age of our patients was 30 years. B symptoms were present in 62.8 % of our patients. According to the Ann Arbor classification, our patients were in stages I, II, III and IV in 3 %, 42 %, 26 % and 29 %, respectively. The MDH2008 protocol is based on a strategy adapted to the therapeutic response to 2 cycles of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Response≥75 % to 2 courses of chemotherapy was achieved in 43 % of patients and the response rate at the end of treatment was 92.1 %. Forty-eight patients (11.4 %) had primary failure. In the multi-variant study, bulky mediastinal mass (IMT≥0.35) was an independent predictive factor of primary failure (P: 0.000). Nineteen toxic deaths (4.35 %) were reported. The relapse rate was 7.8 %. Event free survival, relapse-free survival and overall survival at 5years were 75 %, 89 % and 90 %, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 56-year-old woman developed cutaneous indurated and ulcerated nodular lesions 6 months after starting fingolimod for active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Histological examination of a punch biopsy sample demonstrated a polymorphous dermal infiltrate containing large atypical CD30+ cells, leading to diagnosis of primary cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scans were performed to rule out secondary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Spontaneous clinical regression was observed and after assessing the benefit/risk ratio, it was decided to continue fingolimod under strict surveillance, with no relapse occurring by month 18.
DISCUSSION: A systematic review of PUBMED/Medline and Embase identified seven other cases of lymphoproliferative disorders occurring during fingolimod treatment, including two other cases of primitive cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders.
CONCLUSION: Even if cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders occur only rarely during fingolimod treatment, dermatologists should nevertheless be aware of this association for which strict dermatological surveillance is required.

AIM: To describe skin lesions in ATLL.
METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study between 1996 and 2016, including all patients diagnosed with ATLL at Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, France).
RESULTS: Thirty-seven ATLL patients were included. Fifteen patients (41%) had a cutaneous localization of the disease, which was present from the beginning of the disease for two thirds of them. ATLL types in patients with cutaneous localization of the disease were as follows: lymphoma, n=5, chronic, n=4, smoldering, n=4, acute, n=2. Half the patients had 2 or more cutaneous manifestations. The cutaneous localizations observed were as follows: nodulotumoral (n=8), plaques (n=7), multipapular (n=6), macular (n=4), purpuric (n=2). Among the 15 patients with cutaneous localization, median overall survival was significantly shorter in the acute and lymphoma types compared to the smoldering and chronic types (8.7 months vs. 79 months, P=0.003).
DISCUSSION: ATLL is a hematologic malignancy with variable expression that is diagnosed only very rarely in metropolitan France, but that should be sought in patients from countries with high HTLV-1 prevalence in the event of a chronic eruption with patches, papules, plaques and/or tumors.

In this observational study, we compared real-world efficacy, toxicity, and costs of four frequently employed treatment strategies for Burkitt lymphoma: the Lymphome Malins B (LMB), the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM), the HOVON, and the CODOX-M/IVAC regimens. We collected data from 147 adult patients treated in eight referral centers.

There was no significant difference between age, sex ratio, disease stage, or percentage HIV-positive patients between the treatment groups. Five-year progression-free survival (69%, p = 0.966) and 5-year overall survival (69%, p = 0.981) were comparable for all treatment groups. Treatment-related toxicity was also comparable with only hepatotoxicity seen more frequently in the CODOX/M-IVAC group (p = 0.004). Costs were determined by the number of rituximab gifts and the number of inpatients days. Overall, CODOX-M/IVAC had the most beneficial profile with regards to costs, treatment duration, and percentage of patients completing planned treatment.

Risk-adapted strategies, using positron emission tomography staging, are about to become a standard, both in adult and pediatric protocols. These approaches allow obtaining excellent results in adolescents with Hodgkin lymphoma. On the other hand, treatment of adolescents with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma raises some questions. Even through children have good outcomes when treated with risk-adapted strategies, adolescents who are between 15 and 18 years old seem to experience poorer survivals, whereas patients older than 18 years old have globally the same outcome than older adults. This category of patient needs a particular care, based on a tight coordination between adults and pediatric oncologists. Primary mediastinal lymphomas, a subtype of BLDCL frequent in young adult population, exhibits poorer outcomes in children or young adolescent population than in older ones.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A male patient presented an ulcerated lesion of the ankle that had been present for six years. Biopsy revealed pagetoid migration of CD8+, CD2-, CD5-, CD7+, CD30- and CD56- lymphocytes with expression of cytotoxic markers and of Ki67 in over 60% of cells. The resulting diagnosis was one of pagetoid cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also known as Woringer-Kolopp disease. Despite treatment with methotrexate and carmustine, the ulcer worsened rapidly within two months. Subsequent biopsy revealed epidermal and dermal infiltration with large cells of identical phenotype to that seen in the previous biopsy, with angiocentrism and expression of Ki67 in over 90% of cells, pointing to a diagnosis of AECL. Progression to disseminated ulceronecrotic lesions occurred rapidly, and the patient died of sepsis within a few months.
DISCUSSION: AECL is characterised by ulcerative-haemorrhagic lesions that develop aggressively without any preceding mild cutaneous lesions. Median survival is 12 months. Histological analysis shows pagetoid epidermotropism comprising large monomorphic CD8+, CD2- and CD5- cells with markers for cytotoxicity and high expression of Ki67.

This article reports the case of a 60 years old patient with a progressive swelling of the right breast after aesthetic breast implants. Diagnostic was delayed because first surgeon was not familiar with the disease. Patient was then referred to us for management. We performed an implant removal and a complete capsulectomy. Pathologic report confirms the diagnostic. After one year and normal ultrasound evaluation, we reconstructed the breast with lipomodeling and mastopexy. Contralateral implant was also removed at time of reconstruction. Vast majority of breast implant-associated ALCL occurs at a time lapse of 11 to 15 years after implant augmentation, with a mean age of 63 years.

In case of aesthetic surgery, mastopexia can be done to allow for glandular shaping. Lipomodeling is an excellent technique to correct the lack of volume due to implant removal. In case of reconstructive setting, implant can be replaced by flap procedure with lipomodeling if needed or lipomodeling alone if recipient site is favorable and patient has enough fat tissue. Contralateral implant should be removed during reconstruction time.","2016",,"Ann Chir Plast Esthet",,"other","Adipose Tissue, FALSE, transplantation, Q000637, Breast Implants, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Delayed Diagnosis, FALSE, Device Removal, FALSE, Diagnostic Errors, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Mammaplasty, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Rare Diseases, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"

Findings from single-arm studies suggest that addition of rituximab to these regimens could improve patient outcomes. Our objective was to test this possibility in a randomised trial.
METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients older than 18 years with untreated HIV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma (including Burkitt's leukaemia) from 45 haematological centres in France. Exclusion criteria were contraindications to any drug included in the chemotherapy regimens, any serious comorbidity, poor renal (creatinine concentration >150 μmol/L) or hepatic (cirrhosis or previous hepatitis B or C) function, pregnancy, and any history of cancer except for non-melanoma skin tumours or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma. Patients were stratified into two groups based on disease extension (absence [group B] or presence [group C] of bone marrow or central nervous system involvement). Patients were further stratified in group C according to age (<40 years, 40-60 years, and >60 years) and central nervous system involvement. Participants were randomly assigned in each group to either intravenous rituximab injections and chemotherapy (lymphome malin B [LMB]) or chemotherapy alone by the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte datacentre. Randomisation was stratified by treatment group and centre using computer-assisted permuted-block randomisation (block size of four; allocation ratio 1:1). We gave rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and day 6 during the first two courses of chemotherapy (total of four infusions). The primary endpoint is 3 year event-free survival (EFS). We analysed all patients who had data available according to their originally assigned group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00180882.
RESULTS: Between Oct 14, 2004, and Sept 7, 2010, we randomly allocated 260 patients to rituximab or no rituximab (group B 124 patients [64 no rituximab; 60 rituximab]; group C 136 patients [66 no rituximab; 70 rituximab]). With a median follow-up of 38 months (IQR 24-59), patients in the rituximab group achieved better 3 year EFS (75% [95% CI 66-82]) than did those in the no rituximab group (62% [53-70]; log-rank p stratified by treatment group=0·024). The hazard ratio estimated with a Cox model stratified by treatment group, assuming proportionality, was 0·59 for EFS (95% CI 0·38-0·94; p=0·025). Adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups. The most common adverse events were infectious (grade 3-4 in 137 [17%] treatment cycles in the rituximab group vs 115 [15%] in the no rituximab group) and haematological (mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 3·31 days per cycle [95% CI 3·01-3·61] vs 3·38 days per cycle [3·05-3·70]) events.
INTERPRETATION: Addition of rituximab to a short intensive chemotherapy programme improves EFS in adults with Burkitt's leukaemia or lymphoma.

In this study, we evaluate the potential reduction of dose to normal tissue with helical tomotherapy and proton therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma involved-field or involved-site irradiation compared to standard 3D conformal radiation therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen female patients with supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated at our institution with 3D conformal radiation therapy or helical tomotherapy to a dose of 30Gy in 15 fractions. A planning comparison was achieved including proton therapy with anterior/posterior passive scattered beams weighted 20Gy/10Gy.
RESULTS: Mean doses to breasts, lung tissue and heart with proton therapy were significantly lower compared to helical tomotherapy and to 3D conformal radiation therapy. Helical tomotherapy assured the best protection of lungs from doses above 15Gy with the V20Gy equal to 16.4%, compared to 19.7% for proton therapy (P=0.01) or 22.4% with 3D conformal radiation therapy (P<0.01). Volumes of lung receiving doses below 15Gy were significantly larger for helical tomotherapy than for proton therapy or 3D conformal radiation therapy, with respective lung doses V10Gy=37.2%, 24.6% and 27.4%. Also, in the domain of low doses, the volumes of breast that received more than 10Gy or more than 4Gy with helical tomotherapy were double the corresponding volumes for proton therapy, with V4Gy representing more than a third of one breast volume with helical tomotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy achieved a better protection to the lungs for doses above 15Gy than passive proton therapy or 3D conformal radiation therapy. However, dose distributions could generally be improved by using protons even with our current passive-beam technology, especially allowing less low dose spreading and better breast tissue sparing, which is an important factor to consider when treating Hodgkin's lymphomas in female patients. Prospective clinical study is needed to evaluate the tolerance and confirm these findings.","2016",,"Cancer Radiother"," PURPOSE : Second cancers and cardiovascular toxicities are long term radiation toxicity in locally advanced Hodgkin's lymphomas ","comparative study","Adult, FALSE, Breast, FALSE, radiation effects, Q000528, Female, FALSE, Heart, FALSE, radiation effects, Q000528, Hodgkin Disease, FALSE, radiotherapy, Q000532, Humans, FALSE, Lung, FALSE, radiation effects, Q000528, Mediastinal Neoplasms, FALSE, radiotherapy, Q000532, Organ Sparing Treatments, FALSE, Organs at Risk, TRUE, Proton Therapy, TRUE, Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted, FALSE, Radiotherapy, Conformal, TRUE, Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated, TRUE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of rituximab with bendamustine or fludarabine in patients with relapsed, indolent, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mantle-cell lymphoma.
METHODS: For this randomised, non-inferiority, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 55 centres in Germany, who were subsequently randomised centrally according to prespecified randomisation lists with permuted blocks of randomly variable block size to rituximab (375 mg/m(2), day 1) plus either bendamustine (90 mg/m(2), days 1 and 2) or fludarabine (25 mg/m(2), days 1-3) every 28 days for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Patients were aged 18 years or older with a WHO performance status of 0-2 and had relapsed or refractory indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma; patients refractory to regimens that included rituximab, bendamustine, or purine analogue drugs were excluded. Patients were stratified by histological subtypes of lymphoma and by their latest previous therapies. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and the final analysis was completed per protocol. Non-inferiority of bendamustine plus rituximab versus fludarabine plus rituximab was defined as a difference of less than 15% in 1-year progression-free survival. The protocol was amended in July, 2006, after approval of rituximab maintenance (375 mg/m(2) every 3 months for up to 2 years), which was then given to patients achieving a response to either trial treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01456351 (closed to enrolment, follow-up is ongoing).
FINDINGS: Between Oct 8, 2003, and Aug 5, 2010, we randomly assigned 230 patients to treatment groups (116 bendamustine plus rituximab, 114 fludarabine plus rituximab). 11 patients were excluded for protocol violations and were not followed up further (two in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and nine in the fludarabine plus rituximab group). Thus, 219 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis (114 bendamustine plus rituximab, 105 fludarabine plus rituximab). 1-year progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 0·76 (95% CI 0·68-0·84) and 0·48 (0·39-0·58) with fludarabine plus rituximab (non-inferiority p<0·0001). At a median follow-up of 96 months (IQR 73·2-112·9), median progression-free survival with bendamustine plus rituximab was 34·2 months (95% CI 23·5-52·7) and 11·7 months (8·0-16·1) with fludarabine plus rituximab (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54 [95% CI 0·38-0·72], log-rank test p<0·0001). Safety outcomes were similar in both groups, with 46 serious adverse events recorded (23 in the bendamustine plus rituximab group and 23 in the fludarabine plus rituximab group), most commonly myelosuppression and infections.
INTERPRETATION: In combination with rituximab, bendamustine was more effective than fludarabine, suggesting that bendamustine plus rituximab may be the preferred treatment option for patients with relapsed indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas.

We currently prefer to differentiate so-called ""specific"" inflammations, for which an etiology is able to be identified, from idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndromes (IOIS), for which the etiology remains unknown and the histology is nonspecific.
PURPOSE: To propose an efficient diagnostic approach for clinicians managing patients with non-Graves' orbital inflammations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective and prospective study concerning 61 patients managed by the medical team for non-Graves' orbital inflammations between May, 1999 and May, 2013 in the ophthalmology departments of Nice and Limoges university hospitals in France. Seventeen specific inflammations, 19 orbital lymphomas and 25 idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndromes were included. Patients were divided into two groups. Thirty-six patients (group 1) underwent primary biopsy, while for the other 25 (group 2), therapy was begun empirically without biopsy. We could therefore compare both approaches in terms of diagnostic efficiency and time until identification of a specific etiology.
RESULTS: Our statistical results show that an approach without primary biopsy leads to a number of specific diagnoses statistically much lower than that obtained by the approach with primary biopsy. Also, the risk of missing a specific inflammation (with as a consequence an inappropriate treatment and a risk of functional sequelae as well as a fatal risk of missing a lymphoproliferative pathology) is very clearly higher in the case of not performing primary biopsy. Finally, the average time elapsed between the initial consultation with the ophthalmologist and a specific diagnosis was one month in the case of the first approach, while this delay was almost three times higher with the second approach, with a mean of 2.91 months (P<0.01).
DISCUSSION: Our study shows that biopsy should be the mainstay of diagnostic management. A trial of empiric treatment is only performed first in myositis or in locations where biopsy could jeopardize functional prognosis. It should only be done after biopsy in all other cases. Of course, in all cases of relapse or recurrence after treatment, biopsy should be performed or repeated.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic work-up of a patient with an orbital inflammatory process must of course include blood testing and orbital imaging, but also a systematic primary biopsy for histological examination in the vast majority of cases. It must be repeated at least in the case of any doubt about the diagnosis or in the case of any recurrence or resistance to treatment.","2015",,"J Fr Ophtalmol"," PURPOSE : To propose an efficient diagnostic approach for clinicians managing patients with non-Graves ' orbital inflammations ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adrenal Cortex Hormones, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Autoimmune Diseases, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biopsy, TRUE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Contraindications, FALSE, Dacryocystitis, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Decision Trees, TRUE, Diagnostic Errors, FALSE, prevention & control, Q000517, Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Inflammation, FALSE, Lymphoma, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Orbital Diseases, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Orbital Myositis, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Orbital Neoplasms, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"

BACKGROUND: In addition to recurrent infectious complications, mainly due to encapsulated bacteria, CVID may be complicated by diffuse infiltrative, non-infectious lung disease. The latter may be related to granulomatosis, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, follicular bronchiolitis, follicular nodular hyperplasia, organizing pneumonia or lymphoma. Different lymphoid histological lesions can co-exist and form a new entity called GLILD (granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease), which is associated with a poor prognosis. Replacement of immunoglobulins significantly decreases the frequency and severity of infections but has no impact on the non-infectious complications.
OUTLOOK: Studies are needed to determine the modalities of follow-up and better understand the long-term progress of GLILD. These studies should improve the management of GLILD in the context of immunosuppressive treatments, which increase the risk of infection in CVID.

By way of a seven-year experience of a tertiary center, we discuss the presentation and we review the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.
OBSERVATIONS: We report six cases of PIOL associated with PCNSL. For all patients, the clinical presentation was a vitreoretinal syndrome. The diagnosis was histologically confirmed by vitreal sample or brain biopsy. Five patients developed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Only one patient developed a T-cell lymphoma. The treatment consisted of conformational radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy and intravitreal injections of methotrexate. The median survival after the diagnosis was 24 months.
DISCUSSION: PIOL, associated with PCNSL, is the most common type of ocular lymphoma. In most cases, ocular manifestations inaugurate the disease. PIOL is often fatal because of ultimate central nervous system presentation. The role of the ophthalmologist consists in early diagnosis. Typical clinical findings include vitroretinal tumor syndrome but can mascarade other eye pathologies. Diagnosis requires histology. The majority of PIOL is diffused large B-cell lymphoma. Decisions are made through multidisciplinary consultation. PIOL exhibits high responsiveness to methotrexate.

We evaluated the timing and type of events in newly diagnosed DLBCL and compared patient outcome with reference population data.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy were prospectively enrolled onto the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group NCCTG-N0489 clinical trial from 2002 to 2009. Patient outcomes were evaluated at diagnosis and in the subsets of patients achieving event-free status at 12 months (EFS12) and 24 months (EFS24) from diagnosis. Overall survival was compared with age- and sex-matched population data. Results were replicated in an external validation cohort from the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA) Lymphome Non Hodgkinien 2003 (LNH2003) program and a registry based in Lyon, France.
RESULTS: In all, 767 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who had a median age of 63 years were enrolled onto the MER and NCCTG studies. At a median follow-up of 60 months (range, 8 to 116 months), 299 patients had an event and 210 patients had died. Patients achieving EFS24 had an overall survival equivalent to that of the age- and sex-matched general population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 1.18; P = .25). This result was confirmed in 820 patients from the GELA study and registry in Lyon (SMR, 1.09; P = .71).

Two patients relapsed; first relapse (4 months from diagnosis) was MD-positive at EOI, the second (36 months from diagnosis) was MD-positive at EOT. At EOI, recurrent rates were similar between the MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients (P = 0·40). At EOT, only 13/32 patients had MRD data available with one relapse in the MRD-positive group and no recurrences in the MRD-negative group (P = 0·077). The study demonstrated molecular-disseminated disease in which IgIGHV primer pools could be used to assess MD. This feasibility study supports future investigations to assess the validity and significance of MD screening in a larger cohort of patients with intermediate-risk mature B-NHL.","2011",,"Br J Haematol",,"clinical trial","Adolescent, FALSE, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Child, FALSE, Epidemiologic Methods, FALSE, Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain, FALSE, Genes, Neoplasm, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lymphoma, B-Cell, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Neoplasm Staging, FALSE, Neoplasm, Residual, FALSE, Recurrence, FALSE, Rituximab, FALSE, Young Adult, FALSE"," MD."," MD.",1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"
,"21395545","Kinase regulation by sulfur and selenium containing compounds.","Sanmartín C","Kinases are enzymes that are involved in a wide-range of cellular targets such as cell proliferation, metabolism, survival and apoptosis. Aberrations in the activity of the kinases have been linked to many human diseases such as diabetes, inflammation and cancer. The discovery of more than 518 kinases encoded by the human genome has spurred the development of rapid screening techniques for potential drugs against these enzymes and these have been identified as interesting targets for medicinal chemistry programs, especially in cancer therapy. On the other hand, sulfur and selenium have been increasingly recognized as essential elements in biology and medicine. Converging data from epidemiological and clinical studies have highlighted these elements as effective chemopreventive agents, particularly against various types of cancer (prostate, lung, breast, leukemia, colon, skin, lymphome, thyroid, pancreas, liver). These elements act through a wide range of potential mechanisms where one identified signal pathway event is kinase modulation, which is common for the two elements and emerges as a valid target. The kinases modulated by sulfur and selenium derivatives include MAP, ERK, JNK, Akt, Cdc2, Cyclin B1 and Cdc25c amongst others. Although both of the elements in question are in the same group in the periodic table and have similar biochemistries, there are relevant differences related to redox potentials, stabilities, oxidation states and anticancer activity. Literature data suggest that the replacement of sulfur by selenium in established cancer chemopreventive agents results in more effective chemopreventive analogs. In view of the multi-target kinase mechanisms in preventing cellular transformation, as well as the differences and similarities between them, in this review we focus on the development of new structures that contain selenium and/or sulfur and discuss our understanding of the regulation of antitumoral effects with emphasis on kinase modulation activity and its implications in cancer.","2011",,"Curr Cancer Drug Targets",," review","Animals, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Phosphotransferases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Selenium Compounds, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Sulfur Compounds, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737",,,1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"

Patte, pour le « Comité Lymphome » de la SFCE Over the past two decades, dramatic improvements in the treatment of children with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma have led to cure rates close to 90%, even in advanced-stage disease. The most frequent localization is abdominal, where Burkitt or Burkitt-like subtypes are predominant. Initial management often occurs in the setting of a urgent surgical intervention where multiple complications may gravely threaten prognosis within days or even hours. The SFCE Lymphoma Committee's guidelines for optimal management include: 1) The diagnosis of lymphoma should be systematically evoked whenever the clinical context is not consistent with idiopathic intussusception, particularly in children over the age of 3 or when clinical and/or ultrasound findings are not typical; 2) Limited bowel resection should be performed only if it allows complete tumor removal and is technically simple without extensive dissection or risk of major complications; 3) If surgical resection is likely to be difficult, risky, or incomplete, surgery should be limited to sampling of peritoneal fluid and tumor; 4) In all cases, adequate tissue should be obtained and sent to the pathology department in appropriate media Analysis of tumor material may require, in addition to histology and cytology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular biology studies in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and prognosis and to guide treatment choices.","2008",,"J Chir (Paris)",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"

To reduce late sequelae, the duration and intensity of chemotherapy has been progressively reduced. The Lymphome Malins de Burkitt (LMB) 89 study reported long-term survival in almost all children with localized resected disease treated with two courses of COPAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone and doxorubicin). This study was designed to confirm the effectiveness of this approach in a larger number of patients in a multinational co-operative study. The patient cohort was part of an international study (French-American-British LMB 96), which included all disease stages and involved three national groups. Patients in this part of the study had resected stage I or completely resected abdominal stage II disease. Following surgery, two courses of COPAD were given, without intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy. One hundred and thirty-two children were evaluable. Two of 264 (0.9%) courses were associated with grade IV toxicity (one stomatitis and one infection). With a median follow up of 50.5 months, the 4 year event-free survival is 98.3% and overall survival is 99.2%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: LNH98-5 was a randomized study that included 399 previously untreated patients, age 60 to 80 years, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients received eight cycles of classical CHOP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2), and prednisone 40 mg/m(2) for 5 days) every 3 weeks. In R-CHOP, rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was administered the same day as CHOP. Survivals were analyzed using the intent-to-treat principle.
RESULTS: Median follow-up is 5 years at present. Event-free survival, progression-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival remain statistically significant in favor of the combination of R-CHOP (P = .00002, P < .00001, P < .00031, and P < .0073, respectively, in the log-rank test). Patients with low-risk or high-risk lymphoma according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index have longer survivals if treated with the combination. No long-term toxicity appeared to be associated with the R-CHOP combination.
CONCLUSION: Using the combination of R-CHOP leads to significant improvement of the outcome of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with significant survival benefit maintained during a 5-year follow-up. This combination should become the standard for treating these patients.","2005",,"J Clin Oncol"," PURPOSE : To analyze the long-term outcome of patients included in the Lymphome Non Hodgkinien study 98-5 ( LNH98-5 ) comparing cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ( CHOP ) to rituximab plus CHOP ( R-CHOP ) in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ","clinical trial","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Antibodies, Monoclonal, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived, FALSE, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Cyclophosphamide, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Disease Progression, FALSE, Doxorubicin, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prednisone, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Rituximab, FALSE, Salvage Therapy, FALSE, Survival Analysis, FALSE, Treatment Outcome, FALSE, Vincristine, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627"," R-CHOP"," survival",1,"projTutoLymphome","2024-02-06"
