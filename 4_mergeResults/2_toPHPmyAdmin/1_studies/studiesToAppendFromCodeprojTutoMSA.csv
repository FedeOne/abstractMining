While a significant proportion of patients experience a relapsing disease, there is currently no biomarker predictive of disease course. We aim to determine whether MOG-IgG epitopes can predict a relapsing course in MOGAD patients.
METHODS: MOG-IgG-seropositive confirmed adult MOGAD patients were included (n=202). Serum MOG-IgG and epitope binding were determined by validated flow cytometry live cell-based assays. Associations between epitopes, disease course, clinical phenotype, Expanded Disability Status Scale and Visual Functional System Score at onset and last review were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 202 MOGAD patients, 150 (74%) patients had MOG-IgG that recognised the immunodominant proline42 (P42) epitope and 115 (57%) recognised histidine103/serine104 (H103/S104). Fifty-two (26%) patients had non-P42 MOG-IgG and showed an increased risk of a relapsing course (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.60, p=0.009). Relapse-freedom was shorter in patients with non-P42 MOG-IgG (p=0.0079). Non-P42 MOG-IgG epitope status remained unchanged from onset throughout the disease course and was a strong predictor of a relapsing course in patients with unilateral optic neuritis (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.98, p=0.038), with high specificity (95%, 95% CI 77% to 100%) and positive predictive value (85%, 95% CI 45% to 98%).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-P42 MOG-IgG predicts a relapsing course in a significant subgroup of MOGAD patients. Patients with unilateral optic neuritis, the most frequent MOGAD phenotype, can reliably be tested at onset, regardless of age and sex. Early detection and specialised management in these patients could minimise disability and improve long-term outcomes.","2024",,"J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry"," We aim to determine whether MOG-IgG epitopes can predict a relapsing course in MOGAD patients ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

We aimed to determine the incidence of DVT among neurodegenerative disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Parkinson's disease [PD], multiple system atrophy [MSA], and progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP]-corticobasal syndrome [CBS]) and the risk factors for the development of DVT.
METHODS: Overall, 229 hospitalized patients with neurodegenerative diseases (65 patients with ALS, 61 with PD, 53 with MSA, and 50 with PSP-CBS) were included in this study. D-dimer value and ultrasonography of the leg vein were assessed to determine the presence or absence of leg DVT. We compared the DVT incidence among each disease group. To identify the risk factors for DVT, a multivariate analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Of 229 patients, 34 had leg DVT; the incidence was significantly higher in patients with PD (38%) than in those with ALS (2%), MSA (5%), or PSP-CBS (4%). Patients with DVT were older, had a smaller waist circumference, had a longer disease duration, and had a high blood pressure (BP) variability. Multivariate analysis revealed that a PD diagnosis and female sex, with a high BP variability were predictive of leg DVT.

,"38216420","Unveiling autonomic failure in synucleinopathies: Significance in diagnosis and treatment.","Clement G","Autonomic failure is frequently encountered in synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body disease, and pure autonomic failure (PAF). Cardiovascular autonomic failure affects quality of life and can be life threatening due to the risk of falls and the increased incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. In PD and PAF, pathogenic involvement is mainly post-ganglionic, while in MSA, the involvement is mainly pre-ganglionic. Cardiovascular tests exploring the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are based on the analysis of continuous, non-invasive recordings of heart rate and digital blood pressure (BP). They assess facets of sympathetic and parasympathetic activities and provide indications on the integrity of the baroreflex arc. The tilt test is widely used in clinical practice. It can be combined with catecholamine level measurement and analysis of baroreflex activity and cardiac variability for a detailed analysis of cardiovascular damage. MIBG myocardial scintigraphy is the most sensitive test for early detection of autonomic dysfunction. It provides a useful measure of post-ganglionic sympathetic fiber integrity and function and is therefore an effective tool for distinguishing PD from other parkinsonian syndromes such as MSA. Autonomic cardiovascular investigations differentiate between certain parkinsonian syndromes that would otherwise be difficult to segregate, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Exploring autonomic failure by gathering information about residual sympathetic tone, low plasma norepinephrine levels, and supine hypertension can guide therapeutic management of orthostatic hypotension (OH).","2024",,"Rev Neurol (Paris)",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"
,"38202163","Management and Treatment for Dysphagia in Neurodegenerative Disorders.","Ueha R","Patients with neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) often experience functional dysphagia, which may involve dysfunction in a specific phase of swallowing or in the entire process. This review outlines the approach to dysphagia in the setting of NDDs. Distinguishing the etiology of dysphagia can be difficult, and it is important to always look out for signs pointing to NDD as the cause. Thorough diagnostic work-up is essential, and it includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, alongside swallowing function tests, such as fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, videofluoroscopic swallowing study, and high-resolution manometry. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach with a treatment plan tailored to each patient. This involves dietary guidance, swallowing rehabilitation, and surgery in cases in which improvement with rehabilitation is inadequate. Surgery may involve altering certain pharyngolaryngeal structures to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of aspiration (swallowing improvement surgery) or separating the airway and digestive tract while sacrificing laryngeal function, with the main goal of preventing aspiration (aspiration prevention surgery). Proper management stems from recognizing the impact of these disorders on swallowing and consistently finding ways to improve the quality of life of patients.","2023",,"J Clin Med",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The purpose of this study is evaluating the risk factors of the myopic maculopathy progression according ATN classification system.
METHODS: Clinic data of 69 high myopia patients aged older than 40 years with a follow-up time of more than 2 years, who underwent fundus photography and OCT examination were retrospectively collected. Fundus changes were evaluated with ATN classification at the first and the last-follow time. And the related factors affecting the progress including axial length (AL), spherical equivalence (SE), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), disc-foveal distance (DFD), optic disc tilt and parapapillary atrophy (PPA) were analyzed.
RESULTS: This study included 69 high myopia patients with mean age 54.29 ± 10.41 years. The progression rate of myopic maculopathy (MM) was approximately 25.56%. Elongated DFD (5.37±0.11mm vs 4.86±0.37mm; p<0.001) and thinner SFCT (138.52±29.38μm vs 184.87±48.72μm; p=0.008) at baseline were linked with MM progression. In multiple logistic regression analysis, DFD was a substantial hazard risk factor (adjusted OR=1.672, 95%CI: 1.135-2.498, p<0.05) after adjusting for age, AL and SFCT were adjusted for. Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that DFD might serve as a predictor to discriminate the MM progression with a cut-off value of 5.15mm and a substantial receiver operating characteristic curve area (AUC: 0.794). Compared with the non-progression group, the progression group had older age (p <0.001), longer AL (p = 0.001), higher optic disc tilt rate (p < 0.001) and higher proportion of pre-existing PPA (p=0.038) at baseline, the differences were statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Based on the ATN classification system, we found that the progression of MM was related to older age, longer AL, high disc tilt, pre-existing PPA, thinner SFCT and longer DFD.

,"38026693","The complex relationship between obesity and neurodegenerative diseases: an updated review.","Neto A","Obesity is a global epidemic, affecting roughly 30% of the world's population and predicted to rise. This disease results from genetic, behavioral, societal, and environmental factors, leading to excessive fat accumulation, due to insufficient energy expenditure. The adipose tissue, once seen as a simple storage depot, is now recognized as a complex organ with various functions, including hormone regulation and modulation of metabolism, inflammation, and homeostasis. Obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammatory state and has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's (PD). Mechanistically, reduced adipose expandability leads to hypertrophic adipocytes, triggering inflammation, insulin and leptin resistance, blood-brain barrier disruption, altered brain metabolism, neuronal inflammation, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. Obesity impacts neurodegenerative disorders through shared underlying mechanisms, underscoring its potential as a modifiable risk factor for these diseases. Nevertheless, further research is needed to fully grasp the intricate connections between obesity and neurodegeneration.

METHOD: We quantified the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre (pRFNL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform (GCIPL) layers thicknesses of 207 PwMS and performed neuropsychological evaluations. The cohort was divided based on disease duration (≤5 years or >5 years). We studied associations between changes in OCT and cognition over time, and assessed the risk of cognitive decline of a pRFNL≤88 µm or GCIPL≤77 µm and its predictive value.
RESULTS: Changes in pRFNL and GCIPL thickness over 3.2 years were associated with evolution of cognitive scores, in the entire cohort and in patients with more than 5 years of disease (p<0.01). Changes in cognition were related to less use of disease-modifying drugs, but not OCT metrics in PwMS within 5 years of onset. A pRFNL≤88 µm was associated with earlier cognitive disability (3.7 vs 9.9 years) and higher risk of cognitive deterioration (HR=1.64, p=0.022).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with PD whose disease was preceded by RBD were surveyed. Data on the course of RBD and PD was collected. Questions were asked about early information about the high risk of phenoconversion to patients with RBD and factors determining the opinion of the surveyed persons.
RESULTS: The majority ( > 60%) of respondents gave a positive answer when asked whether patients should be informed about their high risk of developing PD once diagnosed with RBD. Only a few (7.7%) respondents believed that disclosing such information to the patient should be possible only after obtaining his or her consent. Respondents associated consent to information about the high risk of developing PD in people with RBD with high expectations of the healthcare system. We were unable to determine whether factors such as the gender of the subject, the clinical course of the PD, and the RBD duration had an impact on patients' opinions regarding disclosing knowledge about phenoconversion.

This study aimed to identify an effective approach to improve coughing and to explore the establishment of criteria for the use of gastrostomy based on cough and respiratory dysfunctions.
METHODS: Eighteen probable MSA patients participated in the study. They were categorized into air stacking and non-air stacking groups. First, we investigated how the inspiration volume changes by applying maximum insufflation capacity (MIC). Second, peak cough flow (PCF) was measured by different cough augmentation methods: 1) spontaneous coughing (SpC); 2) SpC with MIC (SpC + MIC); 3) SpC with manually assisted cough (MAC) (SpC + MAC); and 4) SpC with MIC and MAC (SpC + MIC + MAC). Among these four conditions, PCF values were compared to determine the most effective approach for cough augmentation. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed on percent forced vital capacity (%FVC) to determine an index for discriminating PCF below160 L/min, which indicates a high risk of suffocation, involving SpC and SpC + MIC.
RESULTS: Inspiration volume increased significantly with MIC in both groups (P < 0.05), and PCF increased significantly with MIC in the air stacking group (P < 0.01). PCF could not be maintained at 160 L/min when %FVC fell below 59%, even when MIC was applied.
CONCLUSIONS: PCF increases with MIC in patients with MSA.

Our previous study found that this subtype is characterized by less severe autonomic impairment compared to orthostatic hypotension with normal or low norepinephrine levels. However, long-term outcomes have not been determined. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the all-cause mortality and phenoconversion over 7 years.
METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 92 patients with orthostatic hypotension were recruited from the Vanderbilt Autonomic Dysfunction Center. 34 patients with upright norepinephrine levels above 600 pg/mL were included in the hyperadrenergic cohort and 58 composed the orthostatic hypotension cohort. Both cohorts were followed for 7 years while assessing all-cause mortality and phenoconversion to neurodegenerative autonomic disorders.
RESULTS: Hyperadrenergic patients showed an exaggerated orthostatic increase in norepinephrine to 938 ± 305 pg/mL upon head up tilt despite presenting with impaired autonomic reflexes. The 7-year mortality rate was 35% in the hyperadrenergic cohort compared to 22% in orthostatic hypotension (p = 0.01). The hyperadrenergic cohort had a greater phenoconversion rate to multiple system atrophy (p = 0.04), whereas the orthostatic hypotension cohort had greater phenoconversion to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Its classic motor symptoms may be preceded by non-motor symptoms (NMS). Population studies have identified GBA variants as risk factors for idiopathic PD. The increased risk of PD has also been suggested in other Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the evolution of the prevalence of NMS compatible with PD in a cohort of South Brazilian adult patients with Gaucher Disease (GD) type 1, already evaluated 3 years ago (2018). Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) was collected to assess the levels of LSD enzymes (beta-hexosaminidases, beta-glucuronidase) and biomarker of macrophage activation (chitotriosidase, ChT), compared to controls (metachromatic leukodystrophy, MLD). Cognition was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire, daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), depression by Beck´s Inventory, constipation by the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) scale, and REM sleep behavior disorder by the single-question screen. Hyposmia was assessed with Sniffin' Sticks (SST).
RESULTS: Nineteen patients completed the follow-up (mean age of the sample was 44 years; range, 26-71). The patient with the highest number of NMS at the baseline (4 including the lowest SST score) was diagnosed with PD four years later. Apart from an improvement in the ESS score, no other statistical significance was found between the number of NMS between the first and second evaluation, nor between patients with one L444P variant (n = 5) and the rest of the cohort. CSF was collected in five patients (mean age of the sample was 40 years, range 30-53. A significant difference was found in the mean CSF activity levels of beta-hexosaminidases and beta-glucuronidase between GD1 and MLD patients. Mean ChT (CSF) was 62 nmol/h/mL in GD patients and 142 in MLD (n = 6) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient with the highest number of NMS in our 2018 cohort was the one that developed PD, corroborating with the importance of this longitudinal follow-up. CSF and plasma analysis might allow a better understanding of the neurodegenerative processes connecting PD and the lysosomal environment.

METHODS: MSA patients referred to the Movement Disorders Unit in Innsbruck, Austria, between 1999 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalty for variable selection were performed to identify prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed to estimate the 7 years overall survival probability.

RESULTS: A total of 210 MSA patients were included in this analysis, of which 124 patients died. The median survival was 7 years. The following clinical variables were found to significantly affect overall survival and were included in the nomogram: age at symptom onset, falls within 3 years of onset, early autonomic failure including orthostatic hypotension and urogenital failure, and lacking levodopa response. The time-dependent area under curve for internal and external validation was >0.7 within the first 7 years of the disease course.

Immune dysfunction found to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this disease in the literature, while the characteristics of peripheral immune function remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and alterations of peripheral immune function in patients with MSA.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted between January 2021 to December 2022 at SanBo Brain Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. A total of 74 participants were recruited, including 47 MSA patients and 27 non-MSA participants. Peripheral blood samples were collected from each participant. A total of 29 types of immune cells were measured using the flow cytometry analysis technology. Single-factor analysis and multiple-factor analysis (multiple linear regression models) were performed to determine the differences and risk factors in immune cells between the MSA and non-MSA groups.
RESULTS: Alterations of the count or percentage of CD19+ B lymphocytes and CD3-CD56+ B lymphocytes in MSA patients were found in this study. The reductions of the count and percentage of CD19+ B lymphocytes were still robust after adjusting for variables of age, gender, body mass index, albumin, and hemoglobin. Furthermore, the reductions in the count and percentage of CD19+ B lymphocytes in the MSA patients were more significant in women and individuals aged 60 years old or above than in the non-MSA participants.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that MSA patients may be influenced by B lymphocytes, particularly CD19+ cells.

She was diagnosed with MSA Parkinsonian-type (MSA-P) and suddenly died at night at 58 years of age. Reduced striatal DAT-SPECT, putaminal hyperintensity on T2-MRI, and hypometabolism with FDG-PET were present. Genetic testing documented a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. A skin biopsy was obtained and used to perform alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC, which was negative, and immunohistochemical analysis, which demonstrated abnormal alpha-synuclein deposits in cutaneous nerves. Elevated blood neurofilament light chain levels were also documented.
CONCLUSIONS: LRRK2 mutations are the most common cause of monogenic Parkinson's disease (PD) and G2019S is the most frequent variant.

These synucleinopathies are characterized by the deposit of aggregated α-syn in intracellular inclusions observable in neurons and glial cells. In PD and DLB, these aggregates, predominantly located in neurons, are called Lewy Bodies (LBs). These LBs are one of the pathological hallmarks of PD and DLB, alongside dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of PD patient-derived LB fractions to induce nigrostriatal neurodegeneration and α-syn pathology when injected into the striatum or the enteric nervous system of non-human primates. Here, we report the pathological consequences of injecting these LB fractions into the cortex of non-human primates. To this end, we inoculated mesencephalic PD patient-derived LB fractions into the prefrontal cortex of baboon monkeys terminated one year later. Extensive analyses were performed to evaluate pathological markers known to be affected in LB pathologies. We first assessed the hypothesized presence of phosphorylated α-syn at S129 (pSyn) in the prefrontal cortices. Second, we quantified the neuronal, microglial, and astrocytic cell survival in the same cortices. Third, we characterized these cortical LB injections' putative impact on the integrity of the nigrostriatal system. Overall, we observed pSyn accumulation around the injection site in the dorsal prefrontal cortex, in connected cortical regions, and further towards the striatum, suggesting α-syn pathological propagation. The pathology was also accompanied by neuronal loss in these prefrontal cortical regions and the caudate nucleus, without, however, loss of nigral dopamine neurons.

The blunted pulse response to nocturnal respiratory events suggests an abnormal cardiac response to a sleep-related breathing disorder. Patients with MSA have a lower pulse event index (PEI), despite a greater hypoxic burden and a similar frequency of respiratory events. However, the evidence is speculative and not directly proven, and many limitations require further study.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 26 patients with MSA who had undergone overnight oximetry between April 2016 and December 2022.
RESULTS: The median 4% oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (ODI) was 11.6/h, the 6-bpm PEI was 8.9/h, and the PEI/ODI ratio was as low as 0.91. There were three patients with suspected sudden death; all had low PEI/ODI ratios. The PEI/ODI ratio was followed over time in seven patients, all of whom had a decrease in the ratio. However, the PEI was higher than the ODI in 12/26 (46%) of the patients.
CONCLUSION: A low PEI/ODI ratio, reflecting a blunted pulse response to nocturnal respiratory events in patients with MSA, may indicate a worse prognosis.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a risk factor for dementia, has been reported in up to 44% of MSA patients, with predominant impairment of executive functions/attention, visuospatial and verbal deficits, and a variety of non-cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Despite changing concept of CI in this synucleinopathy, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain controversial. Recent neuroimaging studies revealed volume reduction in the left temporal gyrus, and in the dopaminergic nucleus accumbens, while other morphometric studies did not find any gray matter atrophy, in particular in the frontal cortex. Functional analyses detected decreased functional connectivity in the left parietal lobe, bilateral cuneus, left precuneus, limbic structures, and cerebello-cerebral circuit, suggesting that structural and functional changes in the subcortical limbic structures and disrupted cerebello-cerebral networks may be associated with early cognitive decline in MSA. Whereas moderate to severe CI in MSA in addition to prefrontal-striatal degeneration is frequently associated with cortical Alzheimer and Lewy co-pathologies, neuropathological studies of the MCI stage of MSA are unfortunately not available.

This study assessed cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration and blood-brain barrier (BBB) alteration in patients with iRBD compared to controls and ascertain whether these biomarkers may predict phenoconversion to alpha-synucleinopathies (Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)).
METHODS: Patients and controls underwent between 2012 and 2016 a neurological assessment, a lumbar puncture for CSF biomarker analysis (β-amyloid42 - Aβ42; total-tau, and phosphorylated tau), and BBB alteration (CSF/serum albumin ratio). All patients with iRBD were followed until 2021 and then classified into patients who converted to alpha-synucleinopathies (iRBD converters, cRBD) or not (iRBD non-converters, ncRBD).
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with iRBD (mean age 67.12 ± 8.14) and 33 controls (mean age 64.97 ± 8.91) were included. At follow-up (7.63 ± 3.40 years), eight patients were ncRBD and 33 patients were cRBD: eleven converted to PD, 10 to DLB, and two to MSA. Patients with iRBD showed lower CSF Aβ42 levels and higher CSF/serum albumin ratio than controls. Cox regression analysis showed that the phenoconversion rate increases with higher motor impairment (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23, p = 0.032). CSF Aβ42 levels predicted phenoconversion to DLB (HR = 0.67, p = 0.038) and BBB alteration predicted phenoconversion to PD (HR = 1.20, p = 0.038).
DISCUSSION: This study showed that low CSF Aβ42 levels and high BBB alteration may predict the phenoconversion to DLB and PD in patients with iRBD, respectively. These findings highlight the possibility to discriminate phenoconversion in iRBD patients through CSF biomarkers; however, further studies are needed.","2024",,"Sleep","STUDY OBJECTIVES : Patients with isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder ( iRBD ) have an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases ","other","Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Synucleinopathies, TRUE, Eye Movements, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, Biomarkers, FALSE, Serum Albumin, FALSE, Sleep, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) holds promise for regenerative medicine. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of systemic administration of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) in mitigating the loss of muscle mass and strength in mouse model of DEX-induced muscle atrophy.
METHODS: 3-month-old female C57BL/6 mice were treated with Dex (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 10 days to induce muscle atrophy, then subjected to intravenous injection of a single dose of ADSCs ([Formula: see text] cells/kg body weight) or vehicle control. The mice were killed 7 days after ADSCs treatment. Body compositions were measured by animal DXA, gastrocnemius muscle was isolated for ex vivo muscle functional test, histological assessment and Western blot, while tibialis anterior muscles were isolated for RNA-sequencing and qPCR. For in vitro study, C2C12 myoblast cells were cultured under myogenic differentiation medium for 5 days following 100 [Formula: see text]M Dex treatment with or without ADSC-conditioned medium for another 4 days. Samples were collected for qPCR analysis and Western blot analysis. Myotube morphology was measured by myosin heavy chain immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: ADSC treatment significantly increased body lean mass (10-20%), muscle wet weight (15-30%) and cross-sectional area (CSA) (~ 33%) in DEX-induced muscle atrophy mice model and down-regulated muscle atrophy-associated genes expression (45-65%). Hindlimb grip strength (~ 37%) and forelimb ex vivo muscle contraction property were significantly improved (~ 57%) in the treatment group. Significant increase in type I fibres (~ 77%) was found after ADSC injection. RNA-sequencing results suggested that ERK1/2 signalling pathway might be playing important role underlying the beneficial effect of ADSC treatment, which was confirmed by ERK1/2 inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: ADSCs restore the pathogenesis of Dex-induced muscle atrophy with an increased number of type I fibres, stronger muscle strength, faster recovery rate and more anti-fatigue ability via ERK1/2 signalling pathway. The inhibition of muscle atrophy-associated genes by ADSCs offered this treatment as an intervention option for muscle-associated diseases.

METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed, CENTRAL, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for prospective studies on spaceflight and cardiovascular outcomes. Search terms combined cardiovascular disease topics with spaceflight concepts. No date or language restrictions were imposed.
RESULTS: 35 studies representing 2696 space travelers met inclusion criteria. Studies were grouped into spaceflight associations with: atherosclerosis, mortality, cardiac function, orthostatic intolerance, and arrhythmias. Atherosclerosis evidence was limited, with animal studies linking space radiation to endothelial damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation. However, human data showed no significantly increased atherosclerotic disease in astronauts. Mortality studies demonstrated lower cardiovascular mortality in astronauts compared to the general population however there was conflicting data. Cardiac function studies revealed physiologic ventricular atrophy, increased arterial stiffness, and altered blood flow distribution attributed to microgravity exposure. Effects appeared transient and reversible post-flight. Orthostatic intolerance studies found astronauts experienced altered heart rate variability, baroreflex response, and blood pressure changes post-flight. Arrhythmia studies showed increased ventricular ectopy during spaceflight, but limited data on long term flights.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective longitudinal study was to explore the main predictors of survival of MSA patients with new clinical subtypes based on cluster analysis.
METHODS: A total of 153 Chinese MSA patients were recruited in our study. The basic demographic data and motor and nonmotor symptoms were assessed. Cluster and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to eliminate collinearity and search for new clinical subtypes. The multivariable Cox regression was used to find factors associated with survival in MSA patients.
RESULTS: The median survival time from symptom onset to death (estimated using data from all patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis) was 6.3 (95% CI = 6.1-6.7) years. The survival model showed that a shorter survival time was associated with motor principal component (PC)1 (HR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.26-2.30, p < 0.001) and nonmotor PC3 (HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.31-2.10, p < 0.001) through PCA.

Thus, iRBD patients are the ideal target for disease-modifying therapy. The risk FActoRs PREdictive of phenoconversion in iRBD Italian STudy (FARPRESTO) is an ongoing Italian database aimed at identifying risk factors of phenoconversion, and eventually to ease clinical trial enrollment of well-characterized subjects.
METHODS: Polysomnography-confirmed iRBD patients were retrospectively and prospectively enrolled. Baseline harmonized clinical and nigrostriatal functioning data were collected at baseline. Nigrostriatal functioning was evaluated by dopamine transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) and categorized with visual semi-quantification. Longitudinal data were evaluated to assess phenoconversion. Cox regressions were applied to calculate hazard ratios.
RESULTS: 365 patients were enrolled, and 289 patients with follow-up (age 67.7 ± 7.3 years, 237 males, mean follow-up 40 ± 37 months) were included in this study. At follow-up, 97 iRBD patients (33.6%) phenoconverted to an overt synucleinopathy. Older age, motor and cognitive impairment, constipation, urinary and sexual dysfunction, depression, and visual semi-quantification of nigrostriatal functioning predicted phenoconversion. The remaining 268 patients are in follow-up within the FARPRESTO project.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical data (older age, motor and cognitive impairment, constipation, urinary and sexual dysfunction, depression) predicted phenoconversion in this multicenter, longitudinal, observational study. A standardized visual approach for semi-quantification of DaT-SPECT is proposed as a practical risk factor for phenoconversion in iRBD patients. Of note, non-converted and newly diagnosed iRBD patients, who represent a trial-ready cohort for upcoming disease-modification trials, are currently being enrolled and followed in the FARPRESTO study.

Validated data analysis approaches are necessary to evaluate disease-specific brain metabolism patterns in neurodegenerative disorders. This study compared the univariate Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) single-subject procedure and the multivariate Scaled Subprofile Model/Principal Component Analysis (SSM/PCA) in a cohort of patients with α-synucleinopathies.
METHODS: We included [18F]FDG-PET scans of 122 subjects within the α-synucleinopathy spectrum: Parkinson's Disease (PD) normal cognition on long-term follow-up (PD - low risk to dementia (LDR); n = 28), PD who developed dementia on clinical follow-up (PD - high risk of dementia (HDR); n = 16), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB; n = 67), and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA; n = 11). We also included [18F]FDG-PET scans of isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD; n = 51) subjects with a high risk of developing a manifest α-synucleinopathy. Each [18F]FDG-PET scan was compared with 112 healthy controls using SPM procedures. In the SSM/PCA approach, we computed the individual scores of previously identified patterns for PD, DLB, and MSA: PD-related patterns (PDRP), DLBRP, and MSARP. We used ROC curves to compare the diagnostic performances of SPM t-maps (visual rating) and SSM/PCA individual pattern scores in identifying each clinical condition across the spectrum. Specifically, we used the clinical diagnoses (""gold standard"") as our reference in ROC curves to evaluate the accuracy of the two methods. Experts in movement disorders and dementia made all the diagnoses according to the current clinical criteria of each disease (PD, DLB and MSA).
RESULTS: The visual rating of SPM t-maps showed higher performance (AUC: 0.995, specificity: 0.989, sensitivity 1.000) than PDRP z-scores (AUC: 0.818, specificity: 0.734, sensitivity 1.000) in differentiating PD-LDR from other α-synucleinopathies (PD-HDR, DLB and MSA). This result was mainly driven by the ability of SPM t-maps to reveal the limited or absent brain hypometabolism characteristics of PD-LDR. Both SPM t-maps visual rating and SSM/PCA z-scores showed high performance in identifying DLB (DLBRP = AUC: 0.909, specificity: 0.873, sensitivity 0.866; SPM t-maps = AUC: 0.892, specificity: 0.872, sensitivity 0.910) and MSA (MSARP: AUC: 0.921, specificity: 0.811, sensitivity 1.000; SPM t-maps: AUC: 1.000, specificity: 1.000, sensitivity 1.000) from other α-synucleinopathies. PD-HDR and DLB were comparable for the brain hypo and hypermetabolism patterns, thus not allowing differentiation by SPM t-maps or SSM/PCA. Of note, we found a gradual increase of PDRP and DLBRP expression in the continuum from iRBD to PD-HDR and DLB, where the DLB patients had the highest scores. SSM/PCA could differentiate iRBD from DLB, reflecting specifically the differences in disease staging and severity (AUC: 0.938, specificity: 0.821, sensitivity 0.941).
CONCLUSIONS: SPM-single subject maps and SSM/PCA are both valid methods in supporting diagnosis within the α-synucleinopathy spectrum, with different strengths and pitfalls. The former reveals dysfunctional brain topographies at the individual level with high accuracy for all the specific subtype patterns, and particularly also the normal maps; the latter provides a reliable quantification, independent from the rater experience, particularly in tracking the disease severity and staging. Thus, our findings suggest that differences in data analysis approaches exist and should be considered in clinical settings.

For instance, multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, is characterized by various combinations of progressive autonomic failure and motor dysfunction, and a very poor prognosis. Describing the progression of such complex and multi-dimensional diseases is particularly difficult. One has to simultaneously account for the assessment of multivariate markers over time, the occurrence of clinical endpoints, and a highly suspected heterogeneity between patients. Yet, such description is crucial for understanding the natural history of the disease, staging patients diagnosed with the disease, unravelling subphenotypes, and predicting the prognosis. Through the example of MSA progression, we show how a latent class approach modeling multiple repeated markers and clinical endpoints can help describe complex disease progression and identify subphenotypes for exploring new pathological hypotheses. The proposed joint latent class model includes class-specific multivariate mixed models to handle multivariate repeated biomarkers possibly summarized into latent dimensions and class-and-cause-specific proportional hazard models to handle time-to-event data. Maximum likelihood estimation procedure, validated through simulations is available in the lcmm R package.

Regional, in contrast to genome-wide, genetic correlations between pairs of immune and neurodegenerative traits have not been comprehensively explored, but could uncover additional immune-mediated risk-associated loci. Here, we systematically assess the role of the immune system in five neurodegenerative diseases by estimating regional genetic correlations between these diseases and immune-cell-derived single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTLs). We also investigate correlations between diseases and protein levels. We observe significant (FDR < 0.01) correlations between sc-eQTLs and neurodegenerative diseases across 151 unique genes, spanning both the innate and adaptive immune systems, across most diseases tested. With Parkinson's, for instance, RAB7L1 in CD4+ naïve T cells is positively correlated and KANSL1-AS1 is negatively correlated across all adaptive immune cell types.

As a result, accurate premortem diagnosis is challenging for neurologists, hindering efforts for disease-modifying therapeutic discovery. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain cell-state-specific biomolecules and can cross the blood-brain barrier to the peripheral circulation, providing a unique central nervous system (CNS) insight. This meta-analysis evaluated blood-isolated neuronal and oligodendroglial EVs (nEVs and oEVs) α-synuclein levels in Parkinsonian disorders.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, the meta-analysis included 13 studies. An inverse-variance random-effects model quantified effect size (SMD), QUADAS-2 assessed risk of bias and publication bias was evaluated. Demographic and clinical variables were collected for meta-regression.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 1,565 patients with PD, 206 with MSA, 21 with DLB, 172 with PSP, 152 with CBS and 967 healthy controls (HCs). Findings suggest that combined concentrations of nEVs and oEVs α-syn is higher in patients with PD compared to HCs (SMD = 0.21, p = 0.021), while nEVs α-syn is lower in patients with PSP and CBS compared to patients with PD (SMD = -1.04, p = 0.0017) or HCs (SMD = -0.41, p < 0.001). Additionally, α-syn in nEVs and/or oEVs did not significantly differ in patients with PD vs. MSA, contradicting the literature.

In this study, we examined the prevalence of freezing of gait and its relationship to clinical features in a large cohort of Chinese MSA patients.
METHODS: This exploratory study included 202 Chinese patients with probable MSA. FOG was defined as a score ≥ 1 on item 14 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Patients with or without FOG were compared in terms of the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) as well as cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments.
RESULTS: The frequency of FOG was 48.0, 52.1, and 38.7% in MSA, MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), and MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C), respectively. FOG was associated with worse subscores on parts I, II and IV of the UMSARS as well as worse total UMSARS score; greater likelihood of speech difficulties, falls, gait impairment and balance disorder; more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression; and lower activities of daily living. The binary logistic regression model indicated that higher total UMSARS scores were associated with FOG in MSA, MSA-P, and MSA-C patients.

Active and passive immunotherapies targeting insoluble, aggregated α-synuclein are already being actively explored in the clinic with mixed outcomes so far. Here, we report the identification of 306C7B3, a highly selective, aggregate-specific α-synuclein antibody with picomolar affinity devoid of binding to the monomeric, physiologic protein. 306C7B3 binding is Ser129-phosphorylation independent and shows high affinity to several different aggregated α-synuclein polymorphs, increasing the likelihood that it can also bind to the pathological seeds assumed to drive disease progression in patients. In support of this, highly selective binding to pathological aggregates in postmortem brains of MSA patients was demonstrated, with no staining in samples from other human neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve CNS exposure of 306C7B3, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based approach driving expression of the secreted antibody within the brain of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-hα-synuclein mice was used. Widespread central transduction after intrastriatal inoculation was ensured by using the AAV2HBKO serotype, with transduction being spread to areas far away from the inoculation site. Treatment of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-hα-synuclein mice at the age of 12 months demonstrated significantly increased survival, with 306C7B3 concentration reaching 3.9 nM in the cerebrospinal fluid. These results suggest that AAV-mediated expression of 306C7B3, targeting extracellular, presumably disease-propagating aggregates of α-synuclein, has great potential as a disease-modifying therapy for α-synucleinopathies as it ensures CNS exposure of the antibody, thereby mitigating the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier.","2023",,"NPJ Parkinsons Dis",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

ALS pathophysiology is characterized by involvement of multiple processes, including oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. Moreover, it is proposed that conditioning risk factors affect ALS development, such as susceptibility to neurodegeneration in motor neurons, the intensity of performed physical activity, and intestinal dysbiosis with involvement of the enteric nervous system, which supports the existing theories of disease generation.

Studies exploring the mechanistic connection between vascular disease and MS disease progression are scant. We hypothesized that phosphate energy metabolism impairment in PwMS with VDRFs (VDRF+) will be greater compared to PwMS without VDRFs (VDRF-) and is related to increased brain atrophy in VDRF+. To test this hypothesis, we planned to study the differences in the high energy phosphate (HEP) metabolites in cerebral gray matter as assessed by

Two therapies that alter splicing of the Survival Motor Neuron 2 (SMN2) gene, i.e. nusinersen and risdiplam, improve motor function in SMA, but treatment effects vary. Experimental studies indicate that motor unit dysfunction encompasses multiple features, including abnormal function of the motor neuron, axon, neuromuscular junction and muscle fibres. The relative contributions of dysfunction of different parts of the motor unit to the clinical phenotype are unknown. Predictive biomarkers for clinical efficacy are currently lacking. The goals of this project are to study the association of electrophysiological abnormalities of the peripheral motor system in relation to 1) SMA clinical phenotypes and 2) treatment response in patients treated with SMN2-splicing modifiers (nusinersen or risdiplam).
METHODS: We designed an investigator-initiated, monocentre, longitudinal cohort study using electrophysiological techniques ('the SMA Motor Map') in Dutch children (≥ 12 years) and adults with SMA types 1-4. The protocol includes the compound muscle action potential scan, nerve excitability testing and repetitive nerve stimulation test, executed unilaterally at the median nerve. Part one cross-sectionally assesses the association of electrophysiological abnormalities in relation to SMA clinical phenotypes in treatment-naïve patients. Part two investigates the predictive value of electrophysiological changes at two-months treatment for a positive clinical motor response after one-year treatment with SMN2-splicing modifiers. We will include 100 patients in each part of the study.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information on the pathophysiology of the peripheral motor system of treatment-naïve patients with SMA through electrophysiological techniques. More importantly, the longitudinal analysis in patients on SMN2-splicing modifying therapies (i.e. nusinersen and risdiplam) intents to develop non-invasive electrophysiological biomarkers for treatment response in order to improve (individualized) treatment decisions.

It is unknown how MSA is triggered and these observations in prodromal MSA led us to hypothesize that synucleinopathy could be triggered by infection of the genitourinary tract causing ɑ-synuclein (ɑSyn) to aggregate in peripheral nerves innervating these organs. As a first proof that peripheral infections could act as a trigger in MSA, this study focused on lower urinary tract infections (UTIs), given the relevance and high frequency of UTIs in prodromal MSA, although other types of infection might also be important triggers of MSA. We performed an epidemiological nested-case control study in the Danish population showing that UTIs are associated with future diagnosis of MSA several years after infection and that it impacts risk in both men and women. Bacterial infection of the urinary bladder triggers synucleinopathy in mice and we propose a novel role of ɑSyn in the innate immune system response to bacteria. Urinary tract infection with uropathogenic E. coli results in the de novo aggregation of ɑSyn during neutrophil infiltration. During the infection, ɑSyn is released extracellularly from neutrophils as part of their extracellular traps. Injection of MSA aggregates into the urinary bladder leads to motor deficits and propagation of ɑSyn pathology to the central nervous system in mice overexpressing oligodendroglial ɑSyn. Repeated UTIs lead to progressive development of synucleinopathy with oligodendroglial involvement in vivo.

However, the evolution of these processes and their prognostic values are unknown in patients with AKI.METHODSIn a prospective cohort of 656 participants hospitalized with AKI, we measured 7 urine and 2 plasma biomarkers of kidney injury, inflammation, and tubular health at multiple time points from the diagnosis to 12 months after AKI. We used linear mixed-effect models to estimate biomarker changes over time, and we used Cox proportional hazard regressions to determine their associations with a composite outcome of chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression. We compared the gene expression kinetics of biomarkers in murine models of repair and atrophy after ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI).RESULTSAfter 4.3 years, 106 and 52 participants developed incident CKD and CKD progression, respectively. Each SD increase in the change of urine KIM-1, MCP-1, and plasma TNFR1 from baseline to 12 months was associated with 2- to 3-fold increased risk for CKD, while the increase in urine uromodulin was associated with 40% reduced risk for CKD. The trajectories of these biological processes were associated with progression to kidney atrophy in mice after IRI.CONCLUSIONSustained tissue injury and inflammation, and slower restoration of tubular health, are associated with higher risk of kidney disease progression.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the complete fusion gene sequences classified the three study isolates into genotype XXI (sub-genotype XXI.1.2) together with recent NDV isolates obtained from pigeons in Pakistan (2014-2018). The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that the ancestor of Bangladeshi pigeon NDVs and the viruses from sub-genotype XXI.1.2 existed in the late 1990s. Pathogenicity testing using mean embryo death time pathotyped the viruses as mesogenic, while all isolates carried multiple basic amino acid residues at the fusion protein cleavage site. Experimental infection of chickens and pigeons revealed no or minimum clinical signs in chickens, while a relatively high morbidity (70%) and mortality (60%) were observed in pigeons. The infected pigeons showed extensive and systemic lesions including hemorrhagic and/or vascular changes in the conjunctiva, respiratory and digestive system and brain, and atrophy in the spleen, while only mild congestion in the lungs was noticed in the inoculated chickens. Histologically, consolidation in the lungs with collapsed alveoli and edema around the blood vessels, hemorrhages in the trachea, severe hemorrhages and congestion, focal aggregation of mononuclear cells, and single hepatocellular necrosis in the liver, severe congestion, multifocal tubular degeneration, and necrosis, as well as mononuclear cell infiltration in the renal parenchyma, encephalomalacia with severe neuronal necrosis with neuronophagia were noticed in the brain in infected pigeons. In contrast, only slight congestion was found in lungs of the infected chickens. qRT-PCR revealed the replication of the virus in both pigeons and chickens; however, higher viral RNA loads were observed in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, respiratory tissues, and spleen of infected pigeons than the chickens. In conclusion, genotype XXI.1.2 NDVs are circulating in the pigeon population of Bangladesh since 1990s, produce high mortality in pigeons with pneumonia, hepatocellular necrosis, renal tubular degeneration, and neuronal necrosis in pigeons, and may infect chickens without overt signs of clinical disease and are likely to shed viruses via the oral or cloacal routes.","2023",,"Microb Pathog",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Newcastle disease virus, FALSE, Columbidae, FALSE, Chickens, FALSE, Newcastle Disease, TRUE, Virulence, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Phylogeny, FALSE, Bayes Theorem, FALSE, Necrosis, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Poultry Diseases, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

An early diagnosis of multiple system atrophy is of utmost importance for the proper prevention and management of its potentially fatal complications leading to the poor prognosis of these patients. The current diagnostic criteria incorporate several clinical red flags and magnetic resonance imaging markers supporting diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Nonetheless, especially in the early disease stage, it can be challenging to differentiate multiple system atrophy from mimic disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease. Electromyography of the external anal sphincter represents a useful neurophysiological tool for differential diagnosis since it can provide indirect evidence of Onuf's nucleus degeneration, which is a pathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy. However, the diagnostic value of external anal sphincter electromyography has been a matter of debate for three decades due to controversial reports in the literature. In this review, after a brief overview of the electrophysiological methodology, we first aimed to critically analyze the available knowledge on the diagnostic role of external anal sphincter electromyography. We discussed the conflicting evidence on the clinical correlations of neurogenic abnormalities found at external anal sphincter electromyography.

Satralizumab, a humanized, monoclonal recycling antibody that targets the interleukin-6 receptor, reduced NMOSD relapse risk vs. placebo in two Phase 3 trials: SAkuraSky (satralizumab ± immunosuppressive therapy; NCT02028884) and SAkuraStar (satralizumab monotherapy; NCT02073279). Satralizumab is approved to treat aquaporin-4 IgG-seropositive (AQP4-IgG+) NMOSD. SAkuraBONSAI (NCT05269667) will explore fluid and imaging biomarkers to better understand the mechanism of action of satralizumab and the neuronal and immunological changes following treatment in AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD.
OBJECTIVES: SAkuraBONSAI will evaluate clinical disease activity measures, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), pharmacokinetics, and safety of satralizumab in AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. Correlations between imaging markers (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and optical coherence tomography [OCT]) and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers will be investigated.
STUDY DESIGN: SAkuraBONSAI is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, international, Phase 4 study that will enroll approximately 100 adults (18-74 years) with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. This study includes two patient cohorts: newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients (Cohort 1; 
ENDPOINTS: Disease activity related to relapses (proportion relapse-free, annualized relapse rate, time to relapse, and relapse severity), disability progression (Expanded Disability Status Scale), cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), and ophthalmological changes (visual acuity; National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25) will all be assessed.

The brain weights of patients with dntNCIs were lower than those without dntNCIs. The presence of dementia was similar among the dntNCI subtypes. The pAS-dntNCI subtype was associated with longer survival and smaller brain weights; the pT-dntNCI subtype exhibited more frequent tau pathologies than the pAS-dntNCI subtype. Thus, MSA with dntNCIs is a possible pathological subtype of longer survivors that correlates with longer disease duration, prolonged tracheostomy, and high frequency of dementia.

Given inherent stressors affecting OLs, the objective of the present study was to discuss the possible role of amyloidogenic evolvability (aEVO) in these conditions. Hypothetically, in aEVO, protofibrils of amyloidogenic proteins (APs), including β-synuclein and β-amyloid, might form in response to diverse stressors in parental brain. Subsequently, the AP protofibrils might be transmitted to offspring via germ cells in a prion-like fashion. By virtue of the stress information conferred by protofibrillar APs, the OLs in offspring's brain might be more resilient to forthcoming stressors, perhaps reducing MS risk. aEVO could be comparable to a gene for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. On the contrary, during ageing, MSA risk is increased through antagonistic pleiotropy. Consistently, the expression levels of APs are reduced in MS, but are increased in MSA compared to controls. Furthermore, β-synuclein, the non-amyloidogenic homologue of β-synuclein, might exert a buffering effect on aEVO, and abnormal β-synuclein could also increase MS and MSA disease activity.

In cross-sectional studies, sNfL has been associated with disease activity and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes; however, it is still unclear to what extent in particular high sNfL levels impact on subsequent disease evolution.
METHODS: sNfL was quantified by an ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) in 199 pwMS (median age = 34.2 years, 64.3% female) and 49 controls. All pwMS underwent 3-T MRI to assess global and compartmental normalized brain volumes, T2-lesion load, and cortical mean thickness. Follow-up data and serum samples were available in 144 pwMS (median follow-up time = 3.8 years). Linear and binary logistic models were used to estimate the independent contribution of sNfL for changes in MRI and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Age-corrected sNfL z-scores from a normative database of healthy controls were used for sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: High sNfL levels at baseline were associated with atrophy measures of the whole brain (standardized beta coefficient βj = -0.352, p < 0.001), white matter (βj = -0.229, p = 0.007), thalamus (βj = -0.372, p = 0.004), and putamen (βj = -1.687, p = 0.012). pwMS with high levels of sNfL at baseline and follow-up had a greater risk of EDSS worsening (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Already single time point elevation of sNfL has a distinct effect on brain volume changes over a short-term period, and repeated high levels of sNfL indicate accumulating physical disability.

However, no studies have investigated whether the asynchronous age-related decline in GMP is related to degenerative changes in brain structure. In this study, the random dot kinematogram paradigm and structural magnetic resonance imaging were used to investigate the asynchronous aging of GMP at fast and slow speeds (called fast GMP and slow GMP, respectively) and their relationships with brain structure. Ninety-four older adults (65.74 ± 4.50 yrs) and 90 younger adults (22.83 ± 4.84 yrs) participated in the experiment. The results showed that older adults had higher motion coherence thresholds (MCT) than younger adults at both fast and slow speeds. Brain-behavior correlation analyses of younger adults revealed that none of the correlations between morphological measures and MCTs survived correction for multiple comparisons. For older adults, slow MCT was correlated with cortical thickness in the bilateral V4v, V5/MT+, left V7, V8, LO, and surface area in the right V7. Fast MCT was significantly correlated with gray matter volume in the right V7 and thickness in the left V5/MT+. These results support the view that global motion extraction occurs within two speed-tuned systems that are at least partially independent in terms of their neural substrates, which deteriorate with age at different speeds. Aging of GMP is also associated with morphological changes in the visual cortex. Age-related cerebral atrophy in the dorsal stream may impair both fast and slow GMP, whereas aging of the ventral stream specifically impairs slow GMP.","2023",,"Neuropsychologia"," In this study , the random dot kinematogram paradigm and structural magnetic resonance imaging were used to investigate the asynchronous aging of GMP at fast and slow speeds ( called fast GMP and slow GMP , respectively ) and their relationships with brain structure ","other","Humans, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Motion Perception, TRUE, Aging, FALSE, Visual Cortex, TRUE, Eye Movements, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Photic Stimulation, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Central to this regulation is the role of several molecular chaperones that ensure the correct interactions between RNA and proteins, while aiding the biogenesis of large RNA-protein complexes (ribonucleoproteins or RNPs). Accurate formation of RNPs is fundamentally important to cellular development and function, and its impairment often leads to disease. The survival motor neuron (SMN) protein exemplifies this biological paradigm. SMN is part of a multi-protein complex essential for the biogenesis of various RNPs that function in RNA metabolism. Mutations leading to SMN deficiency cause the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A fundamental question in SMA biology is how selective motor system dysfunction results from reduced levels of the ubiquitously expressed SMN protein. Recent clarification of the central role of the SMN complex in RNA metabolism and a thorough characterization of animal models of SMA have significantly advanced our knowledge of the molecular basis of the disease. Here we review the expanding role of SMN in the regulation of gene expression through its multiple functions in RNP biogenesis.

OBJECTIVES: To study the differential evolution of both conditions including plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers.
METHODS: SPORTAX is a prospective registry of sporadic ataxia patients with an onset >40 years. Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia was the primary outcome measure. In subgroups, blood samples were taken and MRIs performed. Plasma NfL was measured via a single molecule assay. Regional brain volumes were automatically measured. To assess signal changes, we defined the pons and middle cerebellar peduncle abnormality score (PMAS). Using mixed-effects models, we analyzed changes on a time scale starting with ataxia onset.
RESULTS: Of 404 patients without genetic diagnosis, 130 met criteria of probable MSA-C at baseline and 26 during follow-up suggesting clinical conversion to MSA-C. The remaining 248 were classified as SAOA. At baseline, NfL, cerebellar white matter (CWM) and pons volume, and PMAS separated MSA-C from SAOA. NfL decreased in MSA-C and did not change in SAOA. CWM and pons volume decreased faster, whereas PMAS increased faster in MSA-C. In MSA-C, pons volume had highest sensitivity to change, and PMAS was a predictor of faster progression.

This systematic review and expert focus-group study was designed to obtain evidence from published data and clinical experiences of Korean movement-disorder specialists about the efficacy and safety of atomoxetine for the pharmacological treatment of nOH in patients with α-synucleinopathies.
METHODS: The study comprised a systematic review and a focus-group discussion with clinicians. For the systematic review, multiple comprehensive databases including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and KoreaMed were searched to retrieve articles that assessed the outcomes of atomoxetine therapy. A focus-group discussion was additionally performed to solicit opinions from experts with experience in managing nOH.
RESULTS: The literature review process yielded only four randomized controlled trials on atomoxetine matching the inclusion criteria.

METHODS: Twenty-four patients with clinical probable multiple system atrophy (MSA), 34 with probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 58 with sex- and age-matched Parkinson's disease (PD) were enrolled.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the presence of NPH-like MRI features is much higher in PSP patients, and this tendency is decided upon the determination of parkinsonism subtype. Sharing pathophysiological characteristics in these two diseases is implied. More diagnostic tools are needed to better differentiate the two diseases and decide the treatment. To closely observe hydrocephalic parkinsonism patients and well inform the possible limited shunting benefits if PSP core features appear, will be more pivotal and practical at present clinical practice.","2023",,"Brain Behav"," OBJECTIVES : The classic triad of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH ) encompass gait disturbance , cognitive impairment , and urinary incontinence ","other","Humans, FALSE, Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Prevalence, FALSE, Parkinsonian Disorders, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Multiple System Atrophy, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

We sought to explore the lifelong association of constipation and PD, DLB, PDD, and MSA (α-Synucleinopathies), compared to age- and sex-matched controls.
METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), we established an incident cohort of clinically defined α-synucleinopathies. A movement-disorder specialist reviewed all medical charts to establish clinical diagnoses.
RESULTS: We identified 453 incident cases of clinically diagnosed α-synucleinopathies and an identical number of age- and sex-matched controls in Olmsted County (MN), 1991-2010. There were 303 cases of PD; 80, DLB; 54, PDD; and 16, MSA. Approximately 50% of α-synucleinopathies of all types reported constipation, compared to 27% in controls. The earliest pre-motor onset constipation was in DLB (median, 3.76 years prior to α-synucleinopathies motor-symptom onset); latest onset post-motor constipation was in PD (median, 5.15 years after motor-symptom onset). PD also had the highest longstanding constipation rate (18.2%). All α-synucleinopathies had higher odds of constipation compared to controls, except for MSA (p = 0.09), likely due to a limited sample size.
CONCLUSION: PD, DLB, and PDD had higher odds of constipation compared to controls; PD had the most widespread onset of lifelong constipation, both longstanding and pre- or post-motor onset symptoms. Our results indicate that constipation rates do not differ among α-synucleinopathies but do differ in terms of temporal onset compared to disease onset.","2023",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord"," We sought to explore the lifelong association of constipation and PD , DLB , PDD , and MSA ( α-Synucleinopathies ) , compared to age- and sex-matched controls ","other","Humans, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Chronic Disease, FALSE, Constipation, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Dementia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Lewy Body Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Minnesota, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Synucleinopathies, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

To avoid invasive testing and painful physical examinations, validated questionaries, which can assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with symptoms of GSM. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with GSM in middle-aged and older women in the communities of Beijing, China.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, questionnaire study was performed among 35-70 years old Chinese woman. Vaginal health index score and urinary distress inventory (UDI-6) was used to evaluate vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and urinary incontinence (UI). Stages of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) was measured during gynecological examination with POP-Q system. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) and proportion/percentages were used to summarize continuous and categorial variables respectively. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: A total of 2702/3000 participants completed the questionnaire survey. The mean ± SD age of participants was 53.7 ± 7.0 years and prevalence of VVA among participants was 34.8% (941/2702). In UDI-6 questionnaires total 47.5% (1284/2702) participants reported experiencing urinary incontinence (UI). Further, POP was highly prevalent in anterior vaginal wall 38.9% (1050/2702) followed by posterior vaginal wall 25.3% (683/2702) and uterine 22.2% (599/2702). Besides, multiple logistic regression analysis inferred older age (45-54 years [OR (95% CI): 3.38 (2.03, 5.64)]; 55-64 years [OR (95% CI): 8.63 (5.09, 14.64)]), menopause [OR (95% CI): 2.20 (1.71, 2.85)] and Faecal Inconsistence (FI) [OR (95% CI): 1.31(1.00, 1.72)] as independent risk factors for VVA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study evidenced that GSM is prevalent in old age Chinese women. GSM is related with UI, POP and VVA. Further older age, menopause and FI were risk factors associated with VVA. Our findings could help health care personnel to get a comprehensive overview of factors associated with VVA and urinal distress, which may facilitate early detection and prevention of GSM.","2022",,"BMC Womens Health"," We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with GSM in middle-aged and older women in the communities of Beijing , China "," review","Middle Aged, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Beijing, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prevalence, FALSE, Menopause, FALSE, Vagina, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Urinary Incontinence, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Risk Factors, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, Vaginal Diseases, TRUE, pathology, Q000473",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Generally, health care resources are disproportionately expended in the last year of life. Health care utilization by those with neurodegenerative movement disorders in the last year of life is not well-understood. The goal of this study was to assess the utilization of acute care in the last year of life among individuals with neurodegenerative movement disorders and determine whether outpatient neurology or palliative care affected acute care utilization and place of death.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study including health system administrative data in Alberta, Canada, from 2011 to 2017. Administrative data were used to determine place of death and quantify emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and outpatient generalist and specialist visits. Diagnoses were classified by 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases codes. Stata 16v was used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS: Among 1439 individuals (60% male), Parkinson disease (n = 1226), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 78), multiple system atrophy (n = 47), and Huntington disease (n = 58) were the most common diagnoses. The most frequent place of death was in hospital (45.9%), followed by long-term care (36.3%), home (7.9%), and residential hospice (4.0%). Most (64.2%) had >1 ED visit, and 14.4% had >3 emergency department visits. Fifty-five percent had >1 hospitalization, and 23.3% spent >30 days in hospital. Few (2.6%) were admitted to ICU. Only 37.2% and 8.8% accessed outpatient neurologist and specialist palliative care services, respectively.

The aim is to evaluate the association between OH and dementia risk in patients with PD, and cognitive impairment risk in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and to explore relevant clinical and neuropathologic factors to understand underlying pathogenic mechanisms.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Medical records throughout the entire disease course of consecutive patients with neuropathology-confirmed PD and MSA from the Queen Square Brain Bank were systematically reviewed. Time of onset and severity of OH-related symptoms were documented, and their association with other clinical and neuropathologic variables was evaluated. Dementia risk for patients with PD and cognitive impairment risk for patients with MSA were estimated using multivariable hazard regression.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients with PD and 137 with MSA were included. Patients with MSA developed OH more frequently, earlier in the disease course and with more severe symptoms. Cumulative dementia prevalence was higher in patients with PD. Multivariable adjusted regression models showed that early OH, but not its symptom severity, increased dementia risk in patients with PD by 14% per year (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93) and cognitive impairment risk in patients with MSA by 41% per year (HR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42-0.83). Early OH was not associated with increased α-synuclein, β-amyloid, tau, Alzheimer, or cerebrovascular pathologies. No significant associations were found between severity of OH symptoms and other clinical or neuropathologic variables.
DISCUSSION: Early OH, but not its symptom severity, increases the risk of cognitive impairment in patients with PD and MSA. OH is not associated with more extensive Lewy, β-amyloid, tau, Alzheimer, or cerebrovascular pathologies. It is likely that OH contributes to cognitive impairment in patients with PD and MSA by hypoxia-induced nonspecific neurodegeneration.

Yet, growing evidence indicates currently the commonness of such deficits among MSA patients in different populations. Our aim was to evaluate the cognitive profile of MSA Tunisian patients and to analyze the underlying clinical and genetic determinants.
METHODS: In a retrospective cross-sectional study, clinically-diagnosed MSA patients were included. All subjects underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments to characterize their cognitive profile. The associations with their APOE genotype status were analyzed. Determinant of CI were specified.
RESULTS: We included 71 MSA patients. Female gender(sex-ratio = 0.65) and MSA-P subtype(73%) were predominant. Mean age of disease onset was 59.1years. CI was found in 85.7% of patients(dementia in 12.7% and Mild cognitive impairment(MCI) in 73% of patients mainly of multiple-domain amnestic type(37.3%)). Mean MMSE score was lower among MSA-P compared to MSA-C(23.52 vs. 26.47;p = 0.027). Higher postural instability gait disorder(PIGD) and MDS-UPDRS-III scores were noted in demented MSA patients(p = 0.019;p = 0.015 respectively). The main altered cognitive domain was attention(64.8%). Executive functions and mood disorders were more affected in MSA-P(p = 0.029,p = 0.035 respectively). Clinical and neurophysiological study of dysautonomia revealed no differences across cognitive subtypes. APOE genotyping was performed in 51 MSA patients with available blood samples. Those carrying APOEε4 had 1.32 fold higher risk to develop CI, with lower MMSE score(p = 0.0001). Attention and language were significantly altered by adjusting the p value to APOEɛ4 carriers(p = 0.046 and p = 0.044 respectively). Executive dysfunction was more pronounced among MSA-PAPOEε4 carriers(p = 0.010).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the main determinants of CI in Tunisian MSA patients were MSA-P motor-subtype, mainly of PIGD-phenotype, disease duration and APOEε4 carrying status, defining a more altered cognitive phenotype. This effect mainly concerned executive, attention and language functions, all found to be more impaired in APOEε4 carriers with variable degrees across MSA motor-subtypes.","2022",,"PLoS One"," Our aim was to evaluate the cognitive profile of MSA Tunisian patients and to analyze the underlying clinical and genetic determinants ","other","Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies, including pilot studies.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults with progressive neurologic diseases (dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy) and their caregivers.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL PLUS, Cochrane CENTRAL, and PubMed were searched from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tools. Narrative synthesis was conducted. Patient quality of life (QoL), symptom burden, caregiver burden, and satisfaction with care were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Fifteen trials provided data on 3431 patients (mean age, 73.9 years). Compared with usual care, palliative care was statistically significantly associated with lower symptom burden [standardized mean difference (SMD), -0.34 (95% Cl, -0.59 to -0.09)] and higher caregiver satisfaction [SMD, 0.41 (95% Cl, 0.12 to 0.71)] and patient satisfaction [SMD, 0.43 (95% Cl, -0.01 to 0.87)]. However, the associations were not significant after excluding studies with high risk of bias.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Palliative care is likely to improve symptom burden and satisfaction with care among patients with progressive neurologic diseases and their caregivers, while its effects on QoL and caregiver burden remains inconclusive. Specific intervention components including interdisciplinary team, palliative care physicians, home visits, and spiritual care appeared to be associated with increased effects on improving palliative outcomes.

Small vessels in the kidney include small-sized arteries, capillaries, and venules. Intrarenal C4 deposits are now increasingly recognized as a potential marker and pathogenic mechanism of autoantibody-mediated tissue damage in ANCA-associated renal vasculitis. We here describe the relevance of complement C4 deposits localized to distinct vascular compartments in a cohort of biopsy-proven ANCA-associated renal vasculitis. A cohort of 43 biopsy-proven cases of ANCA-associated renal vasculitis with myeloperoxidase (MPO) or proteinase 3 (PR3) seropositivity were retrospectively enrolled in a single-center observational study. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with intrarenal C4 deposits in ANCA-associated renal vasculitis. We here show that C4 deposits localize to distinct vascular compartments in ANCA-associated renal vasculitis, and provide evidence for an association with better short-term survival (p = 0.008), implicating that this subgroup had a superior response to remission induction therapy. Second, C4 deposits in interlobular arteries were associated with eosinophilic infiltrates in renal vasculitis with MPO-ANCA seropositivity (p = 0.021). In renal vasculitis positive for MPO-ANCA, the absence of C4 deposits in the glomerular tuft was associated with sclerotic class ANCA-associated renal vasculitis (p < 0.001), and tubular RBC casts (p = 0.024). Fourth, complement C4 in interlobular arteries is associated with tubular atrophy specifically in renal vasculitis with PR3-ANCA seropositivity (p = 0.006). Finally, complement C4 deposits in peritubular capillaries associated specifically with hyaline casts in cases positive for PR3-ANCA (p = 0.025), implicating a role in tubular injury. Interestingly, C4 deposits were localized to distinct vascular compartments independent of the systemic activation of the complement system, reflected by the consumption of respective serum complement molecules in ANCA-associated renal vasculitis. In summary, we here show that C4 deposits localize to distinct vascular compartments in ANCA-associated renal vasculitis, and provide evidence for an association with survival and distinct histopathological lesions. Considering recent advances in AAV therapy with the emergence of new therapeutics that inhibit complement activation, we here provide novel insights into complement C4 as a potential marker to identify patients who may benefit most from these drugs. Thus, our results may contribute to a more personalized treatment approach of AAV depending on the relevance of distinct intrarenal complement deposits.","2022",,"Int J Mol Sci",,"observational study","Humans, FALSE, Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic, FALSE, Complement C4, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis, TRUE, pathology, Q000473, Myeloblastin, FALSE, Kidney, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Kidney Diseases, TRUE, etiology, Q000209, Biomarkers, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Approximately 12 to 42% of those who fall will have an injury. Further, once individuals fall, they are 50% more likely to have a second fall. In this population, a fall is associated with restricted mobility, a decline in activities of daily living (ADLs), hip fracture and other musculoskeletal injuries, dehydration, pneumonia, and long-term hospitalization. Moreover, a fear of falling compromises the patient’s independence and mobility, affecting overall physical and mental health. Fortunately, many falls are preventable using appropriate screening modalities and prevention interventions. Falls are often multi-factorial, considering there is usually a disturbance in gait and balance. Some causes include sarcopenia, muscle atrophy and imbalance, improper bio-mechanics, poor-blood pressure control, home environment, and polypharmacy. The pathologies on this list can be identified through screening modalities. One screening modality that can be used in many different settings such as outpatient primary care, inpatient hospital ward, or physical therapy office is the Tinetti gait and balance assessment, also known as the performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA). This test is useful because it can be applied to different patient populations, including the elderly, patients with Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke patients.

Patients with SMA may have multiple tissue defects, which could present prior to neuromuscular symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the signs, comorbidities and potential extraneural manifestations associated with SMA in treatment-naïve patients.
METHODS: This observational, retrospective and matched-cohort study used secondary insurance claims data from the US IBM® MarketScan® Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare Supplemental databases between 01/01/2000 and 12/31/2013. Treatment-naïve individuals aged≤65 years with≥2 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) SMA codes were stratified into four groups (A-D), according to age at index (date of first SMA code recorded) and type of ICD-9 code used, and matched with non-SMA controls. The occurrence of ICD-9 codes, which were converted to various classifications (phecodes and system classes), were compared between groups in pre- and post-index periods.
RESULTS: A total of 1,457 individuals with SMA were included and matched to 13,362 controls. Increasing numbers of SMA-associated phecodes and system classes were generally observed from pre- to post-index across all groups. The strongest associations were observed in the post-index period for the youngest age groups. Endocrine/metabolic disorders were associated with SMA in almost all groups and across time periods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was divided into three groups: 47 patients with MSA, 125 patients with PD, and 124 healthy controls. The corresponding laboratory indicators of subjects were collected and analyzed to obtain MHR, NLR, and RPR values.
RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the MHR, NLR, and RPR were higher in the MSA group (

With novel treatments now available, new evaluation methods are needed to assess progress that is not currently captured in existing motor scale tests.
OBJECTIVE: With our feasibility study, our interdisciplinary team of investigators aims to develop a novel, multimodal paradigm of measuring motor function in children with neuromuscular diseases that will revolutionize the way that clinical trial end points are measured, thereby accelerating the pipeline of new treatments for childhood neuromuscular diseases. Through the Upper Extremity Examination for Neuromuscular Diseases (U-EXTEND) study, we hypothesize that the novel objective measures of upper extremity muscle structure and function proposed herein will be able to capture small changes and differences in function that cannot be measured with current clinical metrics.
METHODS: U-EXTEND introduces a novel paradigm in which concrete, quantitative measures are used to assess motor function in patients with SMA and DMD. Aim 1 will focus on the use of ultrasound techniques to study muscle size, quality, and function, specifically isolating the biceps and pronator muscles of the upper extremities for follow-ups over time. To achieve this, clinical investigators will extract a set of measurements related to muscle structure, quality, and function by using ultrasound imaging and handheld dynamometry. Aim 2 will focus on leveraging wearable wireless sensor technology to capture motion data as participants perform activities of daily living. Measurement data will be examined and compared to those from a healthy cohort, and a motor function score will be calculated.
RESULTS: Data collection for both aims began in January 2021. As of July 2022, we have enrolled 44 participants (9 with SMA, 20 with DMD, and 15 healthy participants). We expect the initial results to be published in summer 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that by applying the described tools and techniques for measuring muscle structure and upper extremity function, we will have created a system for the precise quantification of changes in motor function among patients with neuromuscular diseases. Our study will allow us to track the minimal clinically important difference over time to assess progress in novel treatments. By comparing the muscle scores and functional scores over multiple visits, we will be able to detect small changes in both the ability of the participants to perform the functional tasks and their intrinsic muscle properties.

We aimed to examine iRBD patient values and preferences regarding prognostic counseling.
METHODS: One hundred thirteen iRBD patient participants enrolled in the Mayo Clinic iRBD Patient Registry were sent an email survey concerning their values and preferences concerning NDD prognostic counseling and their experiences following diagnosis with iRBD.
RESULTS: Of 81 respondents (71.7% response rate), the majority were men (74.0%) with an average age of 65.7 (±9.7) years. Responses indicated a strong preference toward receiving prognostic information about possible future NDD development. 92.5% of respondents felt knowledge concerning personal NDD risk was important, while 87.6% indicated prognostic discussions were important to maintaining trust in their physician. 95.7% indicated a desire for more information, while only 4.3% desired less information regarding their NDD prognostic risk. Most respondents strongly agreed that prognostic information was important to discuss with their family and friends and inform future life planning, and most expressed interest in learning more about future neuroprotective therapies and symptomatic treatments for parkinsonism and dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Most iRBD patients indicated strong preferences for disclosure of NDD prognostic risk and indicated that prognostic information was important for family discussions and future life planning.

The common clinical features are chronic progressive decline of motor, cognitive, behavioral, and autonomic functions. They include Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy body, and multiple system atrophy. Their etiology has not been clarified and multiple pathogenic factors include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein degradation systems, and neuroinflammation. Current available therapy cannot prevent progressive neurodegeneration and ""disease-modifying or neuroprotective"" therapy has been proposed. This paper presents the molecular mechanisms of neuroprotection by the inhibitors of type B monoamine oxidase, rasagiline and selegiline. They prevent mitochondrial apoptosis, induce anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family, and pro-survival brain- and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors. They also prevent toxic oligomerization and aggregation of α-synuclein. Monoamine oxidase is involved in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection, independently of the catalytic activity. Type A monoamine oxidases mediates rasagiline-activated signaling pathways to induce neuroprotective genes in neuronal cells. Multi-targeting propargylamine derivatives have been developed for therapy in various neurodegenerative diseases.

Furthermore, several families with multiple patients with MSA and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported. As genetic risk factors for MSA, functionally impaired variants in COQ2 and Gaucher-disease-causing GBA variants have been reported. While it has been established that GBA variants are associated with PD, COQ2 may also be associated with PD. In 672 patients with MSA, we identified 12 multiplex families of patients with MSA and PD in first-degree relatives. We conducted a detailed analysis of the clinical presentations of these patients and genetic analyses of GBA and COQ2. In the multiplex families, a patient with MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) was observed in nine families, while a patient with MSA cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) was observed in three families. Six families had siblings with MSA and PD, five families had a parent-offspring pair with MSA and PD, and in one family, a sibling and a parent of an MSA patient had PD. In genetic analyses of these patients, GBA variants were identified in one of the 12 MSA patients and two of the seven PD patients. Functionally impaired variants of COQ2 were identified in two of the 12 MSA patients and not identified in the seven PD patients. This study further emphasizes the occurrence of MSA and PD in first-degree relatives, raising the possibility that a common genetic basis underlies MSA and PD.

The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in functional network when compared between MSA patients with and without freezing.
METHODS: Degree centrality (DC) based on the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was computed in 65 patients with MSA and 36 healthy controls. Brain regions with statistically different DC values between groups were selected as seed points for a second seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The relationships between brain activity (DC and FC alterations) and the severity of freezing symptoms were then investigated in the two groups of patients with MSA.
RESULTS: Compared to MSA patients without FOG symptoms (MSA-nFOG), patients with MSA-FOG showed an increased DC in the left middle temporal gyrus but a reduced DC in the right superior pole temporal gyrus, left anterior cingulum cortex, left thalamus, and right middle frontal gyrus. Furthermore, in patients with MSA-FOG, the DC in the left thalamus was negatively correlated with FOG scores. Using the left thalamus as a seed, secondary seed-based functional connectivity analysis revealed that patients with MSA-FOG commonly showed the left thalamus-based FC abnormalities in regions related to cognition and emotion. In contrast to the patients with MSA-nFOG, patients with MSA-FOG showed an increased FC between the left thalamus and the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral cerebellum_8, and left precuneus.

VEPs may also reflect broader neural disturbances that extend beyond the visual system, but this possibility requires further investigation. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that delayed latency of the P100 component of the VEP would be associated with broader structural changes in the brain in PwMS. We obtained VEP latency for a standard pattern-reversal checkerboard stimulus paradigm, in addition to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measures of whole brain volume (WBV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) white matter lesion volume (FLV). Correlation analyses indicated that prolonged VEP latency was significantly associated with lower WBV, GMV, and WMV, and greater FLV. VEP latency remained significantly associated with WBV, GMV, and WMV even after controlling for the variance associated with inter-ocular latency, age, time between VEP and MRI assessments, and other MRI variables. VEP latency delays were most pronounced in PwMS that exhibited low volume in both white and gray matter simultaneously. Furthermore, PwMS that had delayed VEP latency based on a clinically relevant cutoff (VEP latency ≥ 113 ms) in both eyes had lower WBV, GMV, and WMV and greater FLV in comparison to PwMS that had normal VEP latency in one or both eyes. The findings suggest that PwMS that have delayed latency in both eyes may be particularly at risk for exhibiting greater brain atrophy and lesion volume. These analyses also indicate that VEP latency may index combined gray matter and white matter disturbances, and therefore broader network connectivity and efficiency.

MS is a heterogeneous demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with varying presentation, disease courses, and prognosis. Immunomodulatory therapies reduce the frequency and severity of inflammatory demyelinating events that are a hallmark of MS, but there is minimal therapy to treat progressive disease and there is no cure. Data from patients with MS, post-mortem histological analysis, and animal models of demyelinating disease have elucidated patterns of MS pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration. MRI and molecular biomarkers have been proposed to identify predictors of neurodegeneration and risk factors for disease progression. Early signs of axonal dysfunction have come to light including impaired mitochondrial trafficking, structural axonal changes, and synaptic alterations. With sustained inflammation as well as impaired remyelination, axons succumb to degeneration contributing to CNS atrophy and worsening of disease. These studies highlight the role of chronic demyelination in the CNS in perpetuating axonal loss, and the difficulty in promoting remyelination and repair amidst persistent inflammatory insult. Regenerative and neuroprotective strategies are essential to overcome this barrier, with early intervention being critical to rescue axonal integrity and function.

Approaches based solely on clinical measures are challenged by heterogeneity of phenotype and pathogenic complexity. Neurofilament light chain protein has been explored as a reliable biomarker in several neurodegenerative disorders but data on multiple system atrophy have been limited. Therefore, neurofilament light chain is not yet routinely used as an outcome measure in multiple system atrophy. We aimed to comprehensively investigate the role and dynamics of neurofilament light chain in multiple system atrophy combined with cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical and imaging scales and for subject trial selection. In this cohort study, we recruited cross-sectional and longitudinal cases in a multicentre European set-up. Plasma and CSF neurofilament light chain concentrations were measured at baseline from 212 multiple system atrophy cases, annually for a mean period of 2 years in 44 multiple system atrophy patients in conjunction with clinical, neuropsychological and MRI brain assessments. Baseline neurofilament light chain characteristics were compared between groups. Cox regression was used to assess survival; receiver operating characteristic analysis to assess the ability of neurofilament light chain to distinguish between multiple system atrophy patients and healthy controls. Multivariate linear mixed-effects models were used to analyse longitudinal neurofilament light chain changes and correlated with clinical and imaging parameters. Polynomial models were used to determine the differential trajectories of neurofilament light chain in multiple system atrophy. We estimated sample sizes for trials aiming to decrease neurofilament light chain levels. We show that in multiple system atrophy, baseline plasma neurofilament light chain levels were better predictors of clinical progression, survival and degree of brain atrophy than the neurofilament light chain rate of change. Comparative analysis of multiple system atrophy progression over the course of disease, using plasma neurofilament light chain and clinical rating scales, indicated that neurofilament light chain levels rise as the motor symptoms progress, followed by deceleration in advanced stages. Sample size prediction suggested that significantly lower trial participant numbers would be needed to demonstrate treatment effects when incorporating plasma neurofilament light chain values into multiple system atrophy clinical trials in comparison to clinical measures alone. In conclusion, neurofilament light chain correlates with clinical disease severity, progression and prognosis in multiple system atrophy. Combined with clinical and imaging analysis, neurofilament light chain can inform patient stratification and serve as a reliable biomarker of treatment response in future multiple system atrophy trials of putative disease-modifying agents.","2022",,"Brain"," We aimed to comprehensively investigate the role and dynamics of neurofilament light chain in multiple system atrophy combined with cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical and imaging scales and for subject trial selection ","other","Humans, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, TRUE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Intermediate Filaments, FALSE, Neurofilament Proteins, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The longitudinal effect of VC in people with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is unclear. This study explored the impact of VC on standard clinical, MRI, and visual outcomes in people with SPMS enrolled in a clinical trial.
METHODS: Data were extracted from a 2-year randomized controlled trial (N = 51) testing the supplement lipoic acid in people with SPMS who underwent annual Expanded Disability Status Scales, Timed 25-Foot Walk tests, MRIs, visual acuity testing, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses per optical coherence tomography (OCT). Post hoc linear mixed-effects regression analysis compared baseline and annualized outcomes between participants without VC (VC-) and with 1 or more VCs (VC+) (hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes, peripheral or cardiovascular disease, tobacco use).
RESULTS: The VC- (n = 19) and VC+ (n = 28) participants were similar in age, sex, and MS disease duration and had comparable MS disability, mobility, and brain atrophy at baseline and throughout the 2-year parent study. The VC+ participants had worse baseline visual acuity than those in the VC- group by 0.13 logMAR (
CONCLUSIONS: In an SPMS cohort, VC had an inconsistent effect on standard clinical, MRI, and exploratory OCT outcomes, suggesting that the effect of VC may not be evident in smaller cohort studies.

In this study, the Neuromuscular disease Swallowing Status Scale (NdSSS), which was developed to evaluate dysphagia in patients with neuromuscular diseases, was used to evaluate patients with MSA. In addition, correlation between a history of pneumonia and swallowing function was evaluated.
METHODS: Study 1: Reliability, concurrent validity, and responsiveness of the NdSSS in patients with MSA. In 81 patients for whom evaluation items could be collected, the NdSSS was tested for its interrater and intrarater reliability using weighted kappa statistics. Concurrent validity was assessed by correlating the NdSSS with existing scales (Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Functional Intake LEVEL Scale (FILS), and the unified MSA rating scale (UMSARS)) using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Sixty-three patients were evaluated by videofluorographic (VF) swallowing examination. To evaluate concurrent validity, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the NdSSS and VF swallowing assessments. Additionally, scale responsiveness was determined using the standardized response mean (SRM) in 23 patients who could be followed up to assess their long-term course. Study 2: Cross-sectional survey of swallowing function and history of pneumonia. Data regarding history of pneumonia, UMSARS, NdSSS, age, sex, MSA subtype, and disease duration were retrospectively obtained from the medical records of 113 patients with MSA. Differences in these parameters and NdSSS stage between those with and without a history of pneumonia were examined using the Mann-Whitney test or chi-squared test. Furthermore, clinical factors related to a history of pneumonia were examined by binomial logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The NdSSS showed satisfactory reliability, concurrent validity, and responsiveness. A history of pneumonia was related to the severity of MSA, age, MSA subtype, and NdSSS stage. Binomial logistic regression analysis showed that NdSSS stage (odds ratio (OR), 0.490; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.301-0.797, 
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MSA, the NdSSS has sufficient reliability, concurrent validity, and responsiveness for assessing dysphagia. Patients with a history of pneumonia have more severe dysphagia. We found that the pneumonia risk was related to NdSSS stage and MSA-p (predominantly parkinsonism).

Here we report a North-Bavarian (colloquially, Lion's tail region) six-generation pedigree, including neuropathologically confirmed multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease with dementia. Between 2012 and 2020, we examined all living and consenting family members of age and calculated the risk of prodromal Parkinson's disease in those without overt parkinsonism. The index case and one paternal cousin with Parkinson's disease with dementia died at follow-up and underwent neuropathological examination. Genetic analysis was performed in both and another family member with Parkinson's disease. The index case was a female patient with cerebellar variant multiple system atrophy and a positive maternal and paternal family history for Parkinson's disease and dementia in multiple generations. The families of the index case and her spouse were genealogically related, and one of the spouse's siblings met the criteria for possible prodromal Parkinson's disease. Neuropathological examination confirmed multiple system atrophy in the index case and advanced Lewy body disease, as well as tau pathology in her cousin. A comprehensive analysis of genes known to cause hereditary forms of parkinsonism or multiple system atrophy lookalikes was unremarkable in the index case and the other two affected family members. Here, we report an extensive European pedigree with multiple system atrophy and Parkinson`s disease suggesting a complex underlying α-synucleinopathy as confirmed on neuropathological examination.

METHODS: We genotyped the HTT gene CAG repeat number and APOE-Ɛ isoforms in a case-control series including patients with either clinical or neuropathological diagnosis of α-synucleinopathy.
RESULTS: We identified three Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (0.30%) and two healthy controls (0.19%) carrying low-penetrance HTT repeat expansions whereas none of the dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or multisystem atrophy (MSA) patients carried pathogenic HTT expansions. In addition, a clear increase in the number of HTT CAG repeats was found among DLB and PD groups influenced by the male gender and also by the APOE4 allele among DLB patients. HTT intermediate alleles' (IAs) distribution frequency increased in the MSA group compared with controls (8.8% vs. 3.9%, respectively).

Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (eg, counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.","2022",,"Lancet Neurol",," review","Antihypertensive Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Blood Pressure, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hypertension, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Hypotension, Orthostatic, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Syncope, FALSE, complications, Q000150",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

We aimed to compare initial symptoms, disease progression, and clinical features at final evaluation and investigate differences in survival and natural history between patients with MSA with motor and nonmotor presentations.
METHODS: Medical records of autopsy-confirmed MSA cases at Queen Square Brain Bank who underwent both clinical examination and cardiovascular autonomic testing were identified. Clinical features, age at onset, sex, time from onset to diagnosis, disease duration, autonomic function tests, and plasma noradrenaline levels were evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with autopsy-confirmed MSA (age 60 ± 8 years; 28 men) were identified. Time from symptom onset to first autonomic evaluation was 4 ± 2 years, and the disease duration was 7.7 ± 2.2 years. Fifteen (32%) patients presented with nonmotor features including genitourinary dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, or REM sleep behavior disorder before developing motor involvement (median delay 1-6 years). A third (5/15) were initially diagnosed with pure autonomic failure (PAF) before evolving into MSA. All these patients had normal supine plasma noradrenaline levels (332.0 ± 120.3 pg/mL) with no rise on head-up tilt (0.1 ± 0.3 pg/mL). Patients with MSA with early cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (within 3 years of symptom onset) had shorter survival compared with those with later onset of cardiovascular autonomic impairment (6.8 years [5.6-7.9] vs 8.5 years [7.9-9.2]; 
DISCUSSION: Almost one-third of patients with MSA presented with nonmotor features, which could predate motor symptoms by up to 6 years.

Then we calculated Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) for PD, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, Lewy body dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. These GRSs were regressed against the probability of belonging to a subtype in the two independent cohorts and we calculated q-values as an adjustment for multiple testing across four subtypes. We also carried out a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of belonging to a subtype.
RESULTS: A severe disease subtype had the highest rates of patients carrying GBA mutations while the mild disease subtype had the lowest rates (p=0.009). Using the GRS, we found a severe disease subtype had a reduced genetic risk of PD (p=0.004 and q=0.015).

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to develop a novel disease-progression model to estimate a population-level MSA progression trajectory and predict patient-specific continuous disease stages describing the degree of progress into the disease.
METHODS: The disease-progression model estimated a population-level progression trajectory of subscales of the Unified MSA Rating Scale and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale using patients in the European MSA natural history study. The predicted disease continuum was validated via multiple analyses based on reported anchor points, and the effect of MSA subtype on the rate of disease progression was evaluated.
RESULTS: The predicted disease continuum spanned approximately 6 years, with an estimated average duration of 51 months for a patient with global disability score 0 to reach the highest level of 4. The predicted continuous disease stages were shown to be correlated with time of symptom onset and predictive of survival time. MSA motor subtype was found to significantly affect disease progression, with MSA-parkinsonian (MSA-P) type patients having an accelerated rate of progression.

METHODS: We examined 40 autopsy-confirmed MSA cases in New York Brain Bank. The pyramidal signs were quantified by an established rating scale, summarized as the pyramidal score. We assessed whether pyramidal scores are associated with autonomic, parkinsonism, and cerebellar features and survival. We also examined whether the density of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in the motor cortex and its underlying white matter is associated with the pyramidal score.
RESULTS: MSA parkinsonian type cases have higher pyramidal scores compared to cerebellar type cases (p = 0.017). MSA cases with high pyramidal scores are more likely to have laryngeal stridor (OR = 4.89, p = 0.022), but less likely to have orthostatic hypotension (OR = 0.11, p = 0.006) and erectile dysfunction (OR = 0.05, p = 0.018).

It induces parkinsonian and/or cerebellar syndrome associated with dysautonomia. Pharyngolaryngeal symptoms are common. Our aim is to describe the Pharyngolaryngeal semiology on one hand, and to ascertain whether the presence of these symptoms represents a prognostic factor for MSA on the other.
METHODS: Thus, we carried out a retrospective, single-centre study, on a cohort receiving care at the centre of reference for MSA. The patients were referred for otorhinolaryngology assessment. The data was collected over the year 2020 with the help of computer software from the university hospital centre (UHC). Firstly, we described the Pharyngolaryngeal semiology specific to MSA by questioning patients, and by the results of nasofibroscopic examinations and swallowing tests. We then used multivariate analysis of variance to describe the prognostic factors of MSA progression (in UMSARS I and II points per month of progression) and survival (number of years between the first symptoms and death).
RESULTS: This study included a hundred and one patients and made it possible to define a Pharyngolaryngeal semiology profile of MSA, which is: a reduction in laryngeal mobility (primarily vocal cord abduction defects), abnormal movements (particularly at rest or when initiating a movement) and a defect in the protection mechanisms of the upper airways. The swallowing difficulties are moderate and the main mechanisms are delayed pharyngeal swallow and/or an oro-pharyngeal transport defect. In the multivariate analyses, the contributing factors are laryngeal anomalies, modification of solid food to fluid food and nutritional complication.

The prevalence of FOG symptoms in the MSA cohort was determined, and clinical manifestations in MSA patients with and without FOG were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 91 MSA patients, 60 (65.93%) exhibited FOG.

Exploration substantially increases pain and mental stress, and the costs and length of hospital stay are considerably increased. Identifying preoperative risk factors associated with unresectability could decrease unnecessary exploration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 440 HCCA patients from multiple centers were enrolled. Those receiving surgical exploration were divided into the resected and unresected groups. Morphological variables including Bismuth classification, lymph node metastasis and vessel invasion were obtained from radiological exams. Logistic regression for the training cohort was used to identify risk factors for unresectability, and a nomogram was constructed to calculate the unresectability rate. A calibration curve assessed the power of the nomogram.
RESULTS: Among 311 patients receiving surgical exploration, 45 (14.7%) were unresectable by intraoperative judgment. Compared with the resected group, unresected patients had similar costs (p = 0.359) and lengths of hospital stay (p = 0.439). Multivariable logistic regression of the training cohort (235 patients) revealed that CA125, Bismuth-Corlette type IV, lymph node metastasis and hepatic artery invasion were risk factors for unresectability. Liver atrophy (p = 0.374) and portal vein invasion (p = 0.114) were not risk factors. The nomogram was constructed based on the risk factors. The concordance index (C-index) values of the calibration curve for predicting the unresectability rate of the training and validation (76 patients) cohorts were 0.900 (95% CI, 0.835-0.966) and 0.829 (95% CI, 0.546-0.902), respectively.

,"35400321","Exploring the Recent Trends in Management of Dementia and Frailty: Focus on Diagnosis and Treatment.","Rahman MM","Dementia and frailty increase health adversities in older adults, which are topics of growing research interest. Frailty is considered to correspond to a biological syndrome associated with age. Frail patients may ultimately develop multiple dysfunctions across several systems, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, cortico-basal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Patients with dementia and frailty often develop malnutrition and weight loss. Rigorous nutritional, pharmacological, and non-pharmacological interventions generally are required for these patients, which is a challenging issue for healthcare providers. A healthy diet and lifestyle instigated at an early age can reduce the risk of frailty and dementia. For optimal treatment, accurate diagnosis involving clinical evaluation, cognitive screening, essential laboratory evaluation, structural imaging, functional neuroimaging, and neuropsychological testing is necessary. Diagnosis procedures best apply the clinical diagnosis, identifying the cause(s) and the condition(s) appropriate for treatment. The patient's history, caregiver's interview, physical examination, cognitive evaluation, laboratory tests, and structural imaging should best be involved in the diagnostic process. Varying types of physical exercise can aid the treatment of these disorders. Nutrition maintenance is a particularly significant factor, such as exceptionally high-calorie dietary supplements and a Mediterranean diet to support weight gain. The core purpose of this article is to investigate trends in the management of dementia and frailty, focusing on improving diagnosis and treatment. Substantial evidence builds the consensus that a combination of balanced nutrition and good physical activity is an integral part of treatment.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of stridor treatment in an MSA cohort.
METHODS: This is a retrospective and prospective monocentric cohort study including MSA patients evaluated at least once a year during the disease course. Stridor was video-polysomnography confirmed. The time of stridor treatment (CPAP or tracheostomy) and latency from stridor onset were collected. Survival and predictors of survival were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 182 (107 males, mean age at disease onset 57.3 ± 8.4 years) MSA patients were included in the study; 141 were deceased at the time of study. Of the total sample, 75 patients were diagnosed with stridor: 22 patients were treated with tracheostomy and 29 with CPAP, whilst 24 patients did not receive treatment. Treatment with tracheostomy showed longer survival compared with both treatment with CPAP or no treatment (incidence rate of death 12 vs. 21 vs. 23 per 100 person-years, respectively). Tracheostomy remained an independent factor associated with longer survival (hazard ratio 0.38, p = 0.029), also after adjustment for other confounders and latency for stridor treatment.

The literature on the pathophysiology of dementia in HipFx patients is scarce. We performed a differential diagnosis of dementia in HipFx patients using clinical and brain MRI findings.
METHODS: This is a prospective study in which brain MRI was evaluated for patients with HipFx for research purposes. One-hundred-and-five HipFx patients (85 females and 20 males) who underwent surgery and were subsequently able to undergo brain MRI at our hospital were evaluated. The mean age was 84 years. The presence of dementia was determined based on clinical findings and whether the patient meets its diagnostic criteria according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Edition (ICD-10). The differential diagnosis of dementia was made based on brain MRI findings and the dementia diagnostic flow chart published in the Clinical Practice Guideline for Dementia 2017 (Japanese Society of Neurology). The Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer's Disease (VSRAD) advance 2 diagnostic software was used to evaluate atrophy of the para-hippocampal gyrus.
RESULTS: Fifty-six (53%) patients were clinically diagnosed with dementia according to the ICD-10 criteria. The MRI findings were diverse: Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type, asymptomatic multiple ischemic cerebral lesions, past symptomatic cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage, Binswanger's disease (BW)-type, chronic subdural hematoma, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoidal hydrocephalus (DESH), and their combinations thereof. A combination of MRI and clinical findings of dementia patients demonstrated the following distribution of dementia subtypes: AD (n = 20), vascular dementia (n = 33), AD and BW vascular dementia (n = 3).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the brain MRI findings of HipFx patients were diverse. Although vascular dementia is found to be common in this particular population, this could be an incidental finding. Further study is warranted to clarify the specificity of our findings by increasing the number of patients, setting the control, and investigating whether dementia subtypes affect postoperative gait acquisition and fall risk.","2022",,"PLoS One"," This is a prospective study in which brain MRI was evaluated for patients with HipFx for research purposes ","other","Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, pathology, Q000473, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Dementia, Vascular, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Hip Fractures, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neuroimaging, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Clinical and pathological characteristics of such later onset MSA (LO-MSA) compared to usual onset MSA (UO-MSA) remain poorly understood.
METHODS: The clinical cohort included patients from Kobe University Hospital and Amagasaki General Medical Center Hospital, while the autopsy cohort was from the brain bank at Mayo Clinic Florida. We identified 83 patients in the clinical cohort and 193 patients in the autopsy cohort. We divided MSA into two groups according to age at onset: UO-MSA (≤ 75) and LO-MSA (> 75). We compared clinical features and outcomes between the two groups in the clinical cohort and compared the findings to the autopsy cohort.
RESULTS: LO-MSA accounted for 8% in the clinical cohort and 5% in the autopsy cohort. The median time from onset to death or to life-saving tracheostomy was significantly shorter in LO-MSA than in UO-MSA in both cohorts (4.8 vs 7.9 years in the clinical cohort and 3.9 vs 7.5 years in the autopsy cohort; P = 0.043 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The median time from diagnosis to death was less than 3 years in LO-MSA in the clinical cohort.

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an established neurosurgical option for advanced Parkinson disease (PD). Although DBS effectiveness in PD fed expectations for the treatment of APs, DBS is still not recommended for APs on the basis of expert consensus and lack of clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we sought to analyze current evidence on the safety and efficacy of DBS in APs, discussing clinical indications, anatomical targets, and ethical issues.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed for studies reporting the outcome of patients with APs treated with DBS.
RESULTS: We identified 25 eligible studies for a total of 66 patients with APs treated with DBS: 31 PSP, 22 MSA, 12 DLB, 1 unspecified parkinsonism with tongue tremor. Targeted nuclei were subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus pars-interna (GPi), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), and nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). Only 3/25 studies were randomized controlled trials, and most studies showed a high risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: Taking into account study biases and confounding factors, current evidence does not support the use of DBS in APs. However, some interesting insights arise from the literature, such as the high frequency of cognitive/neurobehavioral issues in MSA patients treated with STN-DBS, the low frequency of complications in trials of nbM-DBS for DLB, and the possible good response of dystonic symptoms in PSP with GPi DBS.","2022",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord"," OBJECTIVE : In this systematic review , we sought to analyze current evidence on the safety and efficacy of DBS in APs , discussing clinical indications , anatomical targets , and ethical issues ","systematic review","Basal Nucleus of Meynert, FALSE, Deep Brain Stimulation, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009, Globus Pallidus, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Subthalamic Nucleus, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Joint models allow to study their evolution by taking into account the possible informative dropout usually due to clinical events. However, joint modeling developments mostly focused on continuous Gaussian markers while, in an increasing number of studies, the actual quantity of interest is non-directly measurable; it constitutes a latent variable evaluated by a set of observed indicators from questionnaires or measurement scales. Classical examples include anxiety, fatigue, cognition. In this work, we explain how joint models can be extended to the framework of a latent quantity measured over time by indicators of different nature (e.g. continuous, binary, ordinal). The longitudinal submodel describes the evolution over time of the quantity of interest defined as a latent process in a structural mixed model, and links the latent process to each observation of the indicators through appropriate measurement models. Simultaneously, the risk of multi-cause event is modelled via a proportional cause-specific hazard model that includes a function of the mixed model elements as linear predictor to take into account the association between the latent process and the risk of event. Estimation, carried out in the maximum likelihood framework and implemented in the R-package JLPM, has been validated by simulations.

Unraveling such heterogeneity might aid in elucidating etiological mechanisms and support precision and individualized medicine.
OBJECTIVE: To cross-sectionally and longitudinally delineate disease-related heterogeneity in LLD associated with neuroanatomy, cognitive functioning, clinical symptoms, and genetic profiles.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Imaging-Based Coordinate System for Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases (iSTAGING) study is an international multicenter consortium investigating brain aging in pooled and harmonized data from 13 studies with more than 35 000 participants, including a subset of individuals with major depressive disorder. Multimodal data from a multicenter sample (N = 996), including neuroimaging, neurocognitive assessments, and genetics, were analyzed in this study. A semisupervised clustering method (heterogeneity through discriminative analysis) was applied to regional gray matter (GM) brain volumes to derive dimensional representations. Data were collected from July 2017 to July 2020 and analyzed from July 2020 to December 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two dimensions were identified to delineate LLD-associated heterogeneity in voxelwise GM maps, white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy, neurocognitive functioning, clinical phenotype, and genetics.
RESULTS: A total of 501 participants with LLD (mean [SD] age, 67.39 [5.56] years; 332 women) and 495 healthy control individuals (mean [SD] age, 66.53 [5.16] years; 333 women) were included. Patients in dimension 1 demonstrated relatively preserved brain anatomy without WM disruptions relative to healthy control individuals. In contrast, patients in dimension 2 showed widespread brain atrophy and WM integrity disruptions, along with cognitive impairment and higher depression severity. Moreover, 1 de novo independent genetic variant (rs13120336; chromosome: 4, 186387714; minor allele, G) was significantly associated with dimension 1 (odds ratio, 2.35; SE, 0.15; P = 3.14 ×108) but not with dimension 2. The 2 dimensions demonstrated significant single-nucleotide variant-based heritability of 18% to 27% within the general population (N = 12 518 in UK Biobank). In a subset of individuals having longitudinal measurements, those in dimension 2 experienced a more rapid longitudinal change in GM and brain age (Cohen f2 = 0.03; P = .02) and were more likely to progress to Alzheimer disease (Cohen f2 = 0.03; P = .03) compared with those in dimension 1 (N = 1431 participants and 7224 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [BLSA], and Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Dementia [BIOCARD] data sets).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study characterized heterogeneity in LLD into 2 dimensions with distinct neuroanatomical, cognitive, clinical, and genetic profiles.

Although the literature on the neurological consequences of electric shocks is limited by retrospective designs, case studies and studies of selected patient groups, previous research provides some evidence of a link between electric shocks, and diseases and symptoms of the central nervous system (CNS)(e.g. epilepsy, migraine and vertigo) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS)(e.g. loss of sensation, neuropathy and muscle weakness). This study aims to employ a register-based, matched cohort study, to investigate whether individuals demonstrate a greater risk of neurological diseases and symptoms of the CNS or PNS in the years following an electrical injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 14,112 electrical injuries over a period of 19 years in two Danish registries, and matched these with three different groups of persons in a prospective matched cohort study: (1) patients with dislocation/sprain injuries, (2) patients with eye injuries and (3) persons employed in the same occupation. Year of injury, sex and age were used as matching variables. The outcomes we identified comprised neurological disorders and central or peripheral nervous system symptoms that covered a range of diagnoses in the Danish National Patient Register. The associations were analysed using conditional logistic regression for a range of time periods (six months to five years) and conditional Cox regression for analyses of the complete follow-up period (up to 20 years).
RESULTS: For victims of electric shock, the CNS sequelae we identified included an increased risk of epilepsy, convulsions, abnormal involuntary movements, headache, migraine and vertigo. We also identified an uncertain, increased risk of spinal muscular atrophy and dystonia, whereas we identified no increased risk of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, multiple sclerosis or other degenerative diseases of the nervous system. For victims of electric shock, the PNS sequelae we identified included an increased risk of disturbances of skin sensation, mononeuropathy in the arm or leg and nerve root and plexus disorders. We also identified an uncertain, increased risk of facial nerve disorders, other mononeuropathy, and polyneuropathy.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that electrical injuries increase the risk of several neurological diseases and symptoms of the CNS or PNS in the years following the injury. Most often the diseases and symptoms are diagnosed within the first six months of the injury, but delayed onset of up to 5 years cannot be ruled out for some symptoms and diagnoses. Some of the conditions were rare in our population, which limited our ability to identify associations, and this warrants cautious interpretation. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm our findings, as are studies that examine the mechanisms underlying these associations.","2022",,"PLoS One"," This study aims to employ a register-based , matched cohort study , to investigate whether individuals demonstrate a greater risk of neurological diseases and symptoms of the CNS or PNS in the years following an electrical injury ","other","Cohort Studies, FALSE, Electric Injuries, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Humans, FALSE, Nervous System Diseases, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Vertigo, FALSE, complications, Q000150",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

In aging sarcopenia is due to mild chronic inflammation but also to fiber-intrinsic defects, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. Age-related sarcopenia is associated with physical disability and lowered quality of life. In addition to skeletal muscle, the nervous tissue is also affected in elderly people. With aging, type 2 fast fibers preferentially undergo denervation and are reinnervated by slow-twitch motor neurons. They spread forming new neuro-muscular junctions with the denervated fibers: the result is an increased proportion of slow fibers that group together since they are associated in the same motor unit. Grouping and fiber type shifting are indeed major histological features of aging skeletal muscle. Exercise has been proposed as an intervention for age-related sarcopenia due to its numerous beneficial effects on muscle mechanical and biochemical features. In 2013, a precursor study in humans was published in the European Journal of Translation Myology (formerly known as Basic and Applied Myology), highlighting the occurrence of reinnervation in the musculature of aged, exercise-trained individuals as compared to the matching control. This paper, entitled «Reinnervation of Vastus lateralis is increased significantly in seniors (70-years old) with a lifelong history of high-level exercise», is now being reprinted for the second issue of the «Ejtm Seminal Paper Series».

Increasing evidence suggests a crucial role of the lysosome in neurodegeneration as a key regulator of aggregation-prone and disease-associated proteins, such as α-synuclein, β-amyloid and huntingtin. Particularly, alterations in lysosomal cathepsins CTSD, CTSB and CTSL can contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases as seen for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, Dementia with Lewy Body and Multiple System Atrophy) as well as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.

We describe a deep learning (DL) approach which achieves multi-class detection of non-AMD vs. non-neovascular (NNV) AMD vs. NV AMD from a combination of OCTA, OCT structure, 2D b-scan flow images, and high definition (HD) 5-line b-scan cubes; DL also detects ocular biomarkers indicative of AMD risk. Multimodal data were used as input to 2D-3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Both for CNNs and experts, choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy were found to be important biomarkers for AMD. CNNs predict biomarkers with accuracy up to 90.2% (positive-predictive-value up to 75.8%). Just as experts rely on multimodal data to diagnose AMD, CNNs also performed best when trained on multiple inputs combined. Detection of AMD and its biomarkers from OCTA data via CNNs has tremendous potential to expedite screening of early and late-stage AMD patients.","2022",,"Sci Rep",,"comparative study","Biomarkers, FALSE, Choroidal Neovascularization, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Deep Learning, FALSE, Diagnosis, Differential, FALSE, Expert Testimony, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Macular Degeneration, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Neural Networks, Computer, TRUE, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, ROC Curve, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Severity of Illness Index, FALSE, Tomography, Optical Coherence, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, few reports have addressed TIV in multiple system atrophy (MSA). This study sought to evaluate the impact of TIV on survival in MSA patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined medical records of probable or definite MSA for patients in Hyogo-Chuo National Hospital from January 2000 to September 2021 to investigate overall survival and cause of death in those with tracheostomy and TIV.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 12 definite and 127 probable MSA patients. Mean age at onset was 61.3 ± 9.8 years, and median survival time was 9.0 years. Tracheostomy was performed in 53 patients, 21 of whom were ventilated. Mean time from onset to tracheostomy and TIV was 7.0 ± 3.0 and 8.4 ± 4.4 years, respectively. After propensity score matching, tracheostomy showed a significant prolongation of median survival compared with no tracheostomy (10.1 vs. 7.5 years, p = 0.001) and TIV significantly prolonged survival compared with tracheostomy alone (17.8 vs. 9.2 years, p = 0.023). On Cox regression analysis, the hazard ratio for tracheostomy was 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.68, p = 0.002) and TIV was 0.22 (95% CI 0.07-0.89, p = 0.032).

During spaceflight, astronauts are subjected to several hazards including a prolonged state of microgravity that induces a myriad of physiological adaptations leading to orthostatic intolerance. This review summarises all known cardiovascular diseases related to human spaceflight and focusses on the cardiovascular changes related to human spaceflight (in vivo) as well as cellular and molecular changes (in vitro). Upon entering microgravity, cephalad fluid shift occurs and increases the stroke volume (35-46%) and cardiac output (18-41%). Despite this increase, astronauts enter a state of hypovolemia (10-15% decrease in blood volume). The absence of orthostatic pressure and a decrease in arterial pressures reduces the workload of the heart and is believed to be the underlying mechanism for the development of cardiac atrophy in space. Cellular and molecular changes include altered cell shape and endothelial dysfunction through suppressed cellular proliferation as well as increased cell apoptosis and oxidative stress. Human spaceflight is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Through the use of microgravity platforms, multiple physiological changes can be studied and stimulate the development of appropriate tools and countermeasures for future human spaceflight missions in low Earth orbit and beyond.","2021",,"Biomedicines",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Multiple susceptibility loci have been reported to have an increased risk for AD and the morphology of brain structures are affected by the variations in the risk loci. Therefore, we hypothesized that genes contributed significantly to the ventricular surface, and the changes of ventricular surface were associated with the impairment of cognitive functions. After the quality controls (QC) and genotyping, a lateral ventricular segmentation method was employed to obtain the surface features of lateral ventricle. We evaluated the influence of 18 selected AD susceptibility loci on both volume and surface morphology across 410 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Correlations were conducted between radial distance (RD) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) subscales. Only the C allele at the rs744373 loci in BIN1 gene significantly accelerated the atrophy of lateral ventricle, including the anterior horn, body, and temporal horn of left lateral ventricle. No significant effect on lateral ventricle was found at other loci. Our results revealed that most regions of the bilateral ventricular surface were significantly negatively correlated with cognitive scores, particularly in delayed recall. Besides, small areas of surface were negatively correlated with language, orientation, and visuospatial scores. Together, our results indicated that the genetic variation affected the localized areas of lateral ventricular surface, and supported that lateral ventricle was an important brain structure associated with cognition in the elderly.","2022",,"Brain Struct Funct",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Brain, FALSE, Cognitive Dysfunction, TRUE, Disease Susceptibility, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Neuroimaging, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

This study was aimed at investigating possible associations between mortality, 24-h blood pressure (BP) level and variability, and drug treatments for orthostatic hypotension (OH) in MSA patients.
METHODS: A total of 129 patients followed at the French Reference Center for MSA who underwent routine 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring were included. Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) scores, drug treatments and the occurrence and cause of death were recorded.
RESULTS: Seventy patients died during follow-up (2.9 ± 1.8 years), mainly from terminal illness, pulmonary or sudden death. Multivariate Cox regression analysis, after adjustment for gender, disease duration and severity (UMSARS I+II score), showed that increased daytime systolic BP variability, OH severity and OH drug treatment were independently correlated with mortality. OH treatment was associated with the risk of cardiac causes and/or sudden death (p = 0.01). In a fully adjusted model, male gender [(female vs. male) hazard ratio (HR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.94, p = 0.03], UMSARS I+II score (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06, p < 0.01), systolic BP daytime variability (HR 3.66, 95% CI 1.46-9.17, p < 0.01) and OH treatment (HR: 2.13, 95% CI 1.15-3.94, p = 0.02) predicted mortality.

A detailed evaluation of its major endoscopic features compared with Parkinson's disease (PD) is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: This study systematically assessed dysphagia in MSA compared with PD and correlated subjective dysphagia to objective endoscopic findings.
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with MSA (median, 64 [interquartile range (IQR): 59-71] years; 35 women) underwent flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing using a specific MSA-flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing task protocol. Findings were compared with an age-matched cohort of 57 patients with PD (median, 67 [interquartile range: 60-73] years; 28 women). In a subcohort, subjective dysphagia was assessed using the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire and correlated to endoscopy findings.
RESULTS: Patients with MSA predominantly showed symptoms suggestive of oral-phase disturbance (premature spillage, 75.4%, piecemeal deglutition, 75.4%). Pharyngeal-phase symptoms occurred less often (pharyngeal residues, 50.9%; penetration/aspiration, 28.1%). In contrast, pharyngeal symptoms were the most common finding in PD (pharyngeal residues, 47.4%). Oral symptoms occurred less frequently in PD (premature spillage, 15.8%, P < 0.001; piecemeal deglutition, 1.8%, P < 0.01). Patients with MSA had a greater risk for oral-phase disturbances with increased disease severity (P < 0.05; odds ratio, 3.15). Patients with MSA showed a significantly higher intraindividual interswallow variability compared with PD. When correlating Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire scores with endoscopy results, its cutoff, validated for PD, was not sensitive enough to identify patients with MSA with dysphagia. We developed a subscore for identifying dysphagia in MSA and calculated a new cutoff (sensitivity 85%, specificity 100%).
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with patients with PD, patients with dysphagic MSA more frequently present with oral-phase symptoms and a significantly higher intraindividual interswallow variability.

The present study demonstrates widespread biodistribution of vector genomes and transgenes throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs, after intravenous administration of an AAV9-mediated gene therapy. Two symptomatic infants with SMA1 enrolled in phase III studies received onasemnogene abeparvovec. Both patients died of respiratory complications unrelated to onasemnogene abeparvovec. One patient had improved motor function and the other died shortly after administration before appreciable clinical benefit could be observed. In both patients, onasemnogene abeparvovec DNA and messenger RNA distribution were widespread among peripheral organs and in the CNS. The greatest concentration of vector genomes was detected in the liver, with an increase over that detected in CNS tissues of 300-1,000-fold. SMN protein, which was low in an untreated SMA1 control, was clearly detectable in motor neurons, brain, skeletal muscle and multiple peripheral organs in treated patients.

The objective of this study was to determine changes in hospital admissions for neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany; (2) Methods: This cross-sectional study used nationwide administrative claims data covering 1468 hospitals. The primary outcome was the year-to-year relative change in case numbers during a four-month study period (16 January-15 May 2020 vs. 2019) during the first pandemic wave. Secondary outcomes included year-to-year relative changes during a four-week peak phase (16 March-15 April) and changes between differential phases of the wave. The analyzed NDD comprised progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease; (3) Results: Hospital admissions for any reason decreased by 16.7% in 2020 during the study period and by 36.6% during the peak phase, whereas admissions for NDD decreased by 27.6% and 65.0%, respectively. PSP cases decreased during the study period (-34.7%) and the peak phase (-68.1%) and stayed reduced in a late phase with falling COVID-19 numbers. MSA and ALS cases increased strongest after the peak, with ALS cases being comparatively weakly reduced during the study period (-17.3%) and peak phase (-51.7%); (4) Conclusions: Inpatient care utilization for NDD changed differentially during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and showed a greater reduction than overall and general neurological admissions.

There is compelling evidence suggesting that biological trace metals like iron and copper play an important role in synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease and removing excess brain iron using chelators could slow down the disease progression. In human MSA, there is evidence of increased iron in affected brain regions, but role of iron and therapeutic efficacy of iron-lowering drugs in pre-clinical models of MSA have not been studied. We studied age-related changes in iron metabolism in different brain regions of the PLP-αsyn mice and tested whether iron-lowering drugs could alleviate disease phenotype in aged PLP-αsyn mice. Iron content, iron-ferritin association, ferritin protein levels and copper-ceruloplasmin association were measured in prefrontal cortex, putamen, substantia nigra and cerebellum of 3, 8, and 20-month-old PLP-αsyn and age-matched non-transgenic mice. Moreover, 12-month-old PLP-αsyn mice were administered deferiprone or ceruloplasmin or vehicle for 2 months. At the end of treatment period, motor testing and stereological analyses were performed. We found iron accumulation and perturbed iron-ferritin interaction in substantia nigra, putamen and cerebellum of aged PLP-αsyn mice. Furthermore, we found significant reduction in ceruloplasmin-bound copper in substantia nigra and cerebellum of the PLP-αsyn mice. Both deferiprone and ceruloplasmin prevented decline in motor performance in aged PLP-αsyn mice and were associated with higher neuronal survival and reduced density of α-synuclein aggregates in substantia nigra. This is the first study to report brain iron accumulation in a mouse model of MSA. Our results indicate that elevated iron in MSA mice may result from ceruloplasmin dysfunction and provide evidence that targeting iron in MSA could be a viable therapeutic option.","2021",,"Neurobiol Dis"," We studied age-related changes in iron metabolism in different brain regions of the PLP-αsyn mice and tested whether iron-lowering drugs could alleviate disease phenotype in aged PLP-αsyn mice ","other","Animals, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cerebellum, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Ceruloplasmin, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Copper, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Deferiprone, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Ferritins, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Iron, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Iron Chelating Agents, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Transgenic, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Prefrontal Cortex, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Putamen, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

In addition to the underlying neurodegenerative condition, patients often experience blood pressure dysregulation, such as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and/or supine hypertension. This commentary details the collaborative care between a cardiologist and neurologist to effectively manage medically complex patients with nOH by illustrating the case of a 76-year-old man with a history of multiple system atrophy who experienced recurrent syncope when standing or sitting and falls with loss of consciousness. The patient could walk only a few steps before experiencing a substantial drop in systolic blood pressure (100 mmHg). He also had features of profound parkinsonism (e.g., tremor, facial masking) that required treatment with levodopa, but orthostatic symptoms related to the blood pressure drop needed improvement first. The neurologist and cardiologist collaborated to diagnose nOH and initiate droxidopa treatment, which led to resolution of syncope, control of orthostatic symptoms, and improvement of orthostatic blood pressure. Considerations in the collaborative care of patients with nOH are outlined, including screening protocols, treatment goals and options, mitigation of supine hypertension risk (a condition that frequently coexists with nOH), and management of other comorbidities. In conclusion, collaboration between neurologists and cardiologists is an efficient method to improve outcomes for patients with nOH because this care model allows specialist providers to leverage their areas of expertise to manage the wide spectrum of clinical features associated with nOH. Further, communication and cooperation of the patient care team can lead to reduced patient morbidity, optimal relief of nOH symptoms, improvements in activities of daily living and quality of life, and decreased caregiver burden.

Therefore, therapies targeting aSyn aggregation and toxicity have been studied as a possible disease-modifying therapy for MSA. Our earlier studies show that inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) with KYP-2047 reduces aSyn aggregates in several models. Here, we tested the effects of KYP-2047 on a MSA cellular models, using rat OLN-AS7 and human MO3.13 oligodendrocyte cells. As translocation of p25α to cell cytosol has been identified as an inducer of aSyn aggregation in MSA models, the cells were transiently transfected with p25α. Similar to earlier studies, p25α increased aSyn phosphorylation and aggregation, and caused tubulin retraction and impaired autophagy in OLN-AS7 cells. In both cellular models, p25α transfection increased significantly aSyn mRNA levels and also increased the levels of inactive protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). However, aSyn or p25α did not cause any cellular death in MO3.13 cells, questioning their use as a MSA model.

Therefore, the aim was to investigate seizure prevalence and associated clinical implications in neuropathologically diagnosed ND.
METHODS: Clinical records of cases from the Neurobiobank Munich, Germany, were analyzed. Neuropathological diagnoses of the assessed cases included Alzheimer disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Lewy body disease (LBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Seizure prevalence during the whole symptomatic disease phase was assessed and compared amongst ND. Associations between first clinical symptom and seizure prevalence and between seizures and disease duration were examined.
RESULTS: In all, 454 patients with neuropathologically diagnosed ND and with available and meaningful clinical records were investigated (AD, n = 144; LBD, n = 103; PSP, n = 93; FTLD, n = 53; MSA, n = 36; CBD, n = 25). Seizure prevalence was 31.3% for AD, 20.0% for CBD, 12.6% for LBD, 11.3% for FTLD, 8.3% for MSA and 7.5% for PSP. Seizure prevalence was significantly higher in AD compared to FTLD (p = 0.005), LBD (p = 0.001), MSA (p = 0.005) and PSP (p < 0.001). No other significant differences regarding seizure prevalence were found between the studied ND. Cognitive first symptoms in ND were associated with an increased seizure prevalence (21.1% vs. 11.0% in patients without cognitive first symptoms) and motor first symptoms with a decreased seizure prevalence (10.3% vs. 20.5% in patients without motor first symptoms). Seizures were associated with a longer disease duration in MSA (12.3 vs. 7.0 years in patients without seizures; p = 0.017).

In order to assess the pathogenicity of these variants, expression experiments of RNA and protein for EXOSC8 were carried out.

This study aimed to determine fatigue prevalence and associated demographic, motor, and non-motor symptoms in MSA patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 174 MSA patients met ""Probable"" diagnostic criteria were included in this cross-sectional study. Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was used to measure fatigue prevalence. Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) were used for comprehensive clinical assessments. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney or Pearson's chi-square test was used to compare the patient score with or without fatigue (defined as a mean FSS score≥4). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine features independently associated with the presence of fatigue.
RESULTS: Fifty (28.7%) patients enrolled reported fatigue.

,"34126454","Neurosurgery and spinal adaptations in spaceflight: A literature review.","Lazzari ZT","BACKGROUND: Spaceflight places astronauts in multiple environments capable of inducing pathological changes. Alterations in the spine have a significant impact on astronauts' health during and after spaceflight. Low back pain is an established and common intra-flight complaint. Intervertebral disc herniation occurs at higher rates in this population and poses significant morbidity. Morphological changes within intervertebral discs, vertebral bodies, and spinal postural muscles affect overall spine function and astronaut performance. There remains a paucity of research related to spaceflight-induced pathologies, and currently available reviews concern the central nervous system broadly while lacking emphasis on spinal function.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to review and summarize available data regarding changes in spinal health with exposure to spaceflight, especially focusing on effects of microgravity. The authors also present promising diagnostic and treatment approaches wherein the neurosurgeon could positively impact astronauts' health and post-flight outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles included in this review were identified via search engine using MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Review, Google Scholar, and references within other relevant articles. Search criteria included ""spine and spaceflight"", ""vertebral column and spaceflight"", ""vertebral disc and spaceflight"", and ""muscle atrophy and spaceflight"", with results limited to articles written in English from 1961 to 2020. References of selected articles were included as appropriate.
RESULTS: Fifty-six articles were included in this review. Compositional changes at the intervertebral discs, vertebral bone, and paraspinal muscles contribute to undesirable effects on astronaut spinal function in space and contribute to post-flight pathologies. Risk of intervertebral disc herniation increases, especially during post-flight recovery. Vertebral bone degeneration in microgravity may increase risk for herniation and fracture. Paraspinal muscle atrophy contributes to low back pain, poorer spine health, and reduced stability.
CONCLUSION: Anatomical changes in microgravity contribute to the development of spinal pathologies. Microgravity impacts sensory neurovestibular function, neuromuscular output, genetic expression, among other systems. Future developments in imaging and therapeutic interventions may better analyze these changes and offer targeted therapeutic interventions to decrease the burden of pain and other diseases of the spine in this population.","2021",,"Clin Neurol Neurosurg"," OBJECTIVE : Our aim was to review and summarize available data regarding changes in spinal health with exposure to spaceflight , especially focusing on effects of microgravity "," review","Adaptation, Physiological, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Astronauts, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Humans, FALSE, Muscular Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Paraspinal Muscles, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Space Flight, TRUE, Spine, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Weightlessness, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The current meta-analysis aimed to compare the performance of these measures in discriminating PSP from multiple system atrophy (MSA). A systematic MEDLINE review identified 59 out of 2984 studies allowing a calculation of sensitivity and specificity using the MRPI or M/P. Meta-analyses of results were carried out using random effects modelling. To assess study quality and risk of bias, the QUADAS-2 tool was used. Eight studies were suitable for analysis.

Cardiomyocyte toxicity occurs via multiple molecular mechanisms, including topoisomerase II-mediated DNA double-strand breaks and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation via effects on the mitochondrial electron transport chain, NADPH oxidases (NOXs), and nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). Excess ROS may cause mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, calcium release, and DNA damage, which may result in cardiomyocyte dysfunction or cell death. These pathophysiologic mechanisms cause tissue-level manifestations, including characteristic histopathologic changes (myocyte vacuolization, myofibrillar loss, and cell death), atrophy and fibrosis, and organ-level manifestations including cardiac contractile dysfunction and vascular dysfunction. In addition, these mechanisms are relevant to current and emerging strategies to diagnose, prevent, and treat anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. This review details the established and emerging data regarding the molecular mechanisms of anthracycline-induced cardiovascular toxicity.","2021",,"Clin Sci (Lond)",," review","Animals, FALSE, Anthracyclines, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Antibiotics, Antineoplastic, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Cardiomyopathies, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Cardiovascular System, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Humans, FALSE, Myocytes, Cardiac, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

We have, however, encountered a series of patients whose phenotype differed from the above described entities.
METHODS: We describe a cohort of patients in whom typical idiopathic isolated (primary) late-onset focal or segmental (predominantly cervical) dystonia preceded the development of parkinsonism by several years, sometimes decades.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 450 patients followed in our botulinum toxin injections clinic, we identified 11 (2.4%; 7 women) who developed parkinsonism at a median of 14 years after the onset of dystonia. Median age at onset of parkinsonism was 70 years (range 59-87), usually manifesting with a new tremor or a change of tremor pattern, complaints of 'slowing down' or new walking difficulties. Parkinsonism resembled PD in 5 (one pathologically confirmed); the remainder had atypical parkinsonism of MSA (n = 3) or indeterminate phenotype (n = 3).
CONCLUSION: The relatively frequent occurrence of parkinsonism after long-standing dystonia would suggest a link between the two, in line with evidence from other clinical reports, imaging studies, animal models and genetics. It appears that in some cases of dystonia this could be an antecedent manifestation of a syndrome with parkinsonism developing later, or be a risk factor for parkinsonism. In practice, it is important for clinicians to be alert to new symptoms/signs in patients with long-standing dystonia. From a research point of view, longitudinal case-control studies would be required to further investigate the link between long-standing dystonia and subsequent parkinsonism.","2021",,"J Neurol Sci",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, TRUE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, Parkinsonian Disorders, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive, TRUE, Torticollis, TRUE, complications, Q000150",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The current study was aimed at assessing the frequency of camptocormia and its related factors in MSA patients with different disease durations. Also, the impact of camptocormia on disability was evaluated.
METHODS: A total of 716 patients were enrolled in the study. They were classified into three groups based on disease duration (≤ 3, 3-5, ≥ 5 years). Specific scales were used to evaluate the motor and non-motor symptoms. Disease severity was assessed using the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS). The binary logistic regression model was used to explore the factors related to camptocormia. To analyze the impact of camptocormia on disability in patients with disease duration less than 5 years, propensity score matching (PSM) and stratified Cox regression analysis were used.
RESULTS: In the current study, we found that the frequency of camptocormia was 8.9, 19.7 and 19.2% when the disease duration was ≤3, 3-5, ≥ 5 years, respectively. In the disease duration ≤3 years group, we found that MSA-parkinsonian subtype (MSA-P) (OR = 2.043, P = 0.043), higher total UMSARS score (OR = 1.063, P < 0.001), older age of onset (OR = 1.047, P = 0.042), and lower score on the frontal assessment battery (FAB) (OR = 0.899, P = 0.046) were associated with camptocormia. Only greater disease severity was associated with camptocormia in the group of patients with disease duration 3-5 years (OR = 1.494, P = 0.025) and in the group of patients with disease duration ≥5 years (OR = 1.076, P = 0.005). There was no significant impact of camptocormia on disability in patients with a disease duration of < 5 years (HR = 0.687, P = 0.463).
CONCLUSION: The frequency of camptocormia increased with prolonged disease duration. Disease severity was related to camptocormia at different stages of the disease.

METHODS: We included patients with a 'probable' MSA diagnosis for whom a clinical evaluation and a brain PET were performed early in the course of the disease (median 3 years, IQR 2-5). A retrospective analysis was conducted using standardised data collection. Brain PET metabolism was characterised using the Automated Anatomical Labelling Atlas. A Cox model was applied to look for factors influencing survival. Kaplan-Meier method estimated the survival rate. We proposed to develop a predictive 'risk score', categorised into low-risk and high-risk groups, using significant variables entered in multivariate Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were included. The overall median survival was 8 years (CI 6.64 to 9.36). Poor prognostic factors were orthostatic hypotension (HR=6.04 (CI 1.58 to 23.12), p=0.009), stridor (HR=3.41 (CI 1.31 to 8.87), p=0.012) and glucose PET hypometabolism in the left insula (HR=0.78 (CI 0.66 to 0.92), p=0.004). Good prognostic factors were time to diagnosis (HR=0.68 (CI 0.54 to 0.86), p=0.001) and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (HR=0.17 (CI 0.06 to 0.46), p<0.001). The risk score revealed a 5-year gap separating the median survival of the two groups obtained (5 years vs 10 years; HR=5.82 (CI 2.94 to 11.49), p<0.001).

Dysphagia is a frequent and disabling symptom in MSA and its occurrence within 5 years of motor onset is an additional diagnostic feature. Dysphagia can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a recognized cause of death in MSA. Guidelines for diagnosis and management of dysphagia in MSA are lacking. An International Consensus Conference among experts with methodological support was convened in Bologna to reach consensus statements for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of dysphagia in MSA. Abnormalities of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, esophageal dysfunction and aspiration occur in MSA and worsen as the disease progresses. According to the consensus, dysphagia should be investigated through available screening questionnaires and clinical and instrumental assessment (videofluoroscopic study or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and manometry) at the time of MSA diagnosis and periodically thereafter. There is evidence that dysphagia is associated with poor survival in MSA, however effective treatments for dysphagia are lacking. Compensatory strategies like diet modification, swallowing maneuvers and head postures should be applied and botulinum toxin injection may be effective in specific conditions. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy may be performed when there is a severe risk of malnutrition and pulmonary complications, but its impact on survival is undetermined.

We also reviewed the clinical records of another 105 patients with pathologically confirmed Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy, who had received a correct final clinical diagnosis (i.e. Parkinson's disease, n = 35; progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson syndrome, n = 35; and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism, n = 35). We investigated 12 red flag features that would support a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy according to the current diagnostic criteria. Compared with typical multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease mimics more frequently had a good levodopa response and visual hallucinations. Vertical gaze palsy and apraxia of eyelid opening were more commonly observed in progressive supranuclear palsy mimics. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an increased likelihood of having multiple system atrophy [Parkinson's disease mimic versus typical Parkinson's disease, odds ratio (OR): 8.1; progressive supranuclear palsy mimic versus typical progressive supranuclear palsy, OR: 2.3] if a patient developed any one of seven selected red flag features in the first 10 years of disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive dysfunction of specific populations of neurons, determining clinical presentation. Neuronal loss is associated with extra- and intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins. The parkinsonian diseases affect distinct areas of the brain. PD and MSA belong to a group of synucleinopathies that are characterized by the presence of fibrillary aggregates of α-synuclein protein in the cytoplasm of selected populations of neurons and glial cells.

We evaluated the morbidity, mortality, and rate of conversion to a neurodegenerative disorder in a national group of patients.
METHODS: All patients in Denmark with a diagnosis of RBD between 2006 and 2013 were identified from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) records. We excluded patients who had received a diagnosis of narcolepsy or any of the following neurodegenerative diseases before their diagnosis of RBD: Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear paralysis, Alzheimer's, and Lewy body dementia. We used randomly chosen controls matched for age, gender, and municipality.
RESULTS: In total, 246 iRBD patients and 982 matched controls were analyzed. The mortality rate was the same in both groups. The morbidity rate was significantly higher in the years before and after an RBD diagnosis, due to a wide variety of disorders in the following major disease groups: mental/behavioral disorders; endocrine/metabolic diseases; diseases of the eye; diseases of the nervous, digestive, musculoskeletal, circulatory, and respiratory systems; abnormal findings not classified elsewhere; external causes; and factors influencing health status. The conversion rate from RBD to a neurodegenerative disease was 13% over the 8 years after a diagnosis of RBD.

This review provides an overview of both well established and emerging predictors of disability worsening, including clinical factors, imaging factors, biomarkers and treatment strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to well known clinical predictors (age, male sex, clinical presentation, relapse behaviour), smoking, obesity, vascular and psychiatric comorbidities are associated with subsequent disability worsening in persons with MS. A number of imaging features are predictive of disability worsening and are present to varying degrees in relapsing and progressive forms of MS. These include brain volumes, spinal cord atrophy, lesion volumes and optical coherence tomography features. Cerebrospinal and more recently blood biomarkers including neurofilament light show promise as more easily attainable biomarkers of future disability accumulation. Importantly, recent observational studies suggest that initiation of early-intensive therapy, as opposed to escalation based on breakthrough disease, is associated with decreased accumulation of disability overall, although randomized controlled trials investigating this question are underway.

The goal of treatment is not to normalize blood pressure but rather to improve quality of life and prevent syncope and falls by reducing symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion. Patients not able to recognize NOH symptoms are at a higher risk for falls. The first step in the management of NOH is to educate patients on how to avoid high-risk situations and providers to identify medications that trigger or worsen NOH. Conservative countermeasures, including diet and compression garments, should always precede pharmacologic therapies. Volume expanders (fludrocortisone and desmopressin) should be used with caution. Drugs that enhance residual sympathetic tone (pyridostigmine and atomoxetine) are more effective in patients with mild disease and in MSA patients with spared postganglionic fibers. Norepinephrine replacement therapy (midodrine and droxidopa) is more effective in patients with neurodegeneration of peripheral noradrenergic fibers like PAF. NOH is often associated with other cardiovascular diseases, most notably supine hypertension, and treatment should be adapted to their presence.","2021",,"Am J Hypertens",," review","Humans, FALSE, Hypotension, Orthostatic, TRUE, physiopathology, Q000503, Synucleinopathies, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, systematic knowledge about the first reported clinical symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases is lacking. Therefore, the aim was to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of the first clinical symptom (FS) as assessed by medical history in neuropathologically proven neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: Neuropathological diagnoses from the Neurobiobank Munich, Germany, were matched with clinical records for analyses of the diagnostic and prognostic values of FSs.
RESULTS: In all, 301 patients with the neuropathological diagnoses Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Lewy body disease (LBD) including the neuropathologically indistinguishable clinical phenotypes Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy (MSA) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) were studied. Memory disturbance was the most common FS in AD (34%), FTLD (19%) and LBD (26%), gait disturbance in PSP (35%) and MSA (27%) and aphasia and personality changes in CBD (20%, respectively). In a model adjusting for prevalence in the general population, AD was predicted by memory disturbance in 79.0%, aphasia in 97.2%, personality changes in 96.0% and by cognitive disturbance in 99.0%. Gait disturbance and tremor predicted LBD in 54.6% and 97.3%, coordination disturbance MSA in 59.4% and dysarthria FTLD in 73.0%. Cognitive FSs were associated with longer survival in AD (12.0 vs. 5.3 years; p < 0.001) and FTLD (8.2 vs. 4.1 years; p = 0.005) and motor FSs with shorter survival in PSP (7.2 vs. 9.7; p = 0.048).

METHODS: A cohort of 99 MSA patients was studied retrospectively. Their BP measurements were obtained during prolonged (40 min, vertical position) drug-free tilt testing. We used K-M survival curves and Cox regression to calculate adjusted (to age of onset) hazard ratios (HRs) of BP measurements on time to death by MSA subtype and sex.
RESULTS: Fifty-two MSA patients were males and 47 were females. Sixty-three of them had MSA-P and 36 had MSA-C. The mean age at motor symptom onset was 61.1 ± 10.4 years, and mean disease duration at the time of BP assessment was 8.0 ± 4.7 years. The 2 study groups (MSA-P and MSA-C) did not differ significantly in age at MSA onset, sex ratio, or disease duration. Survival time did not differ between the groups {medians: 12 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-28) and 10 years (95% CI: 8-13), respectively}. The MSA-P group showed a trend towards better survival for males (log-rank p = 0.0925). The maximal diastolic orthostatic BP decline during tilt testing had a borderline positive association with death risk among MSA-C males (adjusted HR = 1.18, p = 0.0665), and systolic BP after 10 min in a supine position had a significant positive association with death risk among MSA-P males (adjusted HR = 1.06, p = 0.0354).

Evidence about the prognostic differences between PSP phenotypes is scarce and focused on PSP-RS vs. non-PSP-RS. Using a brain-bank cohort we assessed PSP survival not only in PSP-RS vs. non-PSP-RS, but also in PSP-RS + cortical vs. subcortical phenotypes. Besides, we assessed sensitivity and specificity of the MDS-PSP criteria in of PSP and other degenerative parkinsonisms.
METHODS: We retrospectively applied the MDS-PSP diagnostic criteria to 32 definite PSP cases and 30 cases with other degenerative parkinsonian syndromes (Parkinson's disease [PD; n = 11], multiple system atrophy [MSA; n = 11], corticobasal degeneration [CBD; n = 8]). We conducted survival statistics in neuropathologically confirmed PSP cases considering PSP-RS vs. non-PSP-RS and PSP-RS + PSP-cortical (PSP-F + PSP-SL + PSP-CBS) vs. PSP-subcortical (PSP-P + PSP-PGF) phenotypes. We also adjusted survival analyses for PSP tau scores.
RESULTS: Diagnostic sensitivity was 100% and specificity ranged from 47% to 87% when excluding cases that met the ""suggestive of PSP"" definition early in their disease course but with other clinical features better matching with a non-PSP pathological diagnosis. Survival was significantly shorter in PSP-RS vs. non-PSP-RS cases, but it was more markedly shorter in PSP-RS + PSP-cortical vs. PSP-subcortical, independently of PSP tau scores, which were not associated with survival.

An accurate natural history of MSA is important for clinical trials, but is insufficient. This regional registry was launched to complement clinical information on MSA.
SETTING: Patient recruitment started in November 2014 and is ongoing at the time of submission. The number of participating facilities was 66. Postal surveys were sent to medical facilities and patients with MSA in Hokkaido, Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: After obtaining written consent from 196 participants, 184 overview surveys and 115 detailed surveys were conducted.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: An overview survey evaluated conformity to diagnostic criteria and a detailed survey implemented an annual assessment based on the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS).
RESULTS: At the time of registration, 58.2% of patients were diagnosed with cerebellar symptoms predominant type MSA (MSA-C) and 29.9% were diagnosed with parkinsonism predominant type MSA (MSA-P). UMSARS Part Ⅳ score of 4 or 5 accounted for 53.8% of participants. The higher the UMSARS Part Ⅳ score, the higher the proportion of MSA-P. At baseline, levodopa was used by 69 patients (37.5%) and the average levodopa dose was 406.7 mg/day. The frequency of levodopa use increased over time. Eleven cases changed from MSA-C to MSA-P during the study, but the opposite was not observed. Information about survival and causes of death was collected on 54 cases. Half of deaths were respiratory-related. Sudden death was recorded even in the group with UMSARS Part Ⅳ score of 1.

Either Cohen's d or positive and negative likelihood (LR+/-) as well as diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) were calculated as appropriate. cMRI parameter was considered useful if Cohen's d > 1.94 (<20% overlap) or if LR+ > 10, LR- < 0.1, or DOR > 20.
RESULTS: Literature search identified 8848 publications and 36 were included for analysis. Putaminal (Cohen's d 2.07; DOR 23-infinity), pontine (DOR 32-infinity), and middle cerebellar peduncle (Cohen's d 2.24; DOR infinity) abnormalities were most useful in differentiating multiple system atrophy while reduced midbrain (Cohen's d 2.33-8.69; DOR infinity) and superior cerebellar peduncle (Cohen's d 2.47; DOR 51-infinity) diameters separated progressive supranuclear palsy.

METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple system atrophy patients and 346 controls.

PATIENTS/METHODS: We surveyed 70 sleep medicine physicians with RBD expertise for demographic information, counseling practices, and their beliefs and understandings concerning the association between RBD and synucleinopathies, among other questions. Responses were summarized by descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Among the 44 respondents (63% response rate), 41 (93.2%) regularly provided prognostic counseling for most RBD patients, but only 31.8% routinely asked about patient preferences on receiving counseling. 41.8% believed that the risk for developing overt synucleinopathy following RBD diagnosis was >80%, but only 15.9% routinely provided this detailed phenoconversion risk estimate to their patients. Most respondents were concerned that RBD prognostic counseling could adversely impact on the patient's and family's mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: Most expert RBD sleep clinicians routinely counsel their patients regarding the high risk for phenoconversion to parkinsonism or dementia, yet relatively few routinely ask patients about their preferences for receiving this information, and fewer provide details concerning the known high risk estimates for developing a synucleinopathy.

The alteration of protein homeostasis is generally due to increased protein breakdown while, protein synthesis may also be down-regulated. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a master regulator of skeletal muscle that impacts muscle contractile properties and metabolism through multiple levers like signaling pathways, contractile apparatus degradation, etc. Among the different actors of the UPS, the E3 ubiquitin ligases specifically target key proteins for either degradation or activity modulation, thus controlling both pro-anabolic or pro-catabolic factors. The atrogenes MuRF1/TRIM63 and MAFbx/Atrogin-1 encode for key E3 ligases that target contractile proteins and key actors of protein synthesis respectively. However, several other E3 ligases are involved upstream in the atrophy program, from signal transduction control to modulation of energy balance. Controlling E3 ligases activity is thus a tempting approach for preserving muscle mass. While indirect modulation of E3 ligases may prove beneficial in some situations of muscle atrophy, some drugs directly inhibiting their activity have started to appear.

KATP channels are hetero-multimeric complexes of sulfonylureas receptors (SUR1, SUR2A or SUR2B) and the pore-forming subunits (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) likewise expressed in the pre-post synapsis of neurons and inflammatory cells, thereby affecting their proliferation and activity. KATP channels are involved in amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced pathology, therefore emerging as therapeutic targets against Alzheimer's and related diseases. The modulation of these channels can represent an innovative strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders; nevertheless, the currently available drugs are not selective for brain KATP channels and show contrasting effects. This phenomenon can be a consequence of the multiple physiological roles of the different varieties of KATP channels. Openings of cardiac and muscular KATP channel subunits, are protective against caspase-dependent atrophy in these tissues and some neurodegenerative disorders, whereas in some neuroinflammatory diseases, benefits can be obtained through the inhibition of neuronal KATP channel subunits. For example, glibenclamide exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in respiratory, digestive, urological, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases, as well as in ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with abnormal SUR1-Trpm4/TNF-α or SUR1-Trpm4/ Nos2/ROS signaling. Despite this strategy being promising, glibenclamide may have limited clinical efficacy due to its unselective blocking action of SUR2A/B subunits also expressed in cardiovascular apparatus with pro-arrhythmic effects and SUR1 expressed in pancreatic beta cells with hypoglycemic risk.

However, there are currently no validated automatic methods for quantification of PML lesion burden or associated parenchymal volume loss. Furthermore, manual brain or lesion delineations can be tedious, require the use of valuable time resources by radiologists or trained experts, and are often subjective. In this work, we introduce JCnet (named after the causative viral agent), an end-to-end, fully automated method for brain parenchymal and lesion segmentation in PML using consecutive 3D patch-based convolutional neural networks. The network architecture consists of multi-view feature pyramid networks with hierarchical residual learning blocks containing embedded batch normalization and nonlinear activation functions. The feature maps across the bottom-up and top-down pathways of the feature pyramids are merged, and an output probability membership generated through convolutional pathways, thus rendering the method fully convolutional. Our results show that this approach outperforms and improves longitudinal consistency compared to conventional, state-of-the-art methods of healthy brain and multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation, utilized here as comparators given the lack of available methods validated for use in PML.

METHODS: Gait metrics were recorded in 11 multiple system atrophy, 12 Parkinson's disease patients, and 18 controls using sensor-based gait analysis. Gait variability was analyzed for stride, swing and stance time, stride length and gait velocity.

Stride time variability was significantly higher in slow compared to comfortable walking in patients with multiple system atrophy (P = 0.014). Variability parameters significantly correlated with the postural instability/gait difficulty subscore in both disease groups. Conversely, significant correlations between variability parameters and MDS-UPDRS III score was observed only for multiple system atrophy patients.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that gait variability parameters reflect the major axial impairment and postural instability displayed by multiple system atrophy patients compared with Parkinson's disease patients and controls.","2021",,"J Neurol"," OBJECTIVES : We compared gait variability at different walking velocities between and within groups of patients with Parkinson-variant multiple system atrophy , idiopathic Parkinson's disease , and a control group of older adults ","other","Aged, FALSE, Gait, FALSE, Gait Disorders, Neurologic, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Walking, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, little is known about the pathogenesis of systemic complications of COVID-19. Here, we create a murine model of SARS-CoV-2-induced severe systemic toxicity and multiorgan involvement by expressing the human ACE2 transgene in multiple tissues via viral delivery, followed by systemic administration of SARS-CoV-2. The animals develop a profound phenotype within 7 days with severe weight loss, morbidity, and failure to thrive. We demonstrate that there is metabolic suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in multiple organs with neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and splenic atrophy, mirroring human COVID-19 phenotypes. Animals had a significantly lower heart rate, and electron microscopy demonstrated myofibrillar disarray and myocardial edema, a common pathogenic cardiac phenotype in human COVID-19. We performed metabolomic profiling of peripheral blood and identified a panel of TCA cycle metabolites that served as biomarkers of depressed oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 induces epigenetic changes of DNA methylation, which affects expression of immune response genes and could, in part, contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Cervical and ocular VEMPs combined with clinical tests for postural imbalance predicted future fall incidents in both PD and AP groups with a sensitivity of 100%. A positive predictive value of 68% was achieved, if only one VEMP test was abnormal, and of 83% when both VEMP tests were abnormal.

Given reduced subcortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) is prevalent in SVD, we tested the hypothesis that regional CBF is positively associated with gait performance among older adults.
METHODS: Thirty-two older adults (55-80 years) with at least one vascular risk factor were recruited. We assessed gait during 2 consecutive walking sequences using a GAITRite system: (1) at a self-selected pace, and (2) while performing a serial subtraction dual-task challenge. We quantified CBF using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI within 4 regions of interest: putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and hippocampus. We investigated associations between gait characteristics and overall CBF adjusting for age, sex, and height in an omnibus approach using multivariate analysis of variance, followed by regression analysis with each individual region. We also conducted further regression analyses to investigate associations between gait characteristics and frontal lobe CBF.

Mitochondrial health influences neurodegeneration and defects in mitochondria, particularly in oxidative phosphorylation, are reported in MSA. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) codes for 13 critical OXPHOS proteins, however no study has investigated if mtDNA variation, in the form of mitochondrial haplogroups, influences MSA risk. Therefore, in this study we investigated the association of mtDNA haplogroups with MSA risk in a case-control manner.
METHODS: 176 pathologically confirmed MSA cases and 910 neurologically healthy controls from Mayo Clinic Jacksonville were genotyped for 39 unique mtDNA variants using Agena Biosciences MassARRAY iPlex technology. Mitochondrial haplogroups were assigned to mitochondrial phylogeny, and logistic regression models that were adjusted for age and sex were used to assess associations between mitochondrial haplogroups and risk of MSA.
RESULTS: After adjusting for multiple testing (P<0.0019 considered significant), no mitochondrial haplogroups were significantly associated with MSA risk. However, several nominally significant (P<0.05) associations were observed; haplogroup I was associated with a decreased risk of MSA (OR=0.09, P=0.021), while an increased risk of MSA was observed for haplogroups H3 (OR=2.43, P=0.017) and T1 and T2 (OR=2.04, P=0.007).

,"33189759","Molecular and neural adaptations to neuromuscular electrical stimulation; Implications for ageing muscle.","Guo Y","One of the most notable effects of ageing is an accelerated decline of skeletal muscle mass and function, resulting in various undesirable outcomes such as falls, frailty, and all-cause mortality. The loss of muscle mass directly leads to functional deficits and can be explained by the combined effects of individual fibre atrophy and fibre loss. The gradual degradation of fibre atrophy is attributed to impaired muscle protein homeostasis, while muscle fibre loss is a result of denervation and motor unit (MU) remodelling. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), a substitute for voluntary contractions, has been applied to reduce muscle mass and functional declines. However, the measurement of the effectiveness of NMES in terms of its mechanism of action on the peripheral motor nervous system and neuromuscular junction, and multiple molecular adaptations at the single fibre level is not well described. NMES mediates neuroplasticity and upregulates a number of neurotropic factors, manifested by increased axonal sprouting and newly formed neuromuscular junctions. Repeated involuntary contractions increase the activity levels of oxidative enzymes, increase fibre capillarisation and can influence fibre type conversion. Additionally, following NMES muscle protein synthesis is increased as well as functional capacity. This review will detail the neural, molecular, metabolic and functional adaptations to NMES in human and animal studies.","2021",,"Mech Ageing Dev",," review","Aging, TRUE, pathology, Q000473, Animals, FALSE, Cellular Senescence, FALSE, Electric Stimulation Therapy, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Humans, FALSE, Muscle, Skeletal, TRUE, innervation, Q000294, Muscular Atrophy, TRUE, metabolism, Q000378, Neuromuscular Junction, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Signal Transduction, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

RESULTS: We identified 161 articles from database searching and bibliographic review. Five case-control studies satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 435 and 352 healthy controls and MSA patients were examined. The prevalence of MSA amongst ever smokers was lower compared to never smokers (aOR=0.57; 95% CI, 0.29-1.14), although this result did not reach statistical significance. This was also observed for current and former smokers, with a stronger association for current smokers (aOR=0.63 vs aOR=0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a suggestion that smoking protects against MSA. Prospective studies in larger patient cohorts are required to further evaluate the cause-effect relationship and functional studies in cellular and animal models will provide mechanistic insights on their potential etiologic links.
METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to July 7, 2019 to identify case-control studies that analyzed smoking as an environmental risk or protective factor for MSA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serum neurofilament light as a biomarker associated with long-term disease outcomes in clinically isolated syndrome.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This post hoc cohort study used data from the Controlled High-Risk Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention Study, a 36-month, multicenter, placebo-controlled interferon β-1a randomized clinical trial conducted from April 1996 to March 2000, and its long-term (5- and 10-year) extension study from February 2001 to March 2009. Participants included individuals with a symptomatic initial demyelinating event and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions suggestive of MS. Data were analyzed from April 2017 through 2019.
EXPOSURE: The variable of interest was naturally occurring serum neurofilament light concentration.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion number, T2 lesion volume, and brain parenchymal fraction, a measure of brain atrophy were measured at baseline and 5 and 10 years. Multivariate regression models evaluated whether age, sex, and baseline covariates, including serum neurofilament light, brain parenchymal fraction, Expanded Disability Status Scale, Gd+ lesion count, and T2 lesion volume, were associated with brain parenchymal fraction changes over 5 and 10 years.
RESULTS: Among 308 included participants (mean [SD] age, 33.2 [7.6] years; 234 [76.0%] women), baseline serum neurofilament light concentrations were associated with Gd+ lesions (Spearman r = 0.41; P < .001) and T2 lesion volume (Spearman r = 0.42; P < .001). Among covariates for brain parenchymal fraction change, serum neurofilament light concentration had the greatest correlation with change in brain parenchymal fraction at 5 years (Spearman r = -0.38; P < .001) and was the only variable associated with brain parenchymal fraction at 10 years (Spearman r = -0.45; P < .001). Participants in the highest vs lowest baseline serum neurofilament light tertiles showed brain parenchymal fraction reduction at 5 years (-1.83% [95% CI, -1.49% to -2.18%] vs -0.95% [95% CI, -0.78% to -1.12%]; P < .001) and 10 years (-3.54% [95% CI, -2.90% to -4.17%] vs -1.90% [95% CI, -1.43% to -2.37%]; P < .001). At 5 years, 6 of 45 participants (13.3%) in the highest neurofilament tertile and 2 of 52 participants (3.8%) in the lowest neurofilament tertile achieved an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3.5 or greater.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that higher baseline serum neurofilament light levels were associated with increased brain atrophy over 5 and 10 years.

Diet type level usually is assessed by video fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). To identify a simpler assessment method, we examined the association between diet type (based on the Functional Oral Intake Scale [FOIS]) diet type and maximum tongue pressure (MTP).
METHODS: From 2011-2020, FOIS diet type level and MTP were assessed in a sample of 927 patients. Of these patients, 186 had Parkinson's disease (PD), 69 had Parkinson-related disease (PRD), 61 had multiple system atrophy (MSA), 42 had spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), 147 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 180 had myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), and 242 had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). VFSS was conducted while patients swallowed water and foods containing barium. MTP measurements were collected the same day. Participants' diet type level was adjusted based on the VFSS, with some participants requiring multiple examinations. Relationships between diet type level and MTP were tested using univariate and Spearman rank correlation analyses.
RESULTS: Mean MTP for the entire NNMD group (25.5 ± 13.1 kPa) was lower than that of healthy elderly individuals, as determined in previous reports. The highest MTP was found in the MSA group (32.2 ± 15.7 kPa) and the lowest in the DM1 group (19.1 ± 9.0 kPa). Diet type level was highest in the MSA group (5.8 ± 1.4) and lowest in the DMD group (5.2 ± 1.7). A significant correlation was observed between diet type level and MTP (R = 0.384, p < 0.001).

METHODS: Olfaction was tested using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT-40) in 140 consecutive patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD and in 77 matched controls. Patients were followed-up during 5.6 ± 3.9 (range 0.2-13) years. Twenty-one patients underwent serial UPSIT-40 evaluations at 1-3 and 4-6 years after baseline.
RESULTS: UPSIT-40 score was lower in patients than in controls (20.2 ± 6.5 vs. 28.6 ± 5.0; p < 0.001). Hyposmia (UPSIT-40 score < 19 points) occurred in 42.9% patients. Forty-three (30.7%) patients developed Parkinson disease (PD = 27), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB = 13) and multiple system atrophy (MSA = 3). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that hyposmics had higher risk than normosmics to develop a synucleinopathy at the short term (p = 0.030). UPSIT-40 score was similar between patients who developed PD and DLB (p = 0.136). Normal smell occurred in all three (100%) IRBD patients who developed MSA, 12 of 27 (44%) who developed PD, and 4 of 13 (31%) that developed DLB. Serial UPSIT-40 evaluations showed no changes with time (p = 0.518).
CONCLUSION: In IRBD, hyposmia is a short-term risk for synucleinopathies but cannot distinguish underlying PD from DLB. Normosmia not only occurs in latent MSA but also in latent PD and DLB. In future IRBD neuroprotective trails, individuals at entry could be enriched for hyposmia, whereas serial evaluation of smell would not be useful to monitor the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention.","2021",,"J Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : To determine if hyposmia in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder ( IRBD ) predicts short-term conversion to any α-synucleinopathy and declines with time ","other","Anosmia, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, TRUE, Parkinson Disease, TRUE, complications, Q000150, Polysomnography, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, TRUE, complications, Q000150",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

In community dwellers, OH prevalence is estimated at 16%, whereas in institutionalized patients, it may be as high as 60%. The prevalence of OH increases exponentially with age, particularly in those 75 years and older. Multiple epidemiological studies have identified OH as a risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease including heart failure and stroke. Real-world data from administrative databases found polypharmacy, multiple co-morbid conditions, and high health-care utilization as common characteristics in OH patients. A comprehensive evaluation of medications associated with OH is discussed with particular emphasis on the use of anti-hypertensive therapy from two large clinical trials on high-intensive versus standard blood pressure management.

METHODS: Individual-level data from 19 885 participants from four population-based studies, and 1379 highly myopic participants (defined as axial length (AL) >26.0 mm) from three clinic-based/school-based studies of the Asian Eye Epidemiology Consortium were pooled. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the meta-analysis for pathologic myopia classification and defined as the presence of diffuse choroidal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, with or without 'plus' lesion (lacquer crack, choroidal neovascularisation or Fuchs' spot). Area under the curve (AUC) evaluation for predictors was performed for the population-based studies.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MMD was 0.4%, 0.5%, 1.5% and 5.2% among Asians in rural India, Beijing, Russia and Singapore, respectively. In the population-based studies, older age (per year; OR=1.13), female (OR=2.0), spherical equivalent (SE; per negative diopter; OR=1.7), longer AL (per mm; OR=3.1) and lower education (OR=1.9) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment (all p<0.001). Similarly, in the clinic-based/school-based studies, older age (OR=1.07; p<0.001), female (OR=2.1; p<0.001), longer AL (OR=2.1; p<0.001) and lower education (OR=1.7; p=0.005) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment. SE had the highest AUC of 0.92, followed by AL (AUC=0.87). The combination of SE, age, education and gender had a marginally higher AUC (0.94).

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of short-term integrated palliative care in improving symptoms, improving patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes and reducing hospital use for people severely affected by long-term neurological conditions.
DESIGN: Pragmatic, randomised controlled, multicentre, fast-track trial, with an embedded qualitative component and surveys.
SETTING: Seven UK centres (South London, Nottingham, Liverpool, Cardiff, Brighton, Ashford and Sheffield) with multiprofessional palliative care teams and neurology services.
PARTICIPANTS: People living with multiple sclerosis, idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy, with unresolved symptoms and/or complex psychosocial needs. The qualitative study involved patients, caregivers and health-care staff.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to receive short-term integrated palliative care, delivered by multiprofessional teams, immediately or after a 12-week wait (standard care group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a combined score of eight symptoms measured by the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Neurological conditions 8 symptom subscale (IPOS Neuro-S8) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included patients’ other physical and psychological symptoms, quality of life (EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version), care satisfaction, caregiver burden, service use and cost, and harms. Data were analysed using multiple imputation, generalised linear mixed models, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (threshold was the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year) and cost-effectiveness planes. Qualitative data were analysed thematically.
RESULTS: We recruited 350 patients and 229 caregivers. There were no significant between-group differences for primary or secondary outcomes. Patients receiving short-term integrated palliative care had a significant improvement, from baseline to 12 weeks, on the primary outcome IPOS Neuro-S8 (–0.78, 95% confidence interval –1.29 to –0.26) and the secondary outcome of 24 physical symptoms (–1.95, 99.55% confidence interval –3.60 to –0.30). This was not seen in the control group, in which conversely, care satisfaction significantly reduced from baseline to 12 weeks (–2.89, 99.55% confidence interval –5.19 to –0.59). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were smaller than the set threshold (EuroQol-5 Dimensions index score –£23,545; IPOS Neuro-S8 –£1519), indicating that the intervention provided cost savings plus better outcomes. Deaths, survival and hospitalisations were similar between the two groups. Qualitative data suggested that the impact of the intervention encompassed three themes: (1) adapting to losses and building resilience, (2) attending to function, deficits and maintaining stability, and (3) enabling caregivers to care.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that short-term integrated palliative care provides improvements in patient-reported physical symptoms at a lower cost and without harmful effects when compared with standard care.
LIMITATIONS: Outcome measures may not have been sensitive enough to capture the multidimensional changes from the intervention. Our surveys found that the control/standard and intervention services were heterogeneous.

However, high-quality evidence to support palliative care policy and service developments for patients with long-term neurological conditions (LTNCs) is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a short-term integrated palliative care (SIPC) intervention for people with LTNCs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, phase 3, randomized clinical trial conducted from April 1, 2015, to November 30, 2017, with a last follow-up date of May 31, 2018, in 7 UK hospitals with both neurology and palliative care services. A total of 535 patients with LTNC were assessed for eligibility and 350 were randomized. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 years or older with any advanced stage of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, idiopathic Parkinson disease multiple system atrophy, or progressive supranuclear palsy. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 using minimization method to receive SIPC (intervention, n = 176) or standard care (control, n = 174).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in 8 key palliative care symptoms from baseline to 12-weeks, measured by the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for neurological conditions. Secondary outcomes included change in the burden of other symptoms, health-related quality of life, caregiver burden, and costs. Data were collected and analyzed blindly by intention to treat.
RESULTS: A total of 350 patients (mean [SD] age 67 [12] years; years since diagnosis, 12 [range, 0-56]; 51% men; 49% requiring considerable assistance) with an advanced stage of LTNC were recruited, along with informal caregivers (n = 229). There were no between-group differences in primary outcome (effect size, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.05), any other patient-reported outcomes, adverse events, or survival. Although there was more symptom reduction in the SIPC group in relation to mean change in primary outcome, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (-0.78; 95% CI, -1.29 to -0.26 vs -0.28; 95% CI, -0.82 to 0.26; P = .14). There was a decrease in mean health and social care costs from baseline to 12 weeks -$1367 (95% CI, -$2450 to -$282) in the SIPC group and -653 (95% CI, -$1839 to -$532) in the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .12). SIPC was perceived by patients and caregivers as building resilience, attending to function and deficits, and enabling caregivers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, SIPC was not statistically significantly different from standard care for the patient-reported outcomes. However, SIPC was associated with lower cost, and in qualitative analysis was well-received by patients and caregivers, and there were no safety concerns. Further research is warranted.

A role for this in neurodegenerative diseases has long been hypothesised, and technical developments are now allowing the question to be addressed in detail. The rapidly accumulating evidence is discussed in this review, with a focus on recent developments. Somatic mutations of numerous types may occur, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), and retrotransposon insertions. They could act as initiators or risk factors, especially if they arise in development, although they could also result from the disease process, potentially contributing to progression. In common sporadic neurodegenerative disorders, relevant mutations have been reported in synucleinopathies, comprising somatic gains of SNCA in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and in Alzheimer's disease, where a novel recombination mechanism leading to somatic variants of APP, as well as an excess of somatic SNVs affecting tau phosphorylation, have been reported. In Mendelian repeat expansion disorders, mosaicism due to somatic instability, first detected 25 years ago, has come to the forefront. Brain somatic SNVs occur in DNA repair disorders, and there is evidence for a role of several ALS genes in DNA repair.

Five S1P receptors (S1PR1-5) have been identified, each with effects determined by their unique G-protein-driven downstream pathways. The discovery that lymphocyte egress from peripheral lymphoid organs is promoted by S1P via S1PR-1 stimulation led to the development of pharmacological agents which are S1PR antagonists. These agents promote lymphocyte sequestration and reduce lymphocyte-driven inflammatory damage of the central nervous system (CNS) in animal models, encouraging their examination of efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Preclinical research has also demonstrated direct protective effects of S1PR antagonists within the CNS, by modulation of S1PRs, particularly S1PR-1 and S1PR-5, and possibly S1PR-2, independent of effects upon lymphocytes. Three of these agents, fingolimod, siponimod and ozanimod have been approved, and ponesimod has been submitted for regulatory approval. In patients with MS, these agents reduce relapse risk, sustained disability progression, magnetic resonance imaging markers of disease activity, and whole brain and/or cortical and deep gray matter atrophy.

METHOD: A total of 93 patients with Parkinson's disease and related disorders were identified by review of PEG registers and by searching the administrative databases in 2 large UK university hospitals (2005-2017); 83 case notes were available for retrospective review. Care processes and outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: The following were the diagnoses: 58 (70%) had Parkinson's disease, 10 (12%) had progressive supranuclear palsy, 5 (6%) had multiple system atrophy, 3 (4%) had dementia with Lewy bodies, and 7 (8%) had vascular parkinsonism. The median age was 78 years (interquartile range 72-82); 29 (35%) were women. Care processes included a future care plan in place prior to admission for 18 patients (22%), and PEG was placed during emergency admission in 68 patients (82%). The outcomes included median survival at 422 days; 30-day mortality rate was 6% (5 patients); and of 56 patients admitted from home, 18 (32%) were discharged to institutions (nursing or care homes).

The risk is well-established in Lewy body disease but is not as confirmed for multiple system atrophy (MSA). We aim to evaluate associations between exonic variants in GBA and risk of neuropathologically-confirmed multiple system atrophy (MSA).
METHODS: Sanger gene sequencing of GBA was performed on 167 pathologically confirmed MSA patients collected at Mayo Clinic Florida Brain Bank, and data were extracted from whole-genome sequencing of 834 clinical controls. Common GBA variants were assessed for association with MSA. Rare GBA variants (and also all GBA variants) were collapsed together and evaluated for association with MSA risk using a gene-burden test.
RESULTS: A total of 17 exonic GBA variants were observed, including a novel p.Q112X variant that is likely pathogenic in a patient with mixed parkinsonism-cerebellar subtype MSA. The more common p.N409S and p.L483P variants that recessively cause Gaucher's disease (GD), and are associated with risk of Lewy body disease, were not observed. When collapsing across all GBA variants, the presence of any GBA variant was significantly more frequent in MSA patients than in controls (OR = 1.90, P = 0.031). However, this association was driven by p.T408M, which had a significantly higher frequency in MSA patients compared to controls (OR = 4.21, P = 0.002). There was no significant association with risk of MSA for the p.E365K variant (OR = 0.79, P = 0.72).

There are two main types of MNs, spinal and cortical MNs and depending on the type of MND, one or both types are affected. Cortical MNs innervate spinal MNs and these control a variety of cellular targets, being skeletal muscle their main one which is also affected in MNDs. A correct functionality of autophagy is necessary for the survival of all cellular types and it is particularly crucial for neurons, given their postmitotic and highly specialized nature. Numerous studies have identified alterations of autophagy activity in multiple MNDs. The scientific community has been particularly prolific in reporting the role that autophagy plays in the most common adult MND, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although many studies have started to identify physiological and pathological functions of this catabolic system in other MNDs, such as spinal muscular atrophy and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. The degradation of selective cargo by autophagy and how this process is altered upon the presence of MND-causing mutations is currently also a matter of intense investigation, particularly regarding the selective autophagic clearance of mitochondria. Thorough reviews on this field have been recently published.

These diseases, collectively referred to as 'synucleinopathies', have long been considered purely proteinopathies: diseases characterized by the misfolding of a protein into small and large aggregates mainly consisting of that protein (in this case: α-synuclein). However, recent morphological insights into Lewy bodies, the hallmark neuropathology of human synucleinopathies, suggests these lesions are also rich in vesicles and other membranous organelles. Moreover, αS physiology and pathology are both strongly associated with various aspects of intracellular vesicle trafficking and lipid biology. αS physiologically binds to synaptic and other small vesicles, and several functions of αS in regulating vesicle biology have been proposed. Familial PD-linked αS excess and missense mutations have been shown to impair vesicle trafficking and alter lipid homeostasis. On the other hand, vesicle trafficking and lipid-related genes have emerged as Parkinson's risk factors, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. The answer to the question ""Does abnormal αS accumulation cause impaired vesicle trafficking and lipid dyshomeostasis or is αS aggregation the consequence of such impairments?"" may be ""Both"".

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with PAF from 2001 to 2011 evaluated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester. Clinical follow-up and patient telephone calls were used to assess for development of symptoms and diagnosis of MSA, PD, or DLB. Clinical and laboratory variables were extracted with factors predictive of evolution assessed using group comparison, odds ratio, and logistical regression.
RESULTS: Among 275 patients with PAF at presentation, 67 (24%) phenoconverted to a synucleinopathy with motor or cognitive involvement; 34 met criteria for MSA, while 33 met criteria for PD or DLB. Age at onset was younger in MSA phenoconverters. Clinical features at presentation influenced phenoconversion: severe bladder symptoms were more common in MSA phenoconverters; subtle motor signs were more frequent in MSA and PD/DLB phenoconverters. MSA phenoconverters were more likely to have higher supine norepinephrine levels and preganglionic pattern of anhidrosis. Presentation variables predicting MSA phenoconversion included subtle motor signs, supine norepinephrine levels, severe bladder symptoms, and dream enactment behavior. Presentation variables predictive of PD/DLB phenoconversion included subtle motor signs, dream enactment behavior, and constipation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that at least a quarter of patients with PAF phenoconvert to MSA, PD, or DLB. Presentation features determine patients at risk for evolution with specific patterns indicative of phenoconversion to MSA vs PD/DLB.

EPVS have been linked to small vessel disease. Some studies have also indicated an association of EPVS to neuroinflammation and/or neurodegeneration. However, there is conflicting evidence with regards to their potential as a clinically relevant imaging biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of EPVS as visualized by MRI in MS. Nine out of 299 original studies addressing EPVS in humans using MRI were eligible for the systematic review and meta-analysis including a total of 457 MS patients and 352 control subjects.
RESULTS: In MS, EPVS have been associated with cognitive decline, contrast-enhancing MRI lesions, and brain atrophy. Yet, these associations were not consistent between studies. The meta-analysis revealed that MS patients have greater EPVS prevalence (odds ratio = 4.61, 95% CI = [1.84; 11.60], p = 0.001) as well as higher EPVS counts (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.46, 95% CI = [0.26; 0.67], p < 0.001) and larger volumes (SMD = 0.88, 95% CI = [0.19; 1.56], p = 0.01) compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Available literature suggests a higher EPVS burden in MS patients compared to controls. The association of EPVS to neuroinflammatory or -degenerative pathology in MS remains inconsistent. Thus, there is currently insufficient evidence supporting EPVS as diagnostic and/or prognostic marker in MS.

The long-term consequences of both abnormalities are difficult to disentangle. We aimed to determine if supine hypertension is associated with target organ damage and worse survival in patients with nOH.
METHODS: Patients with nOH due to multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson disease (PD), or pure autonomic failure (PAF) were classified into those with or without supine hypertension (systolic BP of at least 140 mmHg or diastolic BP of at least 90 mmHg). Organ damage was assessed by measuring cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and renal function. We prospectively followed patients for 30 months (range: 12-66 months) and recorded incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (35 with probable MSA, 14 with PD and 8 with PAF) completed all evaluations. In addition to nOH (average fall 35 ± 21/17 ± 14 mmHg, systolic/diastolic, mean ± SD), 38 patients (67%) had supine hypertension (systolic BP > 140 mmHg). Compared to those without hypertension, patients with hypertension had higher blood urea nitrogen levels (P = 0.005), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.008), higher prevalence of LVH (P = 0.040), and higher WMH volume (P = 0.019). Longitudinal follow-up of patients for over 2 years (27.1 ± 14.5 months) showed that supine hypertension was independently associated with earlier incidence of cardiovascular events and death (HR = 0.25; P = 0.039).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between hospitalization-required infections or sepsis and risk of clinically diagnosed α-synucleinopathies.
METHODS: Using the medical records-linkage system (Rochester Epidemiology Project), we identified all α-synucleinopathy cases of in Olmsted County (1991-2010). Cases were matched by symptom-onset age and sex to controls. We reviewed complete medical records to detect hospital-required infections or sepsis preceding clinical-motor onset of α-synucleinopathies. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio of all α-synucleinopathies, adjusting for medications, coffee, and smoking.

Other disorders can mimic MSA, but it is unknown whether cerebrovascular pathology, so-called ""vascular parkinsonism,"" can mimic MSA. This study aimed to determine the clinicopathological features and red flags for vascular parkinsonism masquerading as MSA.
METHODS: Using a brain bank database, we screened 270 patients with an antemortem diagnosis of MSA, who did not have pathologic evidence of MSA, but rather cerebrovascular pathology, including leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, and microinfarcts. Histologic sections from the neocortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum were reviewed. Medical records were reviewed to characterize the clinical features. The probability of a clinical diagnosis of MSA was assigned retrospectively, guided by current consensus criteria.
RESULTS: Four patients had cerebrovascular pathology without neurodegenerative processes. Chronic ischemic changes in periventricular white matter, subcortical leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, or microinfarcts were detected in basal ganglia of all patients. Cerebrovascular pathology that might contribute to autonomic failure was not identified. Clinically, two patients were diagnosed with possible MSA-parkinsonism, one with probable MSA-parkinsonism, and one with possible MSA-cerebellar type; however, they also had one or more non-supporting features of MSA (e.g., onset >75-years of age, dementia), vascular risk factors, and other etiologies (e.g., autonomic neuropathy) that could cause autonomic failure.

Cancer cells digest the extracellular matrix (ECM) by the release of proteolytic enzymes. The disintegration of matrix ground substance activates several deposited growth factors which stimulate cell proliferation. Stromal (mainly fibroblasts), immune and cancer cells dominate in this area and become involved in a network of multimodal interactions which significantly induce proliferation of colon cancer cells, inhibit their apoptosis and promote their spreading within the local tumour microenvironment. Cancer invasion destroys nerve fibres and neurons of the local enteric nervous system (ENS) and induces subsequent atrophy of the submucosal and myenteric plexuses in areas adjacent to the cancer boundary. Interestingly, the reduction of plexuses' size is accompanied by the increased number of galanin-immunoreactive neurons and increased galanin content in parts of the colon located close to the tumour. Galanin, a neuroprotective peptide, may inhibit the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and in this way promote cancer cell survival. The possible role of acetylcholine and some ENS neuropeptides was also discussed. Invasion of cancer cells spreads along nerve fibres with the involvement of locally-released neutrophins which promote, via their specific receptors, cancer cell proliferation and pro-survival signalling pathways. Thus, during CRC development cancer cells and neurons of the ENS release many neurotransmitters/neuropeptides which affect key cellular signalling pathways promoting cancer cell proliferation and pro-survival phenotype. The multiple interactions between ENS neurons, cancer cells and other cell types present in the colon wall increase cancer cell invasiveness and have a negative impact on the course of CRC.","2020",,"Int J Mol Sci",," review","Animals, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Colorectal Neoplasms, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Disease Progression, FALSE, Enteric Nervous System, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Feedback, Physiological, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Myenteric Plexus, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Neoplasm Invasiveness, FALSE, Tumor Microenvironment, FALSE, immunology, Q000276",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) have been shown to be critical to PC function and survival. However, how PDGFR-mediated PC activity affects vascular homeostasis is not fully understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that imatinib, a chemotherapeutic agent and a potent PDGFR inhibitor, alters PC distribution and thus induces vascular atrophy. We performed a morphometric analysis of the vascular elements in sham control and imatinib-treated NG2-DsRed mice. Vascular morphology and the integrity of the blood-retina barrier (BRB) were evaluated using blood albumin labeling. We found that imatinib decreased the number of PCs and blood vessel (BV) coverage in all retinal vascular layers; this was accompanied by a shrinkage of BV diameters. Surprisingly, the total length of capillaries was not altered, suggesting a preferential effect of imatinib on PCs. Furthermore, blood-retina barrier disruption was not evident.

However, when using another affective ToM task (Eyes Test), MSA group had poorer performance than healthy subjects and Parkinsonian patients, whereas Parkinsonian patients had similar performance to healthy subjects. Regression analysis revealed an association between poor cognitive flexibility and dysfunctional cognitive component of Theory of Mind. Deficit of cognitive and affective components of Theory of Mind occurred in MSA. Dysfunction of cognitive component was related to executive dysfunction (i.e. cognitive rigidity).

METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients with a clinical diagnosis of MSA evaluated at least once a year during the disease course. Type of onset was defined by the first reported motor or autonomic symptom/sign related to MSA. The occurrence of symptoms/signs and milestone of disease progression, and their latency from disease onset, were collected. Survival data were calculated. RBD was confirmed by video-polysomnography.
RESULTS: Of a total of 158 patients, pre-RBD represented the mode of disease onset in 27% of patients, preceding disease onset according to the international criteria with a median of 3 (2-5) years. Comparing pre-RBD and post-RBD patients, the first group showed an increased prevalence of autonomic onset of disease, a reduced prevalence of parkinsonism, an earlier onset of stridor, pyramidal signs, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction, severe dysphagia, and wheelchair dependency. The risk of death was higher in patients with pre-RBD.
CONCLUSIONS: In our MSA cohort, RBD represented the most frequent mode of disease presentation. A more rapid progression of disease was observed in the pre-RBD group.

Seventeen of the 32 (53.1%) patients had OH, with eight of them exhibiting OH symptoms, which were related to the absolute BP value at 60° tilt. However, OH symptoms were not related to the degree of decrease in BP during the tilt test, and they were frequently observed in patients with a mean BP of <80 mmHg at 60° tilt (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 91%).

LBD sometimes coexists with MSA, but the impact of co-pathology, particularly diffuse LBD, on presentation of MSA has not been studied. We aimed to determine the frequency and clinicopathologic features of MSA with LBD (MSA+LBD).
METHODS: Using hematoxylin & eosin and α-synuclein-immunostained slides, we assessed the distribution and severity of LBD in 230 autopsy-confirmed MSA patients collected from 1998 to 2018. Alzheimer-type pathology was assessed to assign the likelihood of clinical presentations of dementia with Lewy body (DLB) using the consensus criteria for DLB. We reviewed medical records to characterize clinicopathologic features of MSA+LBD. Genetic risk factors for LBD, including APOE ε4 allele and mutations in GBA, SNCA, LRRK2, and VPS35, were analyzed.
RESULTS: LBD was observed in 11 MSA patients (5%); seven were brainstem type, three were transitional type, and one was diffuse type. The latter four had an intermediate or high likelihood of DLB. Three of the four had an antemortem diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) or clinically probable DLB. Two patients had neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, but not in striatal or olivocerebellar systems with widespread glial cytoplasmic inclusions, consistent with minimal change MSA. In these cases, LBD was considered the primary pathology, and MSA was considered coincidental. APOE ε4 allele frequency was not different between MSA+LBD and MSA without LBD. Two of nine MSA+LBD patients had a risk variant of GBA (p.T408M and p.E365K).

Biomarker studies in iRBD are relevant due to lack of evidence in this condition. The identification of biomarkers able to predict progression to synucleinopathy diseases is critical for iRBD. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging might provide information about ongoing neurodegenerative processes. In the present study, we tested for presence of brain hypometabolism patterns as biomarkers of neurodegeneration in single iRBD individuals.
METHODS: We recruited 37 subjects with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD, with neuropsychological assessment and available FDG-PET scan. Images were analysed with a validated statistical parametric mapping procedure, providing individual hypometabolism maps.
RESULTS: According to the neuropsychological evaluation, 22 subjects with iRBD had normal cognition and 15 subjects showed impairments, particularly in visuoperceptive/visuospatial and memory domains. One-fifth of the cases were impaired on the Qualitative Scoring of Pentagon Test. In 32 iRBD cases, FDG-PET statistical parametric maps revealed significant cerebral hypometabolism, namely in the occipital lobes (n = 5), occipital and cerebellar regions (n = 13), occipitoparietal regions (n = 13) and a selective cerebellar hypometabolism (n = 1). Five cases had normal FDG-PET scans.
CONCLUSIONS: These imaging findings indicate that brain neurodegenerative processes are present and already detectable in iRBD. The different hypometabolism patterns in the single individuals may reflect specific early pathophysiological events due to the underlying synucleinopathy, with a specific neural vulnerability for the occipital cortex that might pre-date a risk of progression towards dementia with Lewy body.","2020",,"Eur J Neurol","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder ( iRBD ) is a parasomnia , recently recognized as a risk factor for progression to Parkinson's disease , dementia with Lewy body and multiple system atrophy ","other","Brain, FALSE, Fluorodeoxyglucose F18, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Positron-Emission Tomography, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in patients who were diagnosed with MSA and underwent urodynamic studies simultaneously from September 2014 to July 2018. The urodynamic traces were reviewed by urologists. Detrusor contractility was evaluated by the bladder contractility index (BCI) and Schäfer nomogram. Telephone follow-up was conducted in July 2019 to acquire survival data. Clinical and urodynamic parameters were analyzed for survival using Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 70 MSA patients were eligible for analysis, and 61 of them underwent urodynamic study within 3 years of initial symptom onset. The parkinsonian subtype of MSA (MSA-P) had a smaller proportion of men as well as longer motor and lower urinary tract symptom durations than the cerebellar subtype (MSA-C). MSA-P also had a lower mean BCI than MSA-C (32.0 ± 27.0 versus 53.6 ± 33.4, p = 0.025). The mean MSA survival time was 5.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8-6.3] years. Cox regression analysis showed that survival from baseline was correlated only with BCI [hazard ratio (HR) 0.983, 95% CI 0.969-0.997, p = 0.020]. Overall survival was correlated with BCI (HR 0.982, 95% CI 0.966-0.999, p = 0.039) and the presence of urinary incontinence (HR 3.007, 95% CI 0.993-9.220, p = 0.052).

To validate previous reports, we investigated the prevalence of neuropsychological dysfunction in persons with celiac disease included in the National UK Biobank, which contains experimental medical data from 500,000 adults in the United Kingdom.
METHODS: Biobank participants with celiac disease (n = 104; mean age, 63 years; 65% female) were matched with healthy individuals (controls, n = 198; mean age, 63 years; 67% female) for age, sex, level of education, body mass index, and diagnosis of hypertension. All participants were otherwise healthy. We compared scores from 5 cognitive tests and multiple choice responses to 6 questions about mental health between groups using the t test and chi-squared analyses. Groupwise analyses of magnetic resonance imaging brain data included a study of diffusion tensor imaging metrics (mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity), voxel-based morphometry, and Mann-Whitney U comparisons of Fazekas grades.
RESULTS: Compared with control individuals, participants with celiac disease had significant deficits in reaction time (P = .004), and significantly higher proportions had indications of anxiety (P = .025), depression (P = .015), thoughts of self-harm (P = .025), and health-related unhappiness (P = .010).

We used joint models to evaluate the risk of death, the mean trajectory of each UMSARS subscale and to determine the potential factors. Investigated factors included gender, age at baseline, MSA subtype, diagnosis certainty, type of first symptoms and the duration between symptom onset and the first visit. Among the 261 MSA patients included in our cohort, the median duration of clinical follow-up was 2.1 years (up to 10.3 years) and the median survival was 4.0 years since the first visit. Main factors for poor survival were the progression over time of UMSARS score (I + II and IV) and the severity of orthostatic hypotension. MSA subtype had no effect on progression or survival. The UMSARS I + II score progressed faster over time in subjects with autonomic dysfunction as the initial feature and in women. Despite a faster progression, women and men had similar survival.

METHODS: Using the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we identified incident cases of α-synucleinopathies in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1991 to 2010, matching by age (±1 year) at symptom onset and sex to controls. We reviewed records of cases and controls to detect TBI prior to clinical-motor onset of any α-synucleinopathies. We based severity (possible, probable, and definite) upon the Mayo Classification System for TBI Severity. Using conditional-logistic regression, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) of all α-synucleinopathies and type, adjusting for coffee intake and smoking.
RESULTS: TBI frequency was lower among cases (7.0%) than controls (8.2%). No association was found between TBI and all α-synucleinopathies in multivariable analyses (OR 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-1.52). No association presented when examining the number of TBIs, TBI severity, time between TBI exposure and index date, age at index date, or sex.

METHODS: We performed endoscopic screening with esophageal iodine staining and oropharyngolaryngeal inspection in 7582 Japanese alcohol-dependent men (40-79 years) during 1993-2018, and retrospectively investigated their initial screening results.
RESULTS: The 2008-2018 screening showed lower detection rates for ESCC (2.6% vs 4.0%, P = .0009) and GA (0.5% vs 1.4%, P < .0001) for all age brackets, compared with the 1993-2007 screening. The HNSCC detection rate did not change (1.0% vs 1.1%). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the 2008-2018 screening had a reduced OR (95% CI) for ESCC (0.34 [0.25-0.47]) and GA (0.19 [0.10-0.35]), compared with the 1993-2007 screening. The reduction in H pylori infection is probably the main reason for the decrease in GA detection over time. Declining trends in pack-years and gastric atrophy and increasing trends in age and body mass index (BMI) were found over time. The presence of advanced gastric atrophy increased the risk for ESCC as well as GA. The inactive heterozygous aldehyde dehydrogenase-2*1/*2 genotype was a strong risk factor for ESCC, HNSCC, and GA.

The risks of these events cooccurring with either MSA-C or MSA-P were compared.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed clinical outcomes only of patients with MSA who presented at the Department of Otolaryngology of the University of Tokyo Hospital between 2008 and 2018. The proportion and timing of onset events between MSA-C and MSA-P and risks of onset were compared using chi-square tests and Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, and disease severity, respectively.
RESULTS: We identified 113 patients (median age: 60 years, 72 men [64%]). The frequency and timing of VFMI, SA, MV, dysphagia, and surgeries were 55 patients (49%) and 76 (95% CI 61-91) months after MSA onset, 85 (75%) and 41 (32-50), 36 (32%) and 100 (73-127), 77 (68%) and 43 (36-50), and 25 (22%) and 102 (84-120), respectively.

Previous reports have described a high risk for neurodegeneration in patients with iRBD; however, to date, no published study has analyzed an adequate number of Japanese patients. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders among patients diagnosed with iRBD in our department.
METHODS: The data were retrospectively collected from patients' medical records. The patients included in the study were diagnosed with iRBD using polysomnography in our department, from May 1, 2005 to November 30, 2018, with a follow-up of ≥6 months. Using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, we estimated the incidence of later diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders among this cohort of patients with iRBD.
RESULTS: Among 57 consecutive patients diagnosed with iRBD, 14 (24.6%) were later diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders. Using the KM method, we estimated that the incidence was as high as 18.5% and 68.1% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Of the 14 patients who developed neurodegenerative disorders, 12 (85.7%) had α-synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease in eight patients, Lewy body dementia in three, Alzheimer's-type dementia in two, and multiple system atrophy in one).

They are crucial for the immunity, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, neurotrophic support, phagocytosis of cellular debris, and maintaining the CNS integrity and homeostasis. Invasion by pathogens as well as in CNS injuries and damages results in activation of microglia known as microgliosis. The activated microglia have the capacity to release proinflammatory mediators leading to neuroinflammation. However, uncontrolled neuroinflammation can give rise to various neurological disorders (NDs), especially the neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and stroke. Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are among the most widely prescribed medications for the management of hypercholesterolemia worldwide. It can be used for primary prevention in healthy individuals who are at higher risk of cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases as well as the secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases disease. A growing body of evidence has indicated that statins have the potential to attenuate the proinflammatory mediators and subsequent NDs by controlling the microglial activation and consequent reduction in neuroinflammatory mediators.

Stridor may also occur and it is associated with life-threatening events and poor prognosis. The pathophysiology of stridor in MSA is still debated.
OBJECTIVE: To define correlations between diurnal electromyographic (EMG) abnormalities of vocal cord muscles and stridor in MSA phenotypes.
METHODS: We recruited 60 patients with ""probable"" MSA (45 with parkinsonian [MSA-P] and 15 with cerebellar phenotype [MSA-C]). Nocturnal stridor was detected with video-polysomnography, whereas diurnal stridor was clinically noted when present. A diurnal kinesiologic EMG study of the adductor thyroarytenoid and the abductor posterior cricoarytenoid muscles was also performed.
RESULTS: Among subjects with nocturnal stridor, MSA-P patients predominantly showed a paradoxical burst-like activation of the adductor thyroarytenoid muscle during inspiration. This dystonic pattern was associated with nocturnal stridor in MSA-P (odds ratio [OR] = 23.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.42-70.77, p < 0.001). Conversely, MSA-C patients with nocturnal stridor mainly had additional neurogenic findings of vocal cord muscles. This dystonic-plus pattern correlated with nocturnal stridor in MSA-C (OR = 17.21, 95% CI 4.17-74.92, p < 0.01). The findings of diurnal stridor paralleled the observations for nocturnal stridor.

PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe a case of a prolonged febrile syndrome in a 55-year-old female patient with onset of multiple system atrophy two years before presentation. Patient history and symptoms were not contributive to guide the diagnostic work-up.
DIAGNOSIS: Initial evaluation provided no specific findings. Repeat testing of auto-antibodies revealed positive antinuclear and anti-ds DNA antibodies coupled with low complement which in conjunction with renal biopsy substantiated the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus flare.
INTERVENTION: Pending the biopsy result, treatment with hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids was initiated. Due to failure to achieve remission, azathioprine was added, but symptoms persisted. Following the diagnosis of lupus nephritis, azathioprine was discontinued and induction treatment with cyclophosphamide in accordance with the Euro-Lupus regimen was initiated and upon completion followed by maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil.
OUTCOMES: The patient achieved remission after cyclophosphamide was added to treatment with corticosteroids and has not experienced new flares during the next two years. The neurological syndrome has remained stable during this period.

In our study, we validated the additional value of 123I-MIBG scintigraphy beyond providing information on neurological findings and response to dopaminergic therapy for the diagnosis of PDin the early phase.
METHODS: We investigated 77 cases of PD (Hoehn and Yahr Stages I-III) and 73 cases of atypical parkinsonian disorder (APD), including 35 patients with multiple system atrophy, 19 with corticobasal syndrome, and 19 with progressive supranuclear palsy. Two multiple logistic regression models were developed to predict the probability of PD based on APD. Common covariates were resting tremor, vertical supranuclear palsy, apraxia, cerebellar symptoms, and response to dopaminergic therapy with MIBG scintigraphy (reference model) or without it (MIBG-added model). The net reclassification index (NRI) was examined and net benefit using decision curve analysis was performed to examine the additional clinical value of MIBG scintigraphy. Finally, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of MIBG scintigraphy.
RESULTS: The MIBG-added model significantly improved the ability to classify PD or APD compared with the reference model (NRI index 1.390, p < 0.001). However, the decision curve of the reference model ranked equally with the MIBG-added model up to a risk threshold of 0.8. In addition, MIBG scintigraphy was not cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Although MIBG scintigraphy has statistical usefulness for PD diagnosis, there may be little additional benefit in the early phase of PD beyond the neurological findings and response to dopaminergic therapy regarding clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

Severe neuroinflammation develops along with hallmark neuropathological changes, and as in Parkinson's disease, intake of anti-inflammatory medication has been hypothesized to be protective for development of disease. We aimed to investigate if use of non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin, or statins were associated with a reduced risk of MSA.
METHODS: We performed a register-based case-control study in MSA (n = 155) cases and population controls (n= 7,750) matched on age, gender, and place of residency by risk-set sampling. Pharmacological exposure prior to diagnosis was assessed in 2 categories (user vs. nonuser, cumulated dose in tertiles [T1-T3]). In an unconditional logistic regression model, adjusted for age, gender, residency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we estimated ORs and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: Data suggested a trend towards non-aspirin NSAID use to be associated with a decreased risk of MSA (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.49-1.06]) compared to nonusers, decreasing dose-dependently (T2 OR 0.77 [95% CI 0.43-1.38]; T3 OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.29-1.06]). However, data were based on small numbers. Use of statins and low-dose aspirin was not associated with a decreased risk of MSA. Results were lagged 5 years from index date to address reverse causation.

We used Latent Class Analysis (LCA), an innovative statistical approach, to identify profiles of patients based on common clinical characteristics. Brain metabolism of different groups was studied at rest.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were included. Three different profiles were revealed (entropy = 0.835): 1. extrapyramidal, axial, laryngeal-pharyngeal involvement (LPI) and cerebellar symptoms (n = 46, 54.1%); 2. cerebellar and LPI symptoms (n = 30, 35.3%); 3. cerebellar and cognitive symptoms (n = 9, 10.6%).

METHODS: Case description of conjugal MSA with report of shared environmental risk factors and retrospective review of consecutively diagnosed MSA patients between 1998 and 2012 with autonomic reflex screen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester (clinical series). Probability calculation was based on the age-specific point prevalence of MSA.
RESULTS: A husband and wife both developed MSA symptoms at age 63. The husband's onset was of imbalance, followed by falls and genitourinary failure; parkinsonism and antecollis was evident on examination. Autonomic testing showed widespread autonomic failure. The patient died 2.25 years after onset. The wife initially developed urinary symptoms progressing to incontinence. Parkinsonism, dysphonia, and falls began within 1 year. Autonomic testing revealed severe autonomic failure. Interview with the surviving wife and son revealed substantial chemical exposure, in particular pesticides. In our clinical series, there were no other cases of conjugal MSA. Assuming an age-specific point prevalence of MSA based on population studies and independence of the two events, the probability of both individuals developing MSA by chance is 6.08 e-9.

A consensus definition of stridor in MSA is lacking, and disagreement persists about its diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. An International Consensus Conference among experts with methodological support was convened in Bologna in 2017 to define stridor in MSA and to reach consensus statements for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Stridor was defined as a strained, high-pitched, harsh respiratory sound, mainly inspiratory, occurring only during sleep or during both sleep and wakefulness, and caused by laryngeal dysfunction leading to narrowing of the rima glottidis. According to the consensus, stridor may be recognized clinically by the physician if present at the time of examination, with the help of a witness, or by listening to an audio recording. Laryngoscopy is suggested to exclude mechanical lesions or functional vocal cord abnormalities related to different neurologic conditions. If the suspicion of stridor needs confirmation, drug-induced sleep endoscopy or video polysomnography may be useful. The impact of stridor on survival and quality of life remains uncertain. Continuous positive airway pressure and tracheostomy are both suggested as symptomatic treatment of stridor, but whether they improve survival is uncertain.

METHODS: IRB approved review of medical records in patients with cognitive decline focused on those who had documented TBI histories and brain MRI scans after TBI (n = 40, 67.7±14.5 years) with volumetric quantification by applying an FDA cleared software program. TBI documentation included head trauma mechanism. Brain volumes were compared to a normative database to determine the extent of atrophy. Correlations between these regions and global tests of cognition (MMSE in n = 17, MoCA in n = 27, n = 14 in both) were performed.
RESULTS: Multiple regions demonstrated volume loss in TBI, particularly ventral diencephalon, putamen, and pallidum with smaller magnitude of atrophy in temporal lobes and brainstem. Lobar structures showed strongest correlations between atrophy and lower scores on MMSE and MoCA. The hippocampus, while correlated to tests of cognitive function, was the least atrophic region as a function of TBI history.
CONCLUSION: Persons with TBI history exhibit show regional brain atrophy. Several of these areas, such as thalamus and temporal lobes, also correlate with cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease atrophy was less likely given relative sparing of the hippocampi. Volumetric quantification of brain MRI in TBI warrants further investigation to further determine its clinical potential in TBI and differentiating causes of cognitive impairment.","2019",,"J Alzheimers Dis"," OBJECTIVE : To characterize regional brain volume loss in persons with TBI presenting with cognitive impairment ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Brain Injuries, Traumatic, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Organ Size, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Although certain cardinal features of parkinsonism, including bradykinesia and rigidity, respond well to levodopa, axial features, such as gait and balance impairment, are less reliably responsive to dopaminergic therapy and surgical interventions. Consequently, falls are common in PD and other synucleinopathies and are a major contributor toward injury and loss of independence. This underscores the need for appropriate fall risk assessment and implementation of preventative measures in all patients with parkinsonism.

Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of α-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of α-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system, we identified all persons residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, who received a diagnostic code of parkinsonism from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2010. A movement disorder specialist reviewed the complete medical records of each individual to confirm the presence of parkinsonism, determine the type of synucleinopathy, and identify the onset dates of each cardinal symptom (tremor at rest, bradykinesia, rigidity, and impaired postural reflexes). We determined the median time from age at diagnosis to death or censoring (June 30, 2015) for each presenting symptom and the age- and sex-adjusted risk of death.
RESULTS: From 1991 through 2010, a total of 433 individuals had a synucleinopathy diagnosed (301 [69.5%], Parkinson disease; 68 [15.7%], dementia with Lewy bodies; 52 [12.0%], Parkinson disease dementia; and 12 [2.8%], multiple systems atrophy with parkinsonism). Overall, the risk of death in the tremor-predominant group was less than that in the bradykinesia/rigidity-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.87; P=.007). Similarly, risk of death in the bradykinesia/rigidity-only group was significantly greater than in the tremor-predominant group (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.23-2.51; P=.002) and compared with tremor before bradykinesia (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.24-2.47; P=.001).

MSA is characterized by deposition of fibrillar α-synuclein (α-syn) in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in oligodendrocytes. Similar to other synucleinopathies, α-syn self-assembly is thought to be a key pathologic event and a prominent target for disease modification in MSA. Molecular tweezers are broad-spectrum nanochaperones that prevent formation of toxic protein assemblies and enhance their clearance. The current lead compound, CLR01, has been shown to inhibit α-syn aggregation but has not yet been tested in the context of MSA. To fill this gap, here, we conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the efficacy of CLR01 in remodeling MSA-like α-syn pathology in the PLP-α-syn mouse model of MSA. Six-month-old mice received intracerebroventricular CLR01 (0.3 or 1 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for 32 days. Open-field test revealed a significant, dose-dependent amelioration of an anxiety-like phenotype. Subsequently, immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses showed dose-dependent reduction of pathological and seeding-competent forms of α-syn, which correlated with the behavioral phenotype. CLR01 treatment also promoted dopaminergic neuron survival in the substantia nigra. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an agent that reduces formation of putative high-molecular-weight oligomers and seeding-competent α-syn in a mouse model of MSA, supporting the view that these species are key to the neurodegenerative process and its cell-to-cell progression in MSA.

Though genetic studies have identified variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, no variants have been consistently associated with multiple sclerosis severity. In part, the lack of findings is related to inherent limitations of clinical rating scales; these scales are insensitive to early degenerative changes that underlie disease progression. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina and low-contrast letter acuity correlate with and predict clinical and imaging-based outcomes in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, they may serve as sensitive phenotypes to discover genetic predictors of disease course. We conducted a set of genome-wide association studies of longitudinal structural and functional visual pathway phenotypes in multiple sclerosis. First, we assessed genetic predictors of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy in a discovery cohort of 374 patients with multiple sclerosis using mixed-effects models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, optic neuritis and genetic ancestry and using a combination of single-variant and network-based analyses. For candidate variants identified in discovery, we conducted a similar set of analyses of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer thinning in a replication cohort (n = 376). Second, we assessed genetic predictors of sustained loss of 5-letters in low-contrast letter acuity in discovery (n = 582) using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We then evaluated candidate variants/pathways in a replication cohort. (n = 253). Results of both studies revealed novel subnetworks highly enriched for connected genes in early complement activation linked to measures of disease severity. Within these networks, C3 was the gene most strongly associated with ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy (P = 0.004) and C1QA and CR1 were top results in analysis of sustained low-contrast letter acuity loss. Namely, variant rs158772, linked to C1QA, and rs61822967, linked to CR1, were associated with 71% and 40% increases in risk of sustained LCLA loss, respectively, in meta-analysis pooling discovery and replication cohorts (rs158772: hazard ratio: 1.71; 95% confidence interval 1.30-2.25; P = 1.3 × 10-4; rs61822967: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.68; P = 4.1 × 10-4).

The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) are stress-activated kinases with multiple substrates including c-Jun, which can be activated during neuronal injury and neurodegenerative disease leading to neuronal apoptosis. Recently, increased JNK-c-Jun signaling was reported in SMA raising the possibility that JNK inhibitors could be a novel treatment for this disease. We examined JNK-c-Jun activity in SMA mouse and human cultured cells and tissues. Anisomycin treatment of human SMA fibroblasts and sciatic nerve ligation in SMA mice provoked robust phosphorylated-c-Jun (p-c-Jun) expression indicating that SMN-deficiency does not prevent activation of the stress-induced JNK-c-Jun signaling pathway. Despite retained capacity to activate JNK-c-Jun, we observed no basal increase of p-c-Jun levels in SMA compared to control cultured cells, human or mouse spinal cord tissues, or mouse MNs during the period of MN loss in severe SMA model mice. In both controls and SMA, ~50% of α-MN nuclei express p-c-Jun with decreasing expression during the early postnatal period.

The process(es) underlying LB generation and its causal trigger molecules are not yet fully understood. α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of LB and SNCA gene missense mutations or duplications/triplications are causal for rare hereditary forms of PD. As typical sporadic PD is associated with LB pathology, a factor of major importance is the study of the α-syn protein and its pathology. α-Syn pathology is, however, also evident in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Lewy body disease (LBD), making it non-specific for PD. In addition, there is an overlap of these α-synucleinopathies with other protein-misfolding diseases. It has been proven that α-syn, phosphorylated tau protein (pτ), amyloid beta (Aβ) and other proteins show synergistic effects in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Multiple cell death mechanisms can induce pathological protein-cascades, but this can also be a reverse process. This holds true for the early phases of the disease process and especially for the progression of PD. In conclusion, while rare SNCA gene mutations are causal for a minority of familial PD patients, in sporadic PD (where common SNCA polymorphisms are the most consistent genetic risk factor across populations worldwide, accounting for 95% of PD patients) α-syn pathology is an important feature. Conversely, with regard to the etiopathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies PD, MSA and LBD, α-syn is rather a bystander contributing to multiple neurodegenerative processes, which overlap in their composition and individual strength.

However, accumulating evidence suggests that the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (αSyn), mainly associated with synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), is involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Lewy-related pathology (LRP), primarily comprised of αSyn, is present in a majority of autopsied AD brains, and higher levels of αSyn in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD have been linked to cognitive decline. Recent studies also suggest that the asymptomatic accumulation of Aβ plaques is associated with higher CSF αSyn levels in subjects at risk of sporadic AD and in individuals carrying autosomal dominant AD mutations. Experimental evidence has further linked αSyn mainly to tau hyperphosphorylation, but also to the pathological actions of Aβ and the APOEε4 allele, the latter being a major genetic risk factor for both AD and DLB. In this review, we provide a summary of the current evidence proposing an involvement of αSyn either as an active or passive player in the pathophysiological ensemble of AD, and furthermore describe in detail the current knowledge of αSyn structure and inferred function.","2019",,"Mol Neurodegener",," review","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Plaque, Amyloid, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, tau Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Recent genome analyses have revealed that mutation in MOBP is a risk factor for various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), tauopathies and transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa proteinopathies. Proteomics analysis has shown that MOBP is a component of cortical Lewy bodies (LBs). However, the immunohistochemical localization of MOBP in the human brain is not known. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the brain, spinal cord and peripheral ganglia from patients with various neurodegenerative diseases and control subjects. In normal controls, MOBP immunoreactivity was evident in the myelin in the central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), and neuronal cytoplasm in both the central and PNS. In Parkinson's disease and dementia with LBs, MOBP immunoreactivity was found in the core of LBs in the brainstem, cingulate cortex and sympathetic ganglia. No MOBP immunoreactivity was found in a variety of other neuronal or glial inclusions in other disorders, including multiple system atrophy, AD, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

METHODS: We searched PubMed (January 2007-February 2019) for human studies of OH and RBD evaluating cognitive impairment, postural instability, and survival in Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (PAF). Included studies were analysed for design, key results and limitations as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
RESULTS: OH and RBD showed a positive association with cognitive impairment in PD and DLB, conflicting association in PAF, and no association in MSA. OH was correlated with incident falls and postural instability in PD and DLB but not in MSA. The association between RBD and postural instability was inconclusive; positive in five studies, negative in seven. OH, but not RBD, correlated with reduced survival in PD, DLB and MSA. The combination of OH and RBD was associated with cognitive impairment and more rapid progression of postural instability.

A systolic BP drop of ≥20 mmHg (or ≥10 mmHg diastolic) upon standing with little or no compensatory increase in heart rate is consistent with nOH. Symptoms of nOH include light-headedness, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope; these symptoms can severely impact patients' activities of daily living and increase the likelihood of potentially dangerous falls. Because of their patient contact, nurses and nurse practitioners can play a key role in identifying and evaluating patients at risk for nOH. It is advisable to screen for nOH in patients presenting with one or more of the following characteristics: those who have disorders associated with autonomic failure, those with episodes of falls or syncope, those with symptoms upon standing, those who are elderly or frail, or those taking multiple medications. Initial evaluations should include questions about postural symptoms and measurement of orthostatic BP and heart rate. A review of medications for potential agents that can have hypotensive effects should be performed before initiating treatment. Treatment for nOH may include non-pharmacologic measures and pharmacologic therapy. Droxidopa and midodrine are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic nOH and symptomatic OH, respectively. nOH is associated with the coexistence of supine hypertension, and the two disorders must be carefully managed.

What happens if background EMF rise to critical levels, coinciding with increasing environmental pollutants? Two of the authors can look back over 50 clinical years and appreciate the profound changes in human morbidity across a range of disparate conditions - autoimmune diseases, asthma, earlier cancer incidence and reduced male sperm counts. In particular have been increased autism, dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and neurological diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Early Onset Dementia, Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. What might have caused these changes-whilst genetic factors are taken as given, multiple environmental pollutants are associated with neurological disease although the mechanisms are unclear. The pace of increased neurological deaths far exceeds any Gompertzian explanation - that because people are living longer they are more likely to develop more age-related problems such as neurological disease. Using WHO global mortality categories of Neurological Disease Deaths (NDD) and Alzheimer's and Dementia deaths (Alz), updated June 2018, together they constitute Total Neurological Mortality (TNM), to calculate mortality rates per million for people aged 55-74 and for the over-75's in twenty-one Western countries. Recent increases in American people aged over-75's rose 49% from 1989 to 2015 but US neurological deaths increased five-fold. In 1989 based on Age-Standardised-Deaths-Rates America USA was 17th at 324 pm but rising to 539 pm became second highest. Different environmental/occupational factors have been found to be associated with neuro-degenerative diseases, including background EMF. We briefly explore how levels of EMF interact upon the human body, which can be described as a natural antennae and provide new evidence that builds upon earlier research to propose the following hypothesis. Based upon recent and new evidence we hypothesise that a major contribution for the relative sudden upsurge in neurological morbidity in the Western world (1989-2015), is because of increased background EMF that has become the tipping point-impacting upon any genetic predisposition, increasing multiple-interactive pollutants, such as rises in petro-chemicals, hormone disrupting chemicals, industrial, agricultural and domestic chemicals. The unprecedented neurological death rates, all within just twenty-five years, demand a re-examination of long-term EMF safety related to the increasing background EMF on human health.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition. The classic motor symptoms of PD may be preceded by many non-motor symptoms (NMS), which include hyposmia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, constipation, cognitive impairment, and depression. Population studies have identified mutations in GBA1 as the main risk factor for idiopathic PD. The present study sought to evaluate the prevalence of NMS in a cohort of patients with GD type 1 from Southern Brazil.
METHODOLOGY: This is an observational, cross-sectional study, with a convenience sampling strategy. Cognition was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCa), daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Scale, depression by the Beck Inventory, constipation by the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale, and REM sleep behavior disorder by the Single-Question Screen; hyposmia by the Sniffin' Sticks. Motor symptoms were assessed with part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. All patients were also genotyped for the GBA1 3'-UTR SNP (rs708606).
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (female = 13; on enzyme replacement therapy = 21, substrate reduction therapy = 2) with a mean age of 41.45 ± 15.3 years (range, 22-67) were included. Eight patients were found to be heterozygous for the 3'-UTR SNP (rs708606). Fourteen patients (8 over age 40 years) presented at least one NMS; daytime sleepiness was the most frequent (n = 10). Two patients (aged 63 and 64, respectively) also presented motor symptoms, probably drug-related.

Although varying in prevalence, symptom patterns, and severity among disorders, all α-synucleinopathies have in common autonomic nervous system dysfunctions, which reduce quality of life. Frequent symptoms among α-synucleinopathies include constipation, urinary and sexual dysfunction, and cardiovascular autonomic symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, and reduced heart rate variability. Symptoms due to autonomic dysfunction can appear before motor symptom onset, particularly in MSA and PD, hence, detection and quantitative analysis of these symptoms can enable early diagnosis and initiation of treatment, as well as identification of at-risk populations. While patients with PD, DLB, and MSA show both central and peripheral nervous system involvement of α-synuclein pathology, pure autonomic failure (PAF) is a condition characterized by generalized dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system with neuronal cytoplasmic α-synuclein inclusions in the peripheral autonomic small nerve fibers. Patients with PAF often present with orthostatic hypotension, reduced heart rate variability, anhydrosis, erectile dysfunction, and constipation, without motor or cognitive impairment. These patients also have an increased risk of developing an α-synucleinopathy with central involvement, such as PD, DLB, or MSA in later life, possibly indicating a pathophysiological disease continuum.

These findings represent a paradigm shift for the physiological function of axon-associated glia, and open the intriguing possibility that oligodendrocytes are important contributors to neurodegenerative diseases in which myelinated axons are lost, such as in Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple system atrophy.

Among 122 lesion changes identified, the most common changes were enlargement of diffuse atrophy (n = 50, 41.0%), appearance of lacquer cracks (n = 28, 23.0%), enlargement of patchy atrophy (n = 10, 8.2%) and development of additional lacquer cracks (n = 7, 5.8%). In addition, we identified 1 eye with enlargement of a Fuch's spot, and 1 eye with active choroidal neovascularization. In multiple logistic regression analysis, myopic maculopathy progression was associated with older age, longer axial length, greater change in myopic spherical equivalent and more severe myopic maculopathy at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Myopic maculopathy progressed in approximately 15% of highly myopic eyes over a 2-year period.

We aimed to explore the frequency of drooling and its relationship to clinical features in a relatively large cohort of Chinese patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA).
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 143 patients with MSA. Patients with drooling were identified as those with a score ≥ 1 on item 6 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Additional scales were used to rate daily functionality, neurologic and cognitive capabilities, levels of anxiety and depression, and sleep quality. These results were compared between patients with and without drooling.
RESULTS: The frequency of drooling in this cohort was 59.4% (85/143). Drooling was associated with significantly poorer scores on the Unified MSA Rating Scale (subscore I, subscore II, subscore IV, total score), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination. After adjusting for confounders, regression analysis identified two independent risk factors for drooling: parkinsonism-associated MSA (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.15-5.65) and hypomimia (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.32-7.68).

Multiple pathological factors such as severe neuron loss, induction of inhibitory molecules, and insufficient regeneration are responsible for the poor functional recovery. Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing Nogo receptor-interacting protein 1 (LINGO-1), a central nervous system (CNS)-specific transmembrane protein that is selectively expressed on neurons and oligodendrocytes, serves as a potent negative mediator of axonal regeneration and myelination in CNS injuries and diseases. Although accumulating evidence has demonstrated improvement in axonal regeneration and neurological functions by LINGO-1 antagonism in CNS damage, the possible effects of LINGO-1 in spinal root avulsion remain undiscovered. In this study, a LINGO-1 knockdown strategy using lentiviral vectors encoding LINGO-1 short hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) delivered by the Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) hydrogel was described after brachial plexus avulsion (BPA). We provide evidence that following BPA and immediate reimplantation, transplantation of LINGO-1 shRNA lentiviral vectors encapsulated by PF-127 rescued the injured motoneurons, enhanced axonal outgrowth and myelination, rebuilt motor endplates, facilitated the reinnervation of terminal muscles, improved angiogenesis, and promoted recovery of avulsed forelimbs. Altogether, these data suggest that delivery of LINGO-1 shRNA by a gel scaffold is a potential therapeutic approach for root avulsion. Impact Statement In this study, we attempted transplantation of lentivirus (LV)/leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing Nogo receptor-interacting protein 1 (LINGO-1)-short hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) encapsulated by the Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) hydrogel into a brachial plexus avulsion (BPA)-reimplantation model. We found that administration of LV/LINGO-1 shRNA facilitates neuron survival and axonal regeneration, attenuates muscle atrophy and motor endplate (MEP) loss, enhances neovascularization, and promotes functional recovery in BPA rats. Co-transplantation of LV/LINGO-1 shRNA and gel reinforces the survival-promoting effect, axonal outgrowth, and angiogenesis in comparison with LV/LINGO-1 shRNA application alone. Our research provides evidence that LV /LINGO-1 shRNA delivered by PF-127 represents a new treatment strategy for BPA repair.","2019",,"Tissue Eng Part A",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Axons, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Brachial Plexus, FALSE, injuries, Q000293, Cell Survival, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gene Transfer Techniques, FALSE, Lentivirus, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Membrane Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Motor Endplate, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Motor Neurons, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Muscular Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Myelin Sheath, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Neovascularization, Physiologic, FALSE, Nerve Regeneration, FALSE, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Poloxamer, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, RNA, Small Interfering, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Recovery of Function, TRUE, Spinal Nerve Roots, FALSE, injuries, Q000293",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

This provides an unprecedented opportunity to directly observe prodromal neurodegenerative states, and potentially intervene with neuroprotective therapy. For future neuroprotective trials, it is essential to accurately estimate phenoconversion rate and identify potential predictors of phenoconversion. This study assessed the neurodegenerative disease risk and predictors of neurodegeneration in a large multicentre cohort of iRBD. We combined prospective follow-up data from 24 centres of the International RBD Study Group. At baseline, patients with polysomnographically-confirmed iRBD without parkinsonism or dementia underwent sleep, motor, cognitive, autonomic and special sensory testing. Patients were then prospectively followed, during which risk of dementia and parkinsonsim were assessed. The risk of dementia and parkinsonism was estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Predictors of phenoconversion were assessed with Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for age, sex, and centre. Sample size estimates for disease-modifying trials were calculated using a time-to-event analysis. Overall, 1280 patients were recruited. The average age was 66.3 ± 8.4 and 82.5% were male. Average follow-up was 4.6 years (range = 1-19 years). The overall conversion rate from iRBD to an overt neurodegenerative syndrome was 6.3% per year, with 73.5% converting after 12-year follow-up. The rate of phenoconversion was significantly increased with abnormal quantitative motor testing [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.16], objective motor examination (HR = 3.03), olfactory deficit (HR = 2.62), mild cognitive impairment (HR = 1.91-2.37), erectile dysfunction (HR = 2.13), motor symptoms (HR = 2.11), an abnormal DAT scan (HR = 1.98), colour vision abnormalities (HR = 1.69), constipation (HR = 1.67), REM atonia loss (HR = 1.54), and age (HR = 1.54). There was no significant predictive value of sex, daytime somnolence, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnoea, urinary dysfunction, orthostatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, or hyperechogenicity on substantia nigra ultrasound. Among predictive markers, only cognitive variables were different at baseline between those converting to primary dementia versus parkinsonism. Sample size estimates for definitive neuroprotective trials ranged from 142 to 366 patients per arm. This large multicentre study documents the high phenoconversion rate from iRBD to an overt neurodegenerative syndrome.

This brief review updates our understanding of the templated spread of α-syn pathology in neurodegenerative disease from the perspective of proteopathic α-syn seeds, including how these seeds are processed by cells as well as their effects on cellular function. Recent advances in understanding the conformations of α-syn seeds are highlighted, and the possible structural basis for the observed heterogeneity of synucleinopathies is discussed.

OBJECTIVES/AIMS: To characterize clinical, neuroimaging, and psycho-neuro-immunological associations with NLR and MLR in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: We identified a large cohort of clinically well-defined patients from our longitudinal database that included MS-related outcomes, disease-modifying therapy, patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, and quantified cerebral MRI at 1.5 T. We queried hospital records for complete blood counts within 2 months of each clinic visit and excluded those obtained during clinical relapses. Four hundred eighty-three patients, with a mean of 3 longitudinal observations each, were identified who met these criteria. Initial analyses assessed the association between NLR and MLR as the outcomes, and psychological and demographic predictors in univariable and multivariable models controlling for age, gender and treatment. The second set of analyses assessed the association between clinical and MRI outcomes including whole brain atrophy and T2-hyperintense lesion volume, with NLR and MLR as predictors in univariable and multivariable models. All analyses used a mixed effects linear or logistic regression model with repeated measures.
RESULTS: Unadjusted analyses demonstrated significant associations between higher (log-transformed) NLR (but not MLR) and PRO measures including increasing depression (p = 0.01), fatigue (p < 0.01), and decreased physical quality of life (p < 0.01). Higher NLR and MLR strongly predicted increased MS-related disability as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, independent of all demographic, clinical, treatment-related, and psychosocial variables (p < 0.001). Lastly, higher NLR and MLR significantly discriminated progressive from relapsing status (p ≤ 0.01 for both), and higher MLR correlated with increased whole-brain atrophy (p < 0.05) but not T2 hyperintense lesion volume (p > 0.05) even after controlling for all clinical and demographic covariates. Sensitivity analyses using a subset of untreated patients (N = 146) corroborated these results.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated NLR and MLR may represent hematopoetic bias toward increased production and pro-inflammatory priming of the myeloid innate immune system (numerator) in conjunction with dysregulated adaptive immune processes (denominator), and consequently reflect a complementary and independent marker for severity of MS-related neurological disability and MRI outcomes.","2019",,"BMC Neurol"," OBJECTIVES / AIMS : To characterize clinical , neuroimaging , and psycho-neuro-immunological associations with NLR and MLR in persons with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) ","other","Adult, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Inflammation, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Logistic Models, FALSE, Lymphocytes, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Monocytes, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Multiple Sclerosis, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Neutrophils, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Quality of Life, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Severity and rate of progression of neuropathologies are important determinants of clinical Parkinson subtypes.
OBJECTIVE: To provide longitudinal clinical disease-course data and neuropathologic correlation for newly proposed Parkinson disease subtypes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with autopsy-confirmed Parkinson disease who were regularly seen throughout their disease course by hospital specialists in the United Kingdom and donated their brain at death to the Queen Square Brain Bank between January 2009 and December 2017. Patients with additional neuropathologic diagnoses, monogenic forms of parkinsonism, or insufficiently detailed clinical information were excluded. Based on severity of motor symptoms, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and autonomic and cognitive function at diagnosis, patients were classified adapting a subtyping classification into mild-motor predominant, intermediate, or diffuse malignant subtypes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Time from diagnosis to disease milestones (recurrent falls, wheelchair dependence, dementia, and care home placement) and death were compared between subtypes, and their risk was estimated using Cox hazard regression models. Severity and distribution of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer disease-related pathology were assessed using staging systems.
RESULTS: From a total of 146 patients, 111 patients were included (67 men [60.4%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 62.5 [11.5] years). The diffuse malignant subtype had earlier development of milestones and reduced survival. Cox proportional hazard regression showed an increased adjusted risk of any disease milestone (hazard ratio, 10.90; 95% CI, 5.51-21.58; P < .001) and death (hazard ratio, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.98-6.75; P < .001) in the diffuse malignant group.

Staging of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer disease-related pathology did not differ between subtypes, although they showed different rates of progression, and the latter was associated with age at death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parkinson clinical subtypes at diagnosis may estimate disease course and survival, which may be useful in providing a more accurate prognosis in individual patients in clinical practice and helping to stratify subgroups in clinical trials.

Evidence indicates a pivotal role of catecholamines in TTS, and researchers have discussed multiple hypotheses on the etiology, including multivessel coronary spasm, myocardial stunning, excessive transient ventricular afterload, and cardiac sympathetic overactivity with local noradrenaline spillover. Although central nervous system disorders, such as stroke and epilepsy, are known to trigger TTS, the incidence and clinical features of TTS in neurodegenerative disorders are poorly understood. Here, we retrospectively examined TTS cases in a single-center cohort composed of 250 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 870 patients with synucleinopathies [582 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 125 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 163 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA)] and identified 4 (1.6%, including 2 women) cases with ALS and no cases with synucleinopathies. Two ALS patients underwent autopsy and the pathological findings were compatible with the chronological changes identified in catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. A literature review identified 16 TTS cases with ALS, 1 case each with PD and DLB, and no cases with MSA. When current and previous TTS cases with ALS were concatenated: 55% (11/20) were female; 35% (7/20) had a bulbar-onset and 45% (9/20) had a limb-onset; the mean age of TTS onset was 63.3 ± 9.0 years and the mean interval time from ALS onset to TTS development was 4.9 ± 3.0 years; no (0/16) patients developed TTS within 12 months after ALS onset; 50% (10/20) underwent artificial ventilations; the mortality was 17% (3/18); and most cases had precipitating factors, and TTS development was associated with gastrostomy, tracheostomy, or infections in 45% (9/20) of the patients. This study demonstrated that ALS is a considerable predisposing factor of TTS and that synucleinopathies rarely cause TTS. The distinct TTS incidence between ALS and synucleinopathies may be due to cardiac sympathetic overactivity in ALS and may also be affected by cardiac sympathetic denervation in synucleinopathies. Moreover, the etiology of TTS in ALS may be reasonably explained by the two-hit theory.","2018",,"Front Neurol",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, autonomic symptoms have not been specifically assessed as a prognostic factor in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We evaluated whether development of autonomic symptoms is associated with disease progression and survival in PSP.
METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical data from consecutive patients with autopsy-confirmed PSP from the Queen Square Brain Bank between January 2012 and November 2016 was performed. Time from disease onset to four autonomic symptoms (constipation, urinary symptoms, erectile dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension) were noted. Time from diagnosis to five disease milestones and survival were calculated to assess disease progression, and their risk was estimated through a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: A total of 103 PSP patients were included. Urinary symptoms and constipation were present in 81% and 71% of cases, respectively. Early development of constipation and urinary symptoms were associated with higher risk of reaching the first disease milestone (respectively, HR: 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.92; p<0.001; and HR: 0.80; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.86; p<0.001) and with a shorter survival in these patients (respectively, HR: 0.73; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; p<0.001; and HR: 0.88; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96; p=0.004).

The date of diagnosis was determined as the onset of an overt neurological syndrome. The conversion rate was calculated; the risk of developing an overt neurological syndrome was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The estimated onset risk for a neurodegenerative syndrome from the time of IRBD diagnosis when the SC and NC cohorts were combined was 11.9%, 20.3%, 33.2%, and 51.4% at three, five, seven, and ten years, respectively. The phenoconversion rate (21.7% with a mean follow-up period from the time of IRBD diagnosis of 3.9 ± 3.0 years) was lower than in prior studies, but the conversion risk increased progressively as the follow-up period increased. The majority of patients developed Lewy body disease, while multiple system atrophy was rare. The risk of developing Lewy body disease differed significantly between the SC and NC cohorts (
CONCLUSIONS: In this first study of a large Asian IRBD population, the estimated conversion risk leading to diagnosis differed between the two cohorts, which could be attributed to different evaluation results depending on the observed population due to a referral bias and follow-up duration.

OBJECTIVES: To resolve the role of LRRK2 in the Indian population.
METHODS: We performed targeted resequencing of the LRRK2 locus in 288 cases and 298 controls and resolved the haplotypic structure of LRRK2 in a combined cohort of 800 cases and 402 controls in the Indian population. We assessed the frequency of novel missense variants in the white and East Asian population by leveraging exome sequencing and densely genotype data, respectively. We did computational modeling and biochemical approach to infer the potential role of novel variants impacting the LRRK2 protein function. Finally, we assessed the phosphorylation activity of identified novel coding variants in the LRRK2 gene.
RESULTS: We identified four novel missense variants with frequency ranging from 0.0008% to 0.002% specific for the Indian population, encompassing armadillo and kinase domains of the LRRK2 protein. A common genetic variability within LRRK2 may contribute to increased risk, but it was nonsignificant after correcting for multiple testing, because of small cohort size. The computational modeling showed destabilizing effect on the LRRK2 function. In comparison to the wild-type, the kinase domain variant showed 4-fold increase in the kinase activity.

Multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies are other neurodegenerative diseases in which α-synuclein aggregates are the main pathological characteristic. This is why these diseases are summarized as synucleinopathies. The abnormal α-Synuclein accumulation eventually results in the formation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in surviving neurons of the brain. α-Synuclein aggregation has been widely researched in vitro but little is known about α-synuclein aggregation in vivo. This is why it is still unclear whether α-synuclein accumulation and/or which of the resulting aggregates (soluble oligomers or insoluble fibrils) actually trigger neurotoxic events. In our study, we employed the robust genetic makeup of Drosophila melanogaster in combination with bimolecular fluorescence complementation and developed an in vivo assay allowing to determine abundance of soluble α-synuclein aggregates (most likely oligomers). Insoluble α-synuclein aggregates (most likely fibrils) are detected by filter retardation assay. We provide an experimental outline to verify the reported assay system. The described method is easy, inexpensive, fast, and sensitive. Altogether, the described assay system is ideal for large-scale screening approaches aiming to test/identify compounds/conditions that affect α-synuclein aggregation in vivo.Moreover, the experimental outline reported here could serve as a template to analyze aggregation of proteins other than α-synuclein. As accumulation of specific proteins is a hallmark of almost every neurodegenerative disease, only minor changes to our protocol should be necessary for a similar analysis.

We assessed RNA sequencing data from 238 temporal cortex (TCX) and 224 cerebellum (CER) samples from AD, PSP and control patients and identified co-expression networks, enriched in microglial genes and immune response GO terms, and which harbor PLCG2 and/or ABI3. These networks had higher expression in AD, but not in PSP TCX, compared to controls. This expression association did not survive adjustment for brain cell type population changes.

We identified microglial gene-enriched co-expression networks with significantly higher levels in AD TCX, but not in PSP, a primary tauopathy. This co-expression network association appears to be driven by microglial cell population changes in a brain region affected by AD pathology.

Dystonia, levodopa responsiveness, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and pyramidal signs were more common (P < .05) when compared with the data in late-onset MSA. On postmortem analysis, the minimal-change pathological variant was more common in young-onset MSA (n = 2) than late-onset MSA (P = .045), with a mean survival of 11.1 ± 3.2 years (range 5.5-14.6) in pathologically confirmed cases of young-onset MSA.

The purpose of this study was to obtain information from patients and caregivers regarding the symptoms and burden of nOH to expand on limited knowledge regarding the impact of nOH on quality of life.
METHODS: This author-designed survey included questions regarding nOH (e.g., frequency and impact of symptoms, management) and was conducted online by Harris Poll via distribution to individuals who agreed to participate in Harris Poll online surveys or who were members of relevant disease advocacy organizations. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years with PD, MSA, or pure autonomic failure and ≥ 1 of the following: orthostatic hypotension (OH), nOH, low blood pressure upon standing, or OH/nOH symptoms. Eligible caregivers cared for such patients but were not necessarily linked to any patient participant.
RESULTS: Survey responses were received from 363 patients and 128 caregivers. PD was the most frequent underlying disorder (90% of patients; 88% of individuals managed by the caregivers). Despite meeting survey diagnosis criteria, a formal diagnosis of OH or nOH was reported by only 36% of patients and 16% of caregivers. The most frequent symptoms of nOH were dizziness or lightheadedness, fatigue when standing, and difficulty walking. A negative impact on patient quality of life caused by nOH symptoms was reported by 59% of patients and 75% of caregivers. Most respondents (≥87%) reported that nOH symptoms adversely affected patients' ability to perform everyday activities (most frequently physical activity/exercise, housework, and traveling). Falls (≥1) in the previous year due to nOH symptoms were reported by 57% of patients and 80% of caregivers.
CONCLUSIONS: These survey results support the premise that nOH symptoms have a substantial negative impact on patient function and quality of life. The relatively low rates of formal nOH/OH diagnosis suggest the need for heightened awareness regarding the condition and its symptom burden.","2018",,"BMC Neurol"," The purpose of this study was to obtain information from patients and caregivers regarding the symptoms and burden of nOH to expand on limited knowledge regarding the impact of nOH on quality of life ","other","Adult, FALSE, Caregivers, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Humans, FALSE, Hypotension, Orthostatic, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Quality of Life, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Considering the overlap between the clinical manifestation and pathological characteristics of AD and Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), we conducted a large sample study to investigate the associations between these variants and these three common neurodegenerative diseases in a Chinese population.
METHODS: A total of 2449 patients, including 1219 PD, 870 sporadic ALS, and 360 MSA, and 821 healthy controls were examined for this study. All cases were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms using Sequenom iPLEX assay technology.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in genotype distribution and minor allele frequencies between the four candidate variants and the three neurodegenerative diseases. However, a significant difference was found in the minor allele frequency of rs28834970 in PTK2B between PD patients with normal and abnormal cognitive function (p = 0.001). Moreover, the minor allele ""C"" was associated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment in PD (OR = 1.84).

A number of recent studies show, aside from lower motor neuron degeneration and atrophy of skeletal muscles, widespread defects present in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral non-neuronal cell types of SMA patients and mouse models, particularly of severe forms. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the multi-organ manifestations of SMA were hardly understood. Here, using histology, flow cytometry and gene expression analysis in both messenger RNA and protein levels in various tissues, we found that a severe SMA mouse model develops systemic inflammation in early symptomatic stages. SMA mice had an enhanced intestinal permeability, resulting in microbial invasion into the circulatory system. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines was increased in all tissues and the acute phase response in the liver was activated. Systemic inflammation further mobilized glucocorticoid signaling and in turn led to dysregulation of a large set of genes, including robust upregulation of FAM107A in the spinal cord, increased expression of which has been implicated in neurodegeneration. Moreover, we show that lipopolysaccharide challenge markedly suppressed survival of motor neuron 2 exon 7 splicing in all examined peripheral and CNS tissues, resulting in global survival of motor neuron level reduction. Therefore, we identified a novel pathological mechanism in a severe SMA mouse model, which affects phenotypic severity through multiple paths and should contribute to progression of broad neuronal and non-neuronal defects.","2018",,"Hum Mol Genet",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Central Nervous System, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cytokines, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Flow Cytometry, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Inflammation, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Lipopolysaccharides, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Transgenic, FALSE, Muscle, Skeletal, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Muscular Atrophy, Spinal, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Spinal Cord, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Survival of Motor Neuron 1 Protein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Survival of Motor Neuron 2 Protein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Tumor Suppressor Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: A total of 168 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA, 89 patients with clinically diagnosed MSA, and 1,695 controls were included. TREM2 p.R47H was genotyped and assessed for association with MSA. Positive results in the Taqman genotyping assay were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The primary comparison involved patients with pathologically confirmed MSA and controls due to the definitive MSA diagnosis in the pathologically confirmed series.
RESULTS: We identified TREM2 p.R47H in 3 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA (1.79%), 1 patient with clinically diagnosed MSA (1.12%), and 7 controls (0.41%). Minimal AD pathology was observed for the pathologically confirmed MSA p.R47H carriers. For the primary comparison of patients with pathologically confirmed MSA and controls, risk of disease was significantly higher for p.R47H carriers (odds ratio [OR]: 4.39,

,"30077775","Oligodendrogliopathy in neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein aggregates: The forgotten partner.","Ferrer I","Oligodendrocytes are in contact with neurons, wrap axons with a myelin sheath that protects their structural integrity, and facilitate nerve conduction. Oligodendrocytes also form a syncytium with astrocytes which interacts with neurons, promoting reciprocal survival mediated by activity and by molecules involved in energy metabolism and trophism. Therefore, oligodendrocytes are key elements in the normal functioning of the central nervous system. Oligodendrocytes are affected following different insults to the central nervous system including ischemia, traumatism, and inflammation. The term oligodendrogliopathy highlights the prominent role of altered oligodendrocytes in the pathogenesis of certain neurological diseases, not only in demyelinating diseases and most leukodystrophies, but also in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein aggregates. Most of these diseases are characterized by the presence of abnormal protein deposits, forming characteristic and specific inclusions in neurons and astrocytes but also in oligodendrocytes, thus signaling their involvement in the disease. Emerging evidence suggests that such deposits in oligodendrocytes are not mere bystanders but rather are associated with functional alterations. Moreover, operative modifications in oligodendrocytes are also detected in the absence of oligodendroglial inclusions in certain diseases. The present review focuses first on general aspects of oligodendrocytes and precursors, and their development and functions, and then introduces and updates alterations and dysfunction of oligodendrocytes in selected neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein aggregates such as multiple system atrophy, Lewy body diseases, tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (TDP-43 proteinopathies), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob´s disease as a prototypical human prionopathy.","2018",,"Prog Neurobiol",," review","Animals, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Oligodendroglia, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Protein Aggregation, Pathological, FALSE, complications, Q000150",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: A cohort of 68 unilateral mTLE patients who had achieved an Engel class I outcome postsurgically was studied retrospectively. The volumes of multiple brain structures were extracted from preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images in each. The MR image data set consisted of 54 patients with imaging evidence for hippocampal sclerosis (HS-P) and 14 patients without (HS-N). Data mining techniques (i.e., feature extraction, feature selection, machine learning classifiers) were applied to provide measures of the relative contributions of structures and their correlations with one another. After removing redundant correlated structures, a minimum set of structures was determined as a marker for mTLE lateralization.
RESULTS: Using a logistic regression classifier, the volumes of both hippocampus and amygdala showed correct lateralization rates of 94.1%. This reflected about 11.7% improvement in accuracy relative to using hippocampal volume alone. The addition of thalamic volume increased the lateralization rate to 98.5%. This ternary-structural marker provided a 100% and 92.9% mTLE lateralization accuracy, respectively, for the HS-P and HS-N groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed tristructural MR imaging biomarker provides greater lateralization accuracy relative to single- and double-structural biomarkers and thus, may play a more effective role in the surgical decision-making process. Also, lateralization of the patients with insignificant atrophy of hippocampus by the proposed method supports the notion of associated structural changes involving the amygdala and thalamus.","2018",,"PLoS One"," PURPOSE : This study systematically investigates the predictive power of volumetric imaging feature sets extracted from select neuroanatomical sites in lateralizing the epileptogenic focus in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy ( mTLE ) patients ","other","Adult, FALSE, Amygdala, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Biomarkers, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Data Mining, TRUE, Electrocorticography, FALSE, Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Hippocampus, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Humans, FALSE, Logistic Models, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Sclerosis, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Support Vector Machine, FALSE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The post-mortem assessment included the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus, the thalamus and the putamen in five patients with MSA who received DBS and nine typical disease cases. There was no evidence for distinct neuroinflammatory profiles between both groups that could be related to the surgical procedure or that could explain the rapid clinical progression during DBS. Patients who received deep brain stimulation displayed a higher proportion of α-synuclein bearing neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the putamen compared with typical cases, while the number of surviving neurons was not different between groups. Our findings suggest that DBS does not induce neuroinflammatory changes in patients with MSA, at least several years after the surgery.

Expert commentary: Intracerebral administration, compared to peripheral delivery, is more invasive and carries the risk of open brain surgery. However, direct cell implantation bypasses the blood-brain barrier and reduces the first-pass effect, effectively increasing the therapeutic cell deposition at its intended site of action.

Adults typically present with hearing loss and balance disturbance, and children with ocular, dermatological, and neurological signs. Clinical diagnosis is confirmed by neuroimaging and genetic testing. Although ophthalmic features are present in patients with NF2, there are no reports correlating genetic severity subtypes with ophthalmic involvement.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed longitudinal ophthalmological data of 83 patients with NF2, with known genetic severity subtype, to determine visual function over time. We created a scoring system (Oxford NF2 Ophthalmic Score [ONOS]) to quantify visually debilitating pathology.
RESULTS: The prevalence of optic atrophy, combined hamartomas, cataract, and epiretinal membranes significantly increased with genetic severity. Median age of survival to visual acuity worse than 1.0 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution in one eye significantly decreased with genetic severity and was 38 years in the genetically severe group, 49 years in moderate classics, 64 years in mild classics, and 84 years in the tissue mosaics. In the genetically severe, the visually damaging pathologies were largely untreatable. The ONOS correlated with genetic severity longitudinally and cross-sectionally.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations associated with severe systemic disease result in greater visual morbidity at an earlier age.

Although usually sporadic, Parkinson's disease can result from inherited copy number variants in SNCA and other genes. We have hypothesized a role of somatic SNCA mutations, leading to mosaicism, in sporadic synucleinopathies. The evidence for mosaicism in healthy and diseased brain is increasing rapidly, with somatic copy number gains of APP reported in Alzheimer's brain. Here we demonstrate somatic SNCA copy number gains in synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy), focusing on substantia nigra. We selected sporadic cases with relatively young onset or short disease duration, and first excluded high level copy number variant mosaicism by DNA analysis using digital PCR for SNCA, and/or customized array comparative genomic hybridization. To detect low level SNCA copy number variant mosaicism, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide custom-designed probes for SNCA, validated on brain and fibroblasts with known copy number variants. We determined SNCA copy number in nigral dopaminergic neurons and other cells in frozen nigra sections from 40 cases with Parkinson's disease and five with multiple system atrophy, and 25 controls, in a blinded fashion. Parkinson's disease cases were significantly more likely than controls to have any SNCA gains in dopaminergic neurons (P = 0.0036), and overall (P = 0.0052). The average proportion of dopaminergic neurons with gains in each nigra was significantly higher in Parkinson's disease than controls (0.78% versus 0.45%; P = 0.017). There was a negative correlation between the proportion of dopaminergic neurons with gains and onset age in Parkinson's disease (P = 0.013), but not with disease duration, or age of death in cases or controls. Cases with tremor at onset were less likely to have gains (P = 0.035). All multiple system atrophy cases had gains, and the highest levels in dopaminergic neurons were in two of these cases (2.76%, 2.48%). We performed selective validation with different probes after dye swapping. All three control probes used showed minimal or no gains (≤0.1% in dopaminergic neurons). We also found occasional SNCA gains in frontal neurons of cases with Parkinson's disease, and the putamen of one multiple system atrophy case. We present evidence of somatic SNCA gains in brain, more commonly in nigral dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson's disease than controls, negatively correlated with onset age, and possibly commonest in some multiple system atrophy cases.

Secondary RBD is well described in association with neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and other conditions involving brainstem structures such as tumors. However, RBD alone is now considered to be a potential harbinger of later development of neurodegenerative disorders, in particular PD, MSA, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and pure autonomic failure. These conditions are linked by their underpinning pathology of alpha-synuclein protein aggregation. In RBD, it is therefore important to recognize the potential risk for later development of an alpha-synucleinopathy, and to investigate for other potential causes such as medications. Other signs and symptoms have been described in RBD, such as orthostatic hypotension, or depression. While it is important to recognize these features to improve patient management, they may ultimately provide clinical clues that will lead to risk stratification for phenoconversion. A critical need is to improve our ability to counsel patients, particularly with regard to prognosis. The ability to identify who, of those with RBD, is at high risk for later neurodegenerative disorders will be paramount, and would in addition advance our understanding of the prodromal stages of the alpha-synucleinopathies.

We assessed the extent of tau, amyloid-β, α-synuclein and TDP-43 proteinopathies in 766 autopsied individuals representing a broad spectrum of clinical neurodegenerative disease. We interrogated pathological Alzheimer's disease (n = 247); other tauopathies (n = 95) including Pick's disease, corticobasal disease and progressive supranuclear palsy; the synucleinopathies (n = 164) including multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disease; the TDP-43 proteinopathies (n = 188) including frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and a minimal pathology group (n = 72). Each group was divided into subgroups without or with co-pathologies. Age and sex matched logistic regression models compared co-pathology prevalence between groups. Co-pathology prevalence was similar between the minimal pathology group and most neurodegenerative diseases for each proteinopathy: tau was nearly universal (92-100%), amyloid-β common (20-57%); α-synuclein less common (4-16%); and TDP-43 the rarest (0-16%). In several neurodegenerative diseases, co-pathology increased: in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein (41-55%) and TDP-43 (33-40%) increased; in progressive supranuclear palsy, α-synuclein increased (22%); in corticobasal disease, TDP-43 increased (24%); and in neocortical Lewy body disease, amyloid-β (80%) and TDP-43 (22%) increased. Total co-pathology prevalence varied across groups (27-68%), and was increased in high Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and neocortical Lewy body disease (70-81%). Increased age at death was observed in the minimal pathology group, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple system atrophy cases with co-pathologies. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neocortical Lewy body disease, co-pathologies associated with APOE ɛ4. Lewy body disease cases with Alzheimer's disease co-pathology had substantially lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores than pure Lewy body disease.

To test the hypothesis that IBD is associated with risk of PD and MSA, we performed a nationwide population-based cohort study.
DESIGN: The cohort consisted of all individuals diagnosed with IBD in Denmark during 1977-2014 (n=76 477) and non-IBD individuals from the general population, who were comparable in terms of gender, age and vital status (n=7 548 259). All cohort members were followed from IBD diagnosis/index date to occurrence of PD and MSA (according to the Danish National Patient Register).
RESULTS: Patients with IBD had a 22% increased risk of PD as compared with non-IBD individuals (HR=1.22; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.35). The increased risk was present independently of age at IBD diagnosis, gender or length of follow-up. The overall incidence of MSA was low in our study, and the regression analysis suggested a tendency towards higher risk of developing MSA in patients with IBD as compared with non-IBD individuals (HR=1.41; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.44).

While the typical focal hyperintense lesions seen on T2 and FLAIR sequences in several areas of the central nervous system are key features for MS diagnosis, they can also be used to monitor disease activity, particularly in asymptomatic patients, and to evaluate therapeutic responses. The development of new lesions, particularly in medullary and infratentorial locations, is a strong predictor of long-term disability and risk of evolution to a secondary-progressive phase. Yet, changes in T2 lesion volume are poor predictors of subsequent disease evolution in many cases, a situation often referred to as the ""clinicoradiological paradox"". Nevertheless, advanced MRI techniques allow quantification of several pathological processes in vivo and offer insights into MS pathophysiology beyond white matter lesions.

METHODS: 220 probable MSA patients were included from 2009 to 2013. Disease severity was measured by the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS). The univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with survival in MSA patients. A nomogram model predicting the probability of survival was formulated based on the results of the multivariate Cox analysis. The results were validated using bootstrap resampling and a prospective study on 80 patients included from January 2014 to August 2015 at the same institution.
RESULTS: Median survival from symptom onset to death was 6.4 years (95%CI = 6.1-6.7). The multivariate Cox survival model suggested that autonomic onset, higher UMSARS score, frequent falls, orthostatic hypotension(OH) and shorter diagnostic delay were associated with poor survival. The nomogram model for the multivariate Cox survival model had a concordance index of 0.677 in primary cohort, which showed a concordance index of 0.721 in validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: Autonomic onset, higher UMSARS score, frequent falls, OH and shorter diagnostic delay at baseline were independent markers for poor survival in MSA.

The phenotypic spectrum may present overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the basis of CAG repeat length as ""normal"", ""intermediate"" or ""expanded"" according to literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P (p < 0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to MSA-P and controls (p < 0.0001).

In this paper, we present a new theoretical model from a viewpoint of complex system with chaos model to reproduce and explain the non-linear clinical and pathological manifestations in MS. First, we adopted a discrete logistic equation with non-linear dynamics to prepare a scalar quantity for the strength of pathogenic factor at a specific location of the central nervous system at a specific time to reflect the negative feedback in immunity. Then, we set distinct minimum thresholds in the above-mentioned scalar quantity for demyelination possibly causing clinical relapses and for cerebral atrophy. With this simple model, we could theoretically reproduce all the subtypes of relapsing-remitting MS, primary progressive MS, and secondary progressive MS. With the sensitivity to initial conditions and sensitivity to minute change in parameters of the chaos theory, we could also reproduce the spatial dissemination. Such chaotic behavior could be reproduced with other similar upward-convex functions with appropriate set of initial conditions and parameters.

METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of the amygdala and basal forebrain from 186 autopsy-confirmed MSA cases were screened with immunohistochemistry for phospho-TDP-43. In cases having TDP-43 pathology, additional brain regions were assessed. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence double-staining and immunogold electron microscopy (IEM) were performed to evaluate colocalization of TDP-43 and α-synuclein. Genetic risk factors for TDP-43 pathology were also analysed.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed various morphologies of TDP-43 pathology in 13 cases (7%), such as subpial astrocytic inclusions, neuronal inclusions, dystrophic neurites, perivascular inclusions and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that only advanced age, but not concurrent Alzheimer's disease, argyrophilic grain disease or hippocampal sclerosis, was an independent risk factor for TDP-43 pathology in MSA (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19, P = 0.002). TDP-43 pathology was restricted to the amygdala in eight cases and extended to the hippocampus in two cases. The remaining three cases had widespread TDP-43 pathology.

A total of 350 RBD patients and 869 controls were sequenced, and regression and burden models were used to examine the association between LRRK2 variants and RBD.
RESULTS: No pathogenic mutations that are known to cause PD were identified in RBD patients. The p.N551K-p.R1398H-p.K1423K haplotype was associated with a reduced risk for RBD (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.98, p = 0.0055 for the tagging p.N551K substitution). A common variant, p.S1647T, was nominally associated with risk for RBD (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.05-1.56, p = 0.029). Burden analysis identified associations with domains and exons that were derived by the variants of the protective haplotype, and no burden of other rare variants was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the LRRK2 p.N551K-p.R1398H-p.K1423K haplotype have a reduced risk for developing RBD, yet PD-causing mutations probably have minor or no role in RBD. Additional work is needed to confirm these results and to identify the mechanism associated with reduced risk for RBD.","2018",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Haplotypes, FALSE, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Protective Factors, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Sequence Analysis, DNA, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, the roles of some important loci, such as HNMT Thr105Ile, STK39 rs2390669, and NMD3 rs34016896, have not been clarified in Chinese populations. Accumulating evidence indicates that some common clinicopathological characteristics are shared by different neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, we conducted a large sample study to investigate associations between these variants and PD, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Chinese populations. A total of 2417 patients, including 1237 PD, 850 SALS, and 330 MSA patients, along with 836 healthy controls (HCs) were examined in this study. All patients were genotyped for SNPs using the Sequenom iPLEX assay. No significant differences were found in the genotype and allele frequency distributions between the three neurodegenerative diseases and three candidate variants investigated. In subgroup analysis, compared with PD patients with initial symptom of tremor and HCs, the minor allele frequency of NMD3 rs34016896 in PD patients with initial symptoms of rigidity/bradykinesia was significantly lower. In addition, female patients carrying the rs34016896 minor allele had an increased risk of developing MSA (OR 1.25, 95% CI [1.09-1.43]), and ALS patients carrying the Ile105 polymorphism on the Thr105Ile allele in the HNMT gene exhibited a trend toward a delay in symptom onset of 3.010 ± 1.629 years. Our results indicate that the presence of the rs34016896 allele in the NMD3 gene may contribute to the development of synucleinopathies and that the Thr105Ile allele in the HNMT gene could potentially be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of ALS.","2018",,"J Mol Neurosci"," Consequently , we conducted a large sample study to investigate associations between these variants and PD , multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) in Chinese populations ","other","Aged, FALSE, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, China, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Histamine N-Methyltransferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, TRUE, Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, RNA-Binding Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Given that infants have distinct sleep and breathing patterns when compared to older children, the outcomes of infants on long-term NIV may differ as well. The aim of this study is to systematically review the use and outcomes of long-term NIV in infants.
METHODS: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, CINAHL (via EbscoHOST), PubMed, and Wiley Cochrane Library were systematically searched from January 1990 to July 2017. Studies on infants using long-term NIV outside of an acute care setting were included. Data were extracted on study design, population characteristics, and NIV outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 327 studies were full-text reviewed, with final inclusion of 60. Studies were distributed across airway (40%), neuromuscular (28%), central nervous system (10%), cardio-respiratory (2%), and multiple (20%) disease categories. Of the 18 airway studies reporting on NIV outcomes, 13 (72%) reported improvements in respiratory parameters. Of the 12 neuromuscular studies exclusively on spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1), six (50%) reported decreased hospitalizations and nine (75%) reported on mortality outcomes. Risk of bias was moderate to serious, and quality of the evidence was low to very low for all studies. Most studies had an observational design with no control group, limiting the potential for a meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes reported in studies differed by the disease category being studied. Studies on airway conditions showed improvements in respiratory parameters for infants using NIV. Studies on neuromuscular disorder, which were almost exclusively on SMA1, reported decreased hospitalizations and prolonged survival. Overall, it appears that NIV is an effective long-term therapy for infants.

However, LRRK2 mutations can also lead to a variety of pathological phenotypes other than typical PD, including relatively pure nigrostriatal cell loss without alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The mechanisms behind this remarkable pleomorphic pathology are currently unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To genetically and pathologically characterize a case with a LRRK2, p.Ile1371Val rare variant and pathologically proven MSA.
METHODS: From the brain donation program at the Parkinson's Institute and Clinical Center, we selected 26 brains with family history and a with clinicopathological diagnosis of PD (n = 20), MSA (n = 4), or PSP (n = 2). We performed neuropathological evaluation, including alpha-synuclein and tau immunohistochemistry and sequenced 188 genes that have been reported as causative for or associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
RESULTS: We identified a known LRRK2, p.Ile1371Val genetic variant in a case with clinically diagnosed and pathologically proven MSA. Neuropathology revealed that the olivopontocerebellar system was more affected than the striatonigral system.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that genetic variants in the LRRK2 gene can present clinically and neuropathologically as MSA.

These changes are likely to increase the risk of developing chronic secondary conditions and impact the quality of life in persons with SCI. Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation evoked resistance training (NMES-RT) was developed as a strategy to attenuate the process of skeletal muscle atrophy, decrease ectopic adiposity, improve insulin sensitivity and enhance mitochondrial capacity. However, NMES-RT is limited to only a single muscle group. Involving multiple muscle groups of the lower extremities may maximize the health benefits of training. Functional electrical stimulation-lower extremity cycling (FES-LEC) allows for the activation of 6 muscle groups, which is likely to evoke greater metabolic and cardiovascular adaptation. Appropriate knowledge of the stimulation parameters is key to maximizing the outcomes of electrical stimulation training in persons with SCI. Adopting strategies for long-term use of NMES-RT and FES-LEC during rehabilitation may maintain the integrity of the musculoskeletal system, a pre-requisite for clinical trials aiming to restore walking after injury. The current manuscript presents a combined protocol using NMES-RT prior to FES-LEC.

Sequence analysis of GmCaspase proteins showed that each caspase shared conserved domains like ""HG"", ""QACXG (X for R, G or Q)"" and ""GSWF"" except GmCasp10. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree showed that GmCasp8 and GmCasp10 were quite different from those of other fishes. 3-D models indicated that structure of GmCasp3 is very conservative, but GmCasp6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are less conservative. Tissue distribution analysis showed that six Gmcaspases mRNA transcripts were detected in tissues of intestine, gill, thymus, head-kidney and spleen with different abundance, but Gmcasp7 were not detected in the brain. GmCasp3 transcript was kept at very low level in the early development stages, while the expression levels of GmCasp6, 7, 8, 10 were different at various development stages.

Augmenting serotonergic transmission through selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been proposed to improve stridor and prolong survival in multiple system atrophy (MSA). We sought to determine whether MSA patients on an SSRI during their disease course have improved survival compared to those not on an SSRI.
METHODS: Review of all MSA patients from 1998 to 2012 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester who completed autonomic function testing. Use of SSRI medications was obtained from patient-provided medication lists in the electronic medical record. Clinical symptoms were collected from patient histories; the presence of stridor was obtained from clinical histories and polysomnogram. Surviving patients were called to assess for stridor and SSRI use.
RESULTS: Of 685 MSA patients, 132 (19%) were on an SSRI. Median time from symptom onset to death was 7.5 years with no difference based on SSRI use (p = .957). Rates of stridor were similar in SSRI users and non-users based on patient report and polysomnography (p = .494 and p = .181, respectively). SSRI use was associated with parkinsonism (p = .027) and falls (p = .002). Stridor was similar in SSRI users and those not on an SSRI.

Herein, we conducted this case-control study to evaluate the possible correlation between the five SNPs related to inflammation and MSA in Chinese Han population.
METHODS AND PATIENTS: We recruited 154 sporadic patients with MSA and 223 health controls in this study. All subjects were genotyped for the five SNPs using polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: TNF-α rs1799964, genotype distribution and minor allele frequency (MAF) showed significant differences between patients and controls, which might illustrate the minor allele C may increase the risk for MSA (genotype, P = 0.006, OR = 1.245, 95% CI = [1.066-1.455]; allele, P = 0.001, OR = 1.887, 95% CI = [1.303-2.733]).

We investigated whether testing for CAN combined with sweat function assessment was helpful to differentiate patients with MSA from those with PD.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 62 patients with MSA-P and 96 with PD, comparable in age, BMI and sex ratio with disease duration of 4.3±2.5 years for MSA vs. 11.5±6 years for PD (P<0.0001) were tested for CAN using heart rate changes with deep breathing (HR-DB), stand test (HR-ST) and Valsalva maneuver (HR-VM) and blood pressure changes during stand test (BPs-ST and BPd-ST), Valsalva maneuver (BPs-VM-II and IV), hand grip (BPd-HG) and the total ""Ewing"" score tests (EwS), and for sweating function using electrochemical skin conductance for hands and feet (HESC and FESC).
RESULTS: In MSA-P abnormal EwS, HR-DB, BP-ST and ESC were more frequent compared to PD, despite longer disease duration for PD. Using a model adjusted for sex, BMI, age, disease duration and treatment, the Odds Ratio for having MSA-P vs. PD based on EwS was 2.71, on HR-DB 2.36, on BP-ST 2.87 and on ESC 4.94 while it was 11.68 (2.17-62.79) for the combination of the three last tests.

METHODS: Baseline EPVSs were scored on 1.5T MRI in 30 converters to moderate-severe disability, and 30 nonconverters matched for baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: EPVS scores were not significantly different between converters and nonconverters, nor associated with accrual of lesions or brain atrophy.

Neurodegeneration usually affects, but is not limited to, the cerebral cortex, intracranial white matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum. Although the majority of neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic, Mendelian inheritance is well documented. Intriguingly, the clinical presentations and neuropathological findings in inherited neurodegenerative forms are often indistinguishable from those of sporadic cases, suggesting that converging genomic signatures and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlie both hereditary and sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, effective therapies for these diseases are scarce to non-existent.

CNVs affect gene expression by altering the genome structure and transposable elements within a region. CNVs are greater than 1 kb in size; hence, CNVs can produce more variation than can individual single-nucleotide variations that are detected by next-generation sequencing. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an α-synucleinopathy adult-onset disorder. Pathologically, it is characterized by insoluble aggregation of filamentous α-synuclein in brain oligodendrocytes. Generally, MSA is sporadic, although there are rare cases of familial MSA. In addition, the frequencies of the clinical phenotypes differ considerably among countries. Reports indicate that genetic factors play roles in the mechanisms involved in the pathology and onset of MSA. To evaluate the genetic background of this disorder, we attempted to determine whether there are differences in CNVs between patients with MSA and normal control subjects. We found that the number of CNVs on chromosomes 5, 22, and 4 was increased in MSA; 3 CNVs in non-coding regions were considered risk factors for MSA. Our results show that CNVs in non-coding regions influence the expression of genes through transcription-related mechanisms and potentially increase subsequent structural alterations of chromosomes.

Nearly half the world's population is infected with HP, but only a small percentage of those develop significant pathology. The bacteria itself does not directly cause cancer; rather it promotes an environment that is conducive to tumor formation. Upon infection, HP induces transcriptional changes in the host, leading to enhanced proliferation and host immune response. In addition, HP causes direct damage to gastric epithelial cells.
RESULTS: We present a multiscale mechanistic model of HP induced changes. The model includes four modules representing the host transcriptional changes in response to infection, gastric atrophy, the Hedgehog pathway response, and the restriction point that controls cell cycle. This model was able to recapture a number of literature reported observations and was used as an ""in silico"" representation of the biological system for further analysis. Dynamical analysis of the model revealed that HP might induce the activation of multiple interplayed positive feedbacks, which in turn might result in a ""ratchet ladder"" system that promotes a unidirectional progression of gastric disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The current multiscale model is able to recapitulate the observed experimental features of HP host interactions and provides dynamic insights on the epidemiologically observed heterogeneity in disease progression. This model provides a solid framework that can be further expanded and validated to include additional experimental evidence, to understand the complex multi-pathway interactions characterizing HP infection, and to design novel treatment protocols for HP induced diseases.","2017",,"BMC Syst Biol",,"other","Disease Progression, FALSE, Hedgehog Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Helicobacter Infections, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Helicobacter pylori, TRUE, Host-Pathogen Interactions, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Models, Theoretical, FALSE, Stomach Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

To examine the possible genetic association of rs11868035 with sporadic PD, sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) in a Chinese population, we conducted this large case-control study.
METHODS: A total of 3115 subjects, which included 1150 sporadic PD, 833 sporadic ALS, 318 MSA patients, and 814 controls, were recruited in the study. All of the subjects were genotyped for rs11868035 using the Sequenom iPLEX Assay.
RESULTS: Significant differences in the genotype distributions and minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs11868035 were observed between early onset ALS (EOALS) and matched controls (P=0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) and between female ALS patients and matched controls (P=0.016 and P=0.010, respectively).

Following the suggestion that alpha-synuclein pathology gradually spreads through the nervous system following a stereotypic pattern and the discovery that aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein can propagate pathology from one cell to another, and thereby probably aggravate existing deficits as well as generate additional symptoms, the idea that alpha-synuclein is a viable therapeutic target gained further support. In this review we describe current challenges and possibilities with alpha-synuclein as a therapeutic target. We briefly highlight gaps in the knowledge of the role of alpha-synuclein in disease, and propose that a deeper understanding of the pathobiology of alpha-synuclein can lead to improved therapeutic strategies. We describe several treatment approaches that are currently being tested in advanced animal experiments or already are in clinical trials. We have divided them into approaches that reduce alpha-synuclein production; inhibit alpha-synuclein aggregation inside cells; promote its degradation either inside or outside cells; and reduce its uptake by neighbouring cells following release from already affected neurons. Finally, we briefly discuss challenges related to the clinical testing of alpha-synuclein therapies, for example difficulties in monitoring target engagement and the need for relatively large trials of long duration. We conclude that alpha-synuclein remains one of the most compelling therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease, and related synucleinopathies, and that the multitude of approaches being tested provides hope for the future.","2017",,"Exp Neurol",," review","Animals, FALSE, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Genetic Therapy, TRUE, methods, Q000379, Humans, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, therapy, Q000628, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent 
RESULTS: Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up, 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson's disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, and multiple system atrophy in 1) with mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.9 years from imaging. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs 6% at 3 years, 33% vs 18% at 5 years; log rank test, p = 0.006). Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease free after 3 years of follow-up. At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy.
INTERPRETATION: DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after 3 years' follow-up.

SUBJECT AND METHODS: Cross sectional study design. A total of 73 patients were classified in MSA, PSP and PD for testing aged between 38 yrs and 70 yrs according to respective diagnostic criteria. A simple bedside water swallowing test was performed using 90 cc of water. Detailed assessment was done to check swallowing function.
RESULTS: The mean age of both experimental group and control group was 62.4±8.37 yrs. and 61.05±7.07 yrs. Males were affected more in every pathological group compared to females. The dysphagia presented earlier in PSP and MSA groups as compared to PD groups. The water swallowing speed was found to be significantly less than 10ml/sec amongst three neurological groups compared to control group.

At six months before admission, a mass was observed in the neck. The physical examination showed that she had hypertension and no abnormal findings in the central nervous system. The brain magnetic resonance imaging manifested long T1 and T2 signals, high signal intensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, and iso-signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging in the white matter of the left occipital lobe. Therefore, the cause of convulsions was considered as PRES. Mass biopsy suggested PAN and no findings supported tuberculosis. The right kidney atrophy was observed by ultrasound examination. Emission computed tomography of the kidney showed multiple vascular stenosis and no blood perfusion in the right kidney, so PAN was confirmed. These findings suggest that PAN should be considered in patients with vasculitis who had involvements of multiple systems after excluding common vasculitis, such as Kawasaki disease and Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

Skin swabs demonstrated the presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) DNA. There was no history of previous HSV1 exposure. There is scant literature on uncomplicated cutaneous HSV1 since the majority is oral/genital. The incidence of transmission varies and is dependent on site of infection and immunological status. Type-specific serological testing is recommended to identify a primary first episode infection due to the 30-60% vertical transmission rate. Infection is associated with morbidity and mortality for both mother and fetus including maternal encephalitis, acute retinal necrosis, pneumonia and hepatitis. Neonatal disease can be congenital (cutaneous lesions, microcephaly, hydranencephaly, intracranial calcifications, chorioretinitis, microphthalmia and optic nerve atrophy) or acquired (skin, eyes and mouth disease or central nervous system disease or disseminated disease). Prophylactic aciclovir reduces the number of women with active genital lesions at the time of delivery.

We investigated the impact of specific neuroinflammatory markers on human neurons to identify potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection against chronic inflammation.
METHODS: Surface immunocytochemistry directly visualized protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors on neurons in human postmortem cortex in patients with and without neuroinflammatory lesions. Viability of cultured neurons was determined after exposure to cerebrospinal fluid from patients with progressive multiple sclerosis or purified granzyme B and IL-1β. Inhibitors of PAR1 activation and of PAR1-associated second messenger signaling were used to elucidate a mechanism of neurotoxicity.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of human post-mortem brain tissue demonstrated cells expressing higher amounts of PAR1 near and within subcortical lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis compared to control tissue. Human cerebrospinal fluid samples containing granzyme B and IL-1β were toxic to human neuronal cultures. Granzyme B was neurotoxic through activation of PAR1 and subsequently the phospholipase Cβ-IP3 second messenger system. Inhibition of PAR1 or IP3 prevented granzyme B toxicity. IL-1β enhanced granzyme B-mediated neurotoxicity by increasing PAR1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurons within the inflamed central nervous system are imperiled because they express more PAR1 and are exposed to a neurotoxic combination of both granzyme B and IL-1β. The effects of these inflammatory mediators may be a contributing factor in the progressive brain atrophy associated with neuroinflammatory diseases.

However, the few available studies on Parkinson disease (PD) have conflicting results, comprise a small number of patients, have short follow-up periods, and lack pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of time of onset of AutD with disease progression and survival in PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective review of clinical data from 100 consecutive patients with an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of PD from the archives of the Queen Square Brain Bank in London, United Kingdom, from January 1, 2006, to June 3, 2016, included patients with PD regularly seen by hospital specialists (neurologists or geriatricians) in the United Kingdom throughout their disease until death. Patients with dementia before or within 1 year after onset of motor symptoms, monogenic forms of PD, comorbidities that affect autonomic function, a coexisting neuropathologic diagnosis, or insufficient clinical information were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival and time from diagnosis to specific disease milestones were calculated to assess disease progression. Autonomic dysfunction was defined as autonomic failure at autonomic function testing or 2 of the following symptoms: urinary symptoms, constipation, upper gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, sweating abnormalities, or erectile dysfunction. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models on the risk of a disease milestone and death were used.
RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (60 [60.0%] male; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 63.9 [10.3] years; mean [SD] disease duration, 14.6 [7.7] years) were studied. Autonomic dysfunction developed in 85 patients (mean [SD] time from diagnosis, 6.7 [7.7] years) and was associated with older age at diagnosis, male sex, poor initial levodopa treatment response, and postural instability and gait difficulty motor PD subtype in linear regression analysis, but staging of α-synuclein pathologic changes was unrelated. Earlier AutD increased the risk of reaching the first milestone (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89; P < .001) and shortened survival (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96; P < .001).

We assessed the documentation of the degenerative disorder on DCs and evaluated comorbidities and causes of death among parkinsonian patients.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were systematically and prospectively collected on deceased patients followed at a tertiary movement disorder clinic. DCs data included the documentation of parkinsonism, causes, and place of death.
RESULTS: Among 138 cases, 84 (60.9%) male, mean age 77.9 years, mean age of onset 66.7, and mean disease duration 10.9 years. Clinical diagnoses included PD (73.9%), progressive supranuclear palsy (10.9%), multiple system atrophy (7.2%), Lewy body dementia (7.2%) and corticobasal degeneration (0.7%). Psychosis occurred in 60.1% cases, dementia in 48.5%. Most PD patients died due to heterogeneous causes before reaching advanced stages. Non-PD parkinsonian patients died earlier due to causes linked to the advanced neurodegenerative process. PD was documented in 38.4% of DCs with different forms of inconsistencies. That improved, but remained significant when it was signed by a specialist.
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of PD cases died while still ambulatory and independent, after a longer disease course and due to causes commonly seen in that age group. Deaths among advanced PD patients occurred due to causes similar to what we found in non-PD cases. These findings can be useful for clinical, prognostic and counseling purposes.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of early gastric cancer (EGC) arising from adenoma, compared with those of EGC without pre-existing adenoma.
METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic resection for EGC at a single tertiary hospital were divided into two groups based on the presence (ex-adenoma group) or absence (de novo group) of pre-existing adenoma on pathologic specimens. Clinicopathologic characteristics, endoscopic features and long-term outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 1,509 patients, 236 (15.6%) were included in the ex-adenoma group. Mean age (P = 0.003) and Helicobacter pylori infection rate (P = 0.040) were significantly higher in the ex-adenoma than in the de novo group. Mean endoscopic size was significantly larger, elevated lesions were more prevalent (both P < 0.001), and carcinomas were more differentiated in the ex-adenoma group than in the de novo group (P = 0.037). The degree of atrophy (P = 0.025) or intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.001) was more advanced in the ex-adenoma group.

Understanding the long-term outcomes of these conditions may inform patients and caregivers of the expected disease duration and may help with care planning.
OBJECTIVE: To compare survival rates and causes of death among patients with incident, clinically diagnosed synucleinopathies and age- and sex-matched referent participants.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based study used the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system to identify all residents in Olmsted County, Minnesota, who received a diagnostic code of parkinsonism from 1991 through 2010. A movement-disorders specialist reviewed the medical records of each individual to confirm the presence of parkinsonism and determine the type of synucleinopathy. For each confirmed patient, an age- and sex-matched Olmsted County resident without parkinsonism was also identified.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We determined the age- and sex-adjusted risk of death for each type of synucleinopathy, the median time from diagnosis to death, and the causes of death.
RESULTS: Of the 461 patients with synucleinopathies, 279 (60.5%) were men, and of the 452 referent participants, 272 (60.2%) were men. From 1991 through 2010, 461 individuals received a diagnosis of a synucleinopathy (309 [67%] of Parkinson disease, 81 [17.6%] of dementia with Lewy bodies, 55 [11.9%] of Parkinson disease dementia, and 16 [3.5%] of multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism). During follow-up, 68.6% (n = 316) of the patients with synucleinopathies and 48.7% (n = 220) of the referent participants died. Patients with any synucleinopathy died a median of 2 years earlier than referent participants. Patients with multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism (hazard ratio, 10.51; 95% CI, 2.92-37.82) had the highest risk of death compared with referent participants, followed by those with dementia with Lewy bodies (hazard ratio, 3.94; 95% CI, 2.61-5.94), Parkinson disease with dementia (hazard ratio, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.36-6.30), and Parkinson disease (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.39-2.21). Neurodegenerative disease was the most frequent cause of death listed on the death certificate for patients, and cardiovascular disease was the most frequent cause of death among referent participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individuals with multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia have increased mortality compared with the general population.

Recent studies found that two polymorphisms (rs363371 and rs363324) in VMAT2 might be a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) in Caucasians, while the two other variants (rs1990622 and rs3173615) in TMEM106B increased the risk for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Considering the overlap between clinical manifestation and pathologic characteristics in neurodegenerative diseases, we conducted a large-sample study to investigate the associations between these four polymorphisms and the risk for PD, sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) in a Chinese patient population.
METHODS: A total of 1121 PD, 863 SALS, and 356 MSA patients, as well as 829 healthy controls (HCs), were included in the study. These four polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom iPLEX Assay technology.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the genotype distribution of VMAT2 rs363371 between SALS patients and HCs (p=0.001). In an additive model, ""GG"" of rs363371 significantly decreased the risk for SALS (p<0.001, OR: 0.49, 95% CI [0.36-0.67]). The frequencies of minor alleles for rs1990622 and rs3173615 in TMEM106B were significantly different between PD patients with initial symptoms of tremor and rigidity/bradykinesia (p=0.001), and between patients with initial symptom of rigidity/bradykinesia and HCs (p<0.001). The minor alleles ""T"" of rs1990622 and ""C"" of rs3173615 increased the risk for PD patients with initial symptom of rigidity/bradykinesia (OR: 1.21[1.10-1.34] and OR: 1.19[1.07-1.31], respectively). No differences were found in the genotype distribution and allele frequency of the four polymorphisms between MSA patients and HCs.

Multiple system atrophy is a fatal sporadic adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder with no symptomatic or disease-modifying treatment available. The cytopathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy is the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes, forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions. Impaired insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling (IGF-1) and insulin resistance (i.e. decreased insulin/IGF-1) have been reported in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence also suggests impaired insulin/IGF-1 signalling in multiple system atrophy, as corroborated by increased insulin and IGF-1 plasma concentrations in multiple system atrophy patients and reduced IGF-1 brain levels in a transgenic mouse model of multiple system atrophy. We here tested the hypothesis that multiple system atrophy is associated with brain insulin resistance and showed increased expression of the key downstream messenger insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylated at serine residue 312 in neurons and oligodendrocytes in the putamen of patients with multiple system atrophy. Furthermore, the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) phosphorylated at serine residue 312 was more apparent in inclusion bearing oligodendrocytes in the putamen. By contrast, it was not different between both groups in the temporal cortex, a less vulnerable structure compared to the putamen. These findings suggest that insulin resistance may occur in multiple system atrophy in regions where the neurodegenerative process is most severe and point to a possible relation between α-synuclein aggregates and insulin resistance. We also observed insulin resistance in the striatum of transgenic multiple system atrophy mice and further demonstrate that the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue exendin-4, a well-tolerated and Federal Drug Agency-approved antidiabetic drug, has positive effects on insulin resistance and monomeric α-synuclein load in the striatum, as well as survival of nigral dopamine neurons. Additionally, plasma levels of exosomal neural-derived IRS-1 phosphorylated at serine residue 307 (corresponding to serine residue 312 in humans) negatively correlated with survival of nigral dopamine neurons in multiple system atrophy mice treated with exendin-4. This finding suggests the potential for developing this peripheral biomarker candidate as an objective outcome measure of target engagement for clinical trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues in multiple system atrophy. In conclusion, our observation of brain insulin resistance in multiple system atrophy patients and transgenic mice together with the beneficial effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist exendin-4 in transgenic mice paves the way for translating this innovative treatment into a clinical trial.","2017",,"Brain"," This finding suggests the potential for developing this peripheral biomarker candidate as an objective outcome measure of target engagement for clinical trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues in multiple system atrophy ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Cell Survival, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Corpus Striatum, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Dopaminergic Neurons, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Exenatide, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Insulin Resistance, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Transgenic, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Oligodendroglia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Peptides, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Phosphorylation, FALSE, Protein Aggregation, Pathological, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Putamen, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Temporal Lobe, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Venoms, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Unfortunately, the course of the disease cannot be improved by drug or surgical treatment. In addition, symptomatic treatment options are currently limited, and therapeutic benefits are often only transient.

From 1980 to 2010, 14 retired footballers with dementia were followed up regularly until death. Their clinical data, playing career, and concussion history were prospectively collected. Next-of-kin provided consent for six to have post-mortem brain examination. Of the 14 male participants, 13 were professional and 1 was a committed amateur. All were skilled headers of the ball and had played football for an average of 26 years. Concussion rate was limited in six cases to one episode each during their careers. All cases developed progressive cognitive impairment with an average age at onset of 63.6 years and disease duration of 10 years. Neuropathological examination revealed septal abnormalities in all six post-mortem cases, supportive of a history of chronic repetitive head impacts. Four cases had pathologically confirmed CTE; concomitant pathologies included Alzheimer's disease (N = 6), TDP-43 (N = 6), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (N = 5), hippocampal sclerosis (N = 2), corticobasal degeneration (N = 1), dementia with Lewy bodies (N = 1), and vascular pathology (N = 1); and all would have contributed synergistically to the clinical manifestations. The pathological diagnosis of CTE was established in four individuals according to the latest consensus diagnostic criteria. This finding is probably related to their past prolonged exposure to repetitive head impacts from head-to-player collisions and heading the ball thousands of time throughout their careers. Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies are common concomitant findings in CTE, both of which are increasingly considered as part of the CTE pathological entity in older individuals. Association football is the most popular sport in the world and the potential link between repetitive head impacts from playing football and CTE as indicated from our findings is of considerable public health interest. Clearly, a definitive link cannot be established in this clinico-pathological series, but our findings support the need for further systematic investigation, including large-scale case-control studies to identify at risk groups of footballers which will justify for the implementation of protective strategies.","2017",,"Acta Neuropathol",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Amyloid beta-Peptides, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Autopsy, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Calcium-Binding Proteins, FALSE, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, FALSE, complications, Q000150, DNA-Binding Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Dementia, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Microfilament Proteins, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Retirement, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Sequestosome-1 Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Soccer, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, tau Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed patients seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester by autonomic specialists between 2001 and 2011 and during initial evaluation diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension consistent with PAF (possible PAF). In order to assess for the presence or absence of progression, we identified patients with 3 years or more of in-person follow-up (stable PAF) or documented progression to another synucleinopathy (converters).

METHODS: One hundred patients who presented with pure autonomic failure were recruited at 5 medical centers in the United States. Seventy-four patients agreed to be followed prospectively. Patients underwent clinical evaluations including neurological rating scales, sleep questionnaires, smell test, and sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic function tests.
RESULTS: At enrollment, patients were 68 ± 12 years old (median ± interquartile range) and had had autonomic failure for 5 ± 7 years. Within 4 years of follow-up, 25 of 74 subjects (34%) developed dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 13), Parkinson disease (n = 6), or multiple system atrophy (n = 6). The presence of probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder was strongly associated with the development of a manifest central nervous system (CNS) synucleinopathy (odds ratio = 7.1). Patients who phenoconverted to multiple system atrophy had younger age at onset of autonomic failure, severe bladder/bowel dysfunction, preserved olfaction, and a cardiac chronotropic response upon tilt > 10 beats per minute. Those who phenoconverted to Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies had decreased olfaction, a lesser chronotropic response to tilt, and a longer duration of illness.

It is caused by a severe deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. SMA is characterized by α-lower motor neuron loss and muscle atrophy, however, there is a growing list of tissues impacted by a SMN deficiency beyond motor neurons. The non-neuronal defects are observed in the most severe Type I SMA patients and most of the widely used SMA mouse models, however, as effective therapeutics are developed, it is unclear whether additional symptoms will be uncovered in longer lived patients. Recently, the immune system and inflammation has been identified as a contributor to neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. To determine whether the immune system is comprised in SMA, we analyzed the spleen and immunological components in SMA mice. In this report, we identify: a significant reduction in spleen size in multiple SMA mouse models and a pathological reduction in red pulp and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Additionally, red pulp macrophages, a discrete subset of yolk sac-derived macrophages, were found to be altered in SMA spleens even in pre-symptomatic post-natal day 2 animals. These cells, which are involved in iron metabolism and the phagocytosis of erythrocytes and blood-borne pathogens are significantly reduced prior to the development of the neurodegenerative hallmarks of SMA, implying a differential role of SMN in myeloid cell ontogeny. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SMN deficiency impacts spleen development and suggests a potential role for immunological development in SMA.","2017",,"Hum Mol Genet",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Embryonic Development, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Erythrocytes, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Inflammation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Iron, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Macrophages, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Mice, FALSE, Motor Neurons, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Muscular Atrophy, Spinal, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Myeloid Cells, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Phagocytosis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Spleen, FALSE, growth & development, Q000254, Survival of Motor Neuron 1 Protein, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

All patients received full polysomnography at baseline and were then followed for up to 4.5 years. The prognostic role of sleep apnea was assessed by a Cox model in an univariate analysis and then adjusted on other potential factors.
RESULTS: Analyzable polysomnographic recordings were available for 28 patients. Sleep apnea was found in 11 patients. During follow-up, 15 patients died, including 9 with baseline sleep apnea. In an univariate analysis, sleep apnea, Unified MSA Rating Scale I + II score at baseline and at year one, and disease duration were associated with mortality.

LUTS are common comorbidities associated with both of these neurodegenerative diseases and are likely to impair patients' quality of life. The motor symptoms of PD and MSA often seem similar; however, the pathophysiology, and thus the treatment of LUTS differs considerably. Antimuscarinics are the first-line treatment of storage LUTS in patients with PD or MSA; however, care should be taken in the management of these patients, especially in those with MSA owing to the high risk of inefficient voiding, and thus an increased post-void residual volume. Other treatments of PD-related LUTS include α-adrenoceptor antagonists, which improve voiding dysfunction, transurethral resection of the prostate for bladder outlet obstruction owing to prostate enlargement, and neuromodulation and intradetrusor botulinum toxin injections for storage LUTS. However, more conservative treatments, including intermittent catheterization, are required for LUTS in patients with MSA, owing to the high incidence of impaired detrusor contractility and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.","2017",,"Nat Rev Urol",," review","Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Dopamine Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Humans, FALSE, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Muscarinic Antagonists, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Prevalence, FALSE, Treatment Outcome, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the pre-operative MR imaging and surgical records of 87 patients (87 shoulders) who underwent arthroscopic repair of a large-to-massive rotator cuff tear. Patients were divided into two groups, based on the surgical outcome of the repair. Of the 87 patients, 53 underwent complete repair (Group I) and 34 an incomplete repair (Group II). Pre-operative MR images were reviewed to quantify several variables. Between-group differences were evaluated and multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the predictive value of significant variables. The reparability index (RI) was constructed using the odds ratios of significant variables and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis performed to identify the optimal RI cutoff to differentiate between the two groups.
RESULTS: The following variables were identified as independent predictors of arthroscopic reparability: the size of the defect with medial-lateral diameter (cutoff, 4.2 cm) and anterior-posterior diameter (cutoff, 3.7cm); Patte's grade of muscle atrophy (cutoff, grade 3) and Goutallier grade of fatty degeneration (cutoff, grade 3). An RI cutoff value of 2.5 provided the highest differentiation between groups I and II, with an area under the curve of 0.964, and a sensitivity of 73.5% and specificity of 96.2%.
CONCLUSION: The RI developed in our study may prove to be an efficient clinical scoring system to predict whether a large-to-massive rotator cuff tear is arthroscopically reparable.

To date, there are no approved therapeutics for GA treatment; however, several are in clinical trials.

METHODS: Primary literature search on PubMed for GA, complement cascade in age-related macular degeneration. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for natural history studies in GA and clinical trials of drugs targeting the complement cascade for GA.
RESULTS: Cumulative damage to the retina by aging, environmental stress, and other factors triggers inflammation via multiple pathways, including the complement cascade. When regulatory components in these pathways are compromised, as with several GA-linked genetic risk factors in the complement cascade, chronic inflammation can ultimately lead to the retinal cell death characteristic of GA. Complement inhibition has been identified as a key candidate for therapeutic intervention, and drugs targeting the complement pathway are currently in clinical trials.

METHODS: Twenty-two patients with iRBD, 21 patients with MSA, 22 patients with PD, and 21 normal controls were included in this study. All participants underwent one night of video-polysomnography monitoring, and the sleep parameters were analyzed using Polysmith software and by visual analysis. TCS was performed following a standardized procedure. The echogenicity of the substantia nigra and basal ganglia were evaluated.
RESULTS: A greater proportion of PD patients were found to have substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (86.4%) when compared to iRBD patients (31.8%), MSA patients (23.8%), and normal controls (4.8%) (P < 0.001). Fourteen MSA patients (66.7%) and 11 iRBD patients (50.0%) had hyperechogenicity in the basal ganglia, whereas hyperechogenicity in the basal ganglia was less frequent in PD patients (18.2%) and normal controls (9.5%) (P < 0.001). Poor sleep efficiency, less stage II sleep time, and more periodic leg movements were found in MSA and PD patients, whereas iRBD patients had almost normal sleep.
CONCLUSION: Some iRBD patients had basal ganglia hyperechogenicity that was similar to that observed in MSA, which may represent another possible convert direction.

Age is a major determinant of MS progression onset and disability. Over the past years, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the key drivers of neurodegeneration and disability accumulation in MS. However, the effect of commonly encountered age-related cerebral vessel disease, namely small vessel disease (SVD), has been largely neglected and constitutes the aim of this review. SVD shares some features with MS, that is, white matter demyelination and brain atrophy, and has been shown to contribute to the neuronal damage seen in vascular cognitive impairment. Several lines of evidence suggest that an interaction between MS and SVD may influence MS-related neurodegeneration. SVD may contribute to hypoperfusion, reduced vascular reactivity and tissue hypoxia, features seen in MS. Venule and endothelium abnormalities have been documented in MS but the role of arterioles and of other neurovascular unit structures, such as the pericyte, has not been explored. Vascular risk factors (VRF) have recently been associated with faster progression in MS, though the mechanisms are unclear since very few studies have addressed the impact of VRF and SVD on MS imaging and pathology outcomes.

Aliskiren was administered intragastrically [10 mg/kg body weight (BW)] on day 5 (as a preventive strategy, AP group) or on day 12 (as a therapeutic strategy, AT group) after C26 injection. Mice that received no C26 injection (healthy controls, HC group) or only C26 injection but not aliskiren (cancer, CA group) were used as controls.

Aliskiren significantly alleviated multiple cachexia‑associated symptoms, including BW loss, tumor burden, muscle wasting, muscular dysfunction, and shortened survival.

In addition, early administration of aliskiren before cachexia development (AP group) resulted in more robust effects in alleviating cachexia or targeting underlying mechanisms than administration after cachexia development (AT group). Aliskiren exhibited potent anti‑cachexia activities.

The aim of this study is to examine oxidant biomarkers including homocysteine (Hcys), bilirubin, uric acid, lipids, and potential environmental risk factors and to ascertain whether these data correlate with MSA in a Chinese population.
METHODS: In this study, serum levels of Hcys, bilirubin, uric acid, and lipids were studied in 55 MSA patients and 76 healthy controls (HCs). Education, anti-parkinsonian agent usage, smoking, drinking, farming, and living area of the subjects also were analyzed. The Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS), Hoehn & Yahr stage, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination were used to assess the disease severity, the parkinsonism, ataxia, and the cognitive ability of MSA, respectively.
RESULTS: The levels of Hcys were higher (p<0.001) and those of total bilirubin (p=0.007), indirect bilirubin (p=0.011), and total cholesterol (p=0.046) were lower in MSA patients than in healthy controls, whereas uric acid levels did not differ significantly between MSA and healthy controls. Moreover, Hcys levels in MSA patients had positive correlations with illness duration (r s =0.422, p=0.001) and UMSARS-I (r s =0.555, p<0.001), respectively. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were negatively correlated with UMSARS-I (r s =-0.325, p=0.015). Farming was more frequent in MSA patients (1-20 years: odds ratio, 6.36; p20 years: odds ratio, 10.26; p=0.001), whereas current smoking was less frequent (odds ratio, 0.13, p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Hcys and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be associated with the disease severity of MSA.

These α-synucleinopathies have in common parkinsonism and non-motor features including orthostatic hypotension (OH) and cognitive impairment. However, the nature of the relationship between OH and cognitive impairment is unclear. We therefore systematically reviewed the literature for evidence of an association between OH and cognitive impairment in α-synucleinopathies and discuss possible mechanisms and implications of this relationship. Abstracts from 313 original research articles were surveyed, and a total of 132 articles were considered for this review. Articles were stratified as: 'direct-evidence studies' based on the direct assessment for a relationship between OH and cognitive impairment in α-synucleinopathies, and 'indirect-evidence studies' based on an association being referred to as a secondary outcome. Ten 'direct-evidence papers' were identified, seven of which reported a positive association between OH and cognitive impairment, while seven of 12 'indirect-evidence papers' similarly did as well. The papers that reported no association between OH and cognitive impairment used less sensitive measures of cognition. A relationship between OH and cognitive impairment in patients with α-synucleinopathies exists, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Three hypotheses are proposed: (1) OH and cognitive impairment occur concurrently due to diffuse brain and peripheral deposition of α-synuclein, (2) OH-mediated cerebral hypoperfusion impairs cognition and (3) the two act synergistically to accelerate cognitive decline. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies and clinical trials may help clarify the nature of this relationship.","2016",,"J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry",," review","Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Cognitive Dysfunction, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE, Hypotension, Orthostatic, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Lewy Body Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Mental Status Schedule, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Neuroglia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Statistics as Topic, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients diagnosed with MSA referred to our department beginning in 1991 and evaluated at least yearly during the disease course. Stridor was defined as present when confirmed by a whole night video-polysomnography and as early if presenting within 3 years of disease onset. Survival data, from disease onset to time of death, were calculated with Kaplan-Meier curves. Predictors were identified in univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: We included 136 patients with MSA; 113 were deceased at the time of study. Stridor was diagnosed in 42 patients, and 22 presented early stridor onset. Twelve of the 31 patients treated for stridor received tracheostomy, and 19 received continuous positive airway pressure. Overall survival did not differ between patients with and without stridor, while patients with early stridor onset had a worse prognosis than those developing this symptom later. In the stridor subgroup, early stridor onset was an unfavorable survival predictor. Stridor treatment was significantly associated with survival in our population. The Kaplan-Meier curve did not reveal significant differences in survival between the 2 treatments even though there was a trend toward longer disease duration in patients receiving tracheostomy.

RBD may be the initial manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, gauging the individual risk of subsequent phenoconversion and making assumptions on the type of disease that may subsequently follow RBD is challenging. Over the past years, a growing number of studies have sought to establish reliable neuroimaging markers to detect neurodegenerative brain changes in RBD subjects at the earliest possible stage. The present review summarizes recent advances in brain imaging in RBD and provides recommendations for the application of currently available structural and functional neuroimaging modalities to monitor disease progression and risk of subsequent phenoconversion. Further imaging research applying multimodal approaches is encouraged to enhance accuracy of prognoses. Additionally, more longitudinal studies are warranted to validate findings from cross-sectional studies on RBD progression and risk of subsequent phenoconversion. Aside from enabling reliable prognoses on a single-subject-level in the near future, this might give further insight into RBD pathophysiology, and finally augment the development of intervention strategies and disease-modifying therapies.","2017",,"Sleep Med Rev",,"systematic review","Biomarkers, TRUE, Brain, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Disease Progression, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Neuroimaging, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

All four CHCHD2 exons were Sanger-sequenced in 89 patients with MSA, 424 patients with sporadic ALS and 594 unrelated healthy Han Chinese. Four exonic variants were detected in six patients with sporadic ALS: Pro2Leu (rs142444896), Ala32Thr (rs145190179), Ser85Arg (rs182992574), and Tyr99ArgfsX42 (rs778030300). No exonic variants were detected in patients with MSA.

The efficacy and safety of droxidopa were assessed by determining the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH).
METHODS: Data collected in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic nOH were pooled for efficacy and safety analyses. NNT and NNH were calculated as reciprocals of the risk difference (difference in event rates) for droxidopa versus placebo.
RESULTS: The NNT for droxidopa for improvement in OHSA Item 1 was <10. The NNH for adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation in the pooled studies was 81. The likelihood of being helped or harmed (LHH) calculated from pooled analysis of the NNT for ≥2 units of improvement in OHSA Item 1 score and the NNH for discontinuations due to AEs were 7.8, 8.8, 3.1, and 3.5 for weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 after randomization, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Droxidopa is efficacious for treatment of nOH, with an NNT below 10 and an acceptable tolerability profile with NNH ranging from 23 to 302 in the pooled analysis of frequently occurring AEs. Based on the LHH for the pooled analysis at week 1, droxidopa is 7.8 times more likely than placebo to show a clinical benefit than result in discontinuation because of an AE.

However, practical and readily available methods are lacking. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of acetic acid chromoendoscopy (AAC) for determining the extent of gastric IM.
METHODS: One hundred twenty-six participants were enrolled. The participants underwent screening EGD with 1.5% acetic acid instillation for the detection of acetowhite reaction. Subsequently, targeted biopsies were performed at the 5 standard intra-gastric locations of the updated Sydney system. The accuracy of AAC was calculated using the histology results as a reference. Two endoscopists, each of whom was blinded to the other's result, determined the presence or absence of acetowhite reaction.
RESULTS: The overall diagnostic accuracy of AAC was 89.0%, and the sensitivity and specificity were 77.6% and 94.4%, respectively. The specificity for the gastric body was >94%. The proportion of extensive IM, a strong risk factor for gastric cancer, increased from 0.9% to 18.1% when AAC was used instead of conventional EGD alone (P < .001). Endoscopically determined atrophy had a negative effect on the diagnosis of AAC (odds ratio, 3.012; 95% confidence interval, 1.625-5.583). There was substantial inter- and intra-observer agreement.

A chronic childhood condition can disrupt this transition and create major challenges for both the young person and his or her family. Little is known about families' experiences when living with a rare genetic disease. Therefore, the purpose of this literature review was to understand experiences of families living with a chronic childhood disease during transition into adulthood by integrating evidence.
METHOD: A systematic review using an integrative approach to data inclusion and analysis comprising qualitative, quantitative and other methodological studies about a range of genetic and chronic childhood diseases was undertaken to identify relevant information. Databases searched were PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and AMED, using the search terms (1) family, caregivers, young adult, adolescent; (2) adolescent development, transitional programs, transition to adult care; (3) muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis, haemophilia and sickle cell disease. Study findings were critically appraised and analyzed using critical interpretive synthesis.
RESULTS: A total of 8116 citations were retrieved. 33 studies remained following the removal of duplicates, papers unrelated to genetic childhood conditions and families' experiences of the transition into adulthood. Findings provided three perspectives: (1) the young person's perspective on how to ""live a normal life in an extraordinary way"" and ""manage a chronic and life threatening disease""; (2) the parent perspective on the ""complexity of being a parent of a chronically ill child"" and ""concerns about the child's future"" and (3) the sibling perspective on ""concerns about the siblings future"". As a consequence of the genetic childhood condition, during the ill family members' transition into adulthood all family members were at risk for psychosocial difficulties as they mutually influenced each other. Previous research focused predominately on the individual illness experience, and less emphasis was put on the family perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Young people and their family members experienced multiple challenges and not only for the ill individual but also there were consequences and health risks for the whole family system.

In this study, we aimed to measure both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) levels in patients with ALS, and determine if there is a correlation. We also evaluated plasma and CSF pNF-H levels to investigate if this biomarker could predict the time to generalization (TTG) in ALS better.
METHODS: Paired plasma and CSF pNF-H levels of patients with ALS (n=51), multiple system atrophy (n=12) and controls (n=30) were measured by monoclonal sandwich ELISA. TTG, which also indicates the time of symptoms spreading from spinal or bulbar localization to both, was evaluated in all ALS patients.
RESULTS: We found a strong correlation between plasma and CSF pNF-H levels within individual patients (r=0.712, p<0.001).

METHODS: A rationale is adopted, to incorporate selected clinical data and results from animal-model research, complementing epidemiologic evidences reported in two prior articles.
FINDINGS: Theory is formulated assuming an underlying conformational transmission mechanism, mediated either by horizontal transfer of mammalian genes coding for specific aggregation-prone proteins, or by xeno-templating between bacterial and host proteins. We build a few population-based and experimentally-testable hypotheses focusing on: (1) non-disposable surgical instruments for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and other rapid progressive neurodegenerative dementia (sRPNDd), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and motor neuron disease (MND); and (2) specific bacterial infections such as B. pertussis and E. coli for all forms, but particularly for late-life sporadic conformational, NDDs, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherosclerosis where natural protein fibrils present in such organisms as a result of adaptation to the human host induce prion-like mechanisms.

MSA was originally considered exclusively sporadic but reports of association with genes such as SNCA, COQ2 and LRRK2 have demonstrated that there is a genetic contribution to the disease. MAPT has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and we previously reported a protective association of the MAPT H2 haplotype with MSA in 61 pathologically confirmed cases.
METHODS: In the present study, we assessed the full MAPT haplotype diversity in MSA patients using six MAPT tagging SNPs. We genotyped a total of 127 pathologically confirmed MSA cases, 86 patients with clinically diagnosed MSA and 1312 controls.
RESULTS: We identified four significant association signals in our pathologically confirmed cases, two from the protective haplotypes H2 (MSA:16.2%,
CONTROLS: 0.9%, p = 0.021). We evaluated the association of MSA subtypes with the common protective H2 haplotype and found a significant difference with controls for MSA patients with some degree of MSA-C (MSA-C or MSA-mixed), for whom H2 occurred in only 8.6% of patients in our pathologically confirmed series (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide further evidence that MAPT variation is associated with risk of MSA. Interestingly, our results suggest a greater effect size in the MSA-C compared to MSA-P for H2. Additional genetic studies in larger pathologically confirmed MSA series and meta-analytic studies will be needed to fully assess the role of MAPT and other genes in MSA.","2016",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, TRUE, Genotype, FALSE, Haplotypes, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Risk, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, tau Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

MSA patients show various phenotypes during the course of their illness including parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, autonomic failure, and pyramidal signs. MSA is classified into the parkinsonian (MSA-P) or cerebellar (MSA-C) variant depending on the clinical motor phenotype at presentation. MSA-P and MSA-C are predominant in Western countries and Japan, respectively. The mean age at onset is 55 to 60 years. Prognosis ranges from 6 to 10 years, but some cases survive for more than 15 years. Early and severe autonomic failure is a poor prognostic factor. MSA patients sometimes present with isolated autonomic failure or motor symptoms/signs, and the median duration from onset to the concomitant appearance of motor and autonomic symptoms was approximately 2 years in our previous study. As the presence of the combination of motor and autonomic symptoms is essential for the current diagnostic criteria, early diagnosis is difficult when patients present with isolated autonomic failure or motor symptoms/signs. We experienced MSA patients who died before presentation of the motor symptoms/signs diagnostic for MSA (i.e., premotor MSA). Detection of the nature of autonomic failure consistent with MSA and identification of the dysfunctional anatomical sites may increase the probability of a diagnosis of premotor MSA. Dementia is another problem in MSA. Although dementia had been thought to be rare in MSA, frontal lobe dysfunction is observed frequently during the early course of the illness. Magnetic resonance imaging can show progressive cerebral atrophy in longstanding cases. More recently, MSA patients presenting with frontotemporal dementia preceding the presence of motor and autonomic manifestations diagnostic of MSA have been reported. Novel diagnostic criteria based on an expanding concept of the clinical conditions and symptoms of MSA will be needed for the development of disease-modifying therapies and better management.","2016",,"Rinsho Shinkeigaku",," review","Ataxia, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Atrophy, FALSE, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Death, Sudden, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Early Diagnosis, FALSE, Frontal Lobe, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Frontotemporal Dementia, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Humans, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, TRUE, classification, Q000145",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

For these reasons many biomarkers are under investigation to support the diagnosis at the early stage. The neuropathological hallmark of PD is represented by Lewy bodies (LBs), which are intracytoplasmic inclusions in substantia nigra neurons. The major component of LBs, α-synuclein (α-syn), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD and in other 'synucleinopathies' such as multisystem atrophy (MSA) and dementia with LBs (DLBs). Several studies have investigated this presynaptic protein as a potential biomarker of PD.

RECENT FINDINGS: In terms of genetics, in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration new risk loci have been identified but also their possible association to disease pathogenesis. In multiple system atrophy, there is still a debate as to whether COQ2 variants are associated with disease, at least in non-Asian population, whereas at the same time evidence of coenzyme Q10 deficiency in serum and brains of MSA patients has been reported. In terms of pathogenesis, the 'prion' hypothesis has prevailed in the last years in the literature, and the first clinical studies based on such disease mechanisms are already in phase I. Despite all these discoveries, clinical diagnosis still remains poor, and phenotypic variability is reported much higher than previously thought. A plethora of studies testing possible neuroprotective agents are currently ongoing.

Early AMD is characterized by the appearance of soft drusen, as well as pigmentary changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). These soft, confluent drusen can progress into two forms of advanced AMD: geographic atrophy (GA, or dry AMD) or choroidal neovascularization (CNV, or wet AMD). Both forms of AMD result in a similar clinical progression in terms of loss of central vision. The exact mechanism for developing early AMD, as well as triggers responsible for progressing to advanced stage of disease, is still largely unknown. However, significant evidence exists demonstrating a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors as causes of AMD progression. Multiple genes and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found associated with AMD, including various genes involved in the complement pathway, lipid metabolism and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Of the known genetic contributors to disease risk, the CFH Y402H and HTRA1/ARMS polymorphisms contribute to more than 50% of the genetic risk for AMD. Environmentally, oxidative stress plays a critical role in many aging diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and AMD. Due to the exposure to sunlight and high oxygen concentration, the oxidative stress burden is higher in the eye than other tissues, which can be further complicated by additional oxidative stressors such as smoking. Increasingly, evidence is accumulating suggesting that functional abnormalities of the innate immune system incurred via high risk genotypes may be contributing to the pathogenesis of AMD by altering the inflammatory homeostasis in the eye, specifically in the handling of oxidation products. As the eye in non-pathological instances maintains a low level of inflammation despite the presence of a relative abundance of potentially inflammatory molecules, we have previously hypothesized that the tight homeostatic control of inflammation via the innate immune system is likely critical for avoidance of disease progression. However, the presence of a multitude of potential triggers of inflammation results in a sensitive balance in which perturbations thereof would subsequently alter the inflammatory state of the retina, leading to a state of chronic inflammation and pathologic progression. In this review, we will highlight the background literature surrounding the known genetic and environmental contributors to AMD risk, as well as a discussion of the potential mechanistic interplay of these factors that lead to disease pathogenesis with particular emphasis on the delicate control of inflammatory homeostasis and the centrality of the innate immune system in this process.","2016",,"AIMS Mol Sci",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Considering the overlap of the clinical manifestations and pathological characteristics of ET, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we explored the possible genetic association of rs3794087 with ET, PD, MSA and ALS in a Chinese cohort.
METHODS: A total of 112 ET, 621 PD, 356 MSA, 513 sporadic ALS (SALS) patients and 437 healthy controls (HCs) were genotyped for rs3794087 using the Sequenom iPLEX Assay technology.
RESULTS: Significant association was found between SLC1A2 rs3794087 and PD in the additive model (p=0.006), which was more obvious in early onset PD. The minor allele of rs3794087 decreased the risk for early onset PD (p=0.011, OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56-0.94). However, no significant differences in the genotype distributions and allele frequency were observed in the allelic, additive, dominant or recessive genetic models of SLC1A2 rs3794087 between ET patients and HCs, between SALS patients and HCs, and between MSA and HCs.

However, the mechanisms of cancer cachexia remain poorly understood. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress. The ER responds to this stress through activating certain pathways commonly known as the unfolding protein response (UPR). The main function of UPR is to restore homeostasis, but excessive or prolonged activation of UPR can lead to pathologic conditions. In this study, we examined the role of ER stress and UPR in regulation of skeletal muscle mass in naïve conditions and during cancer cachexia. Our results demonstrate that multiple markers of ER stress are highly activated in skeletal muscle of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and Apc(Min/+) mouse models of cancer cachexia. Treatment of mice with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a chemical chaperon and a potent inhibitor of ER stress, significantly reduced skeletal muscle strength and mass in both control and LLC-bearing mice. Blocking the UPR also increased the proportion of fast-type fibers in soleus muscle of both control and LLC-bearing mice. Inhibition of UPR reduced the activity of Akt/mTOR pathway and increased the expression of the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy in LLC-bearing mice. Moreover, we found that the inhibition of UPR causes severe atrophy in cultured myotubes. Our study provides initial evidence that ER stress and UPR pathways are essential for maintaining skeletal muscle mass and strength and for protection against cancer cachexia.-Bohnert, K.

Similar GI dysmotility has been identified in mouse models with survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein deficiency. We previously described vascular defects in skeletal muscle and spinal cord of SMA mice and we hypothesized that similar defects could be involved in the GI pathology observed in these mice. We therefore investigated the gross anatomical structure, enteric vasculature and neurons in the small intestine in a severe mouse model of SMA. We also assessed the therapeutic response of GI histopathology to systemic administration of morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (AON) designed to increase SMN protein expression. Significant anatomical and histopathological abnormalities, with striking reduction of vascular density, overabundance of enteric neurons and increased macrophage infiltration, were detected in the small intestine in SMA mice. After systemic AON treatment in neonatal mice, all the abnormalities observed were significantly restored to near-normal levels. We conclude that the observed GI histopathological phenotypes and functional defects observed in these SMA mice are strongly linked to SMN deficiency which can be rescued by systemic administration of AON.

Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible if the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family. Biochemical testing is not accurate or reliable for carrier determination. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible using molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family, or using biochemical testing (either measurement of 4-hydroxybutyric acid in amniotic fluid or assay of SSADH enzyme activity in chorionic villus tissue and cultured amniocytes).","2004",,"GeneReviews<sup>®</sup>",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

An improved understanding of this breathing disorder is essential since nocturnal stridor carries a poor prognosis (an increased risk of sudden death). In this study, we aimed to classify types of stridor by sound analysis and to reveal their clinical significance. Patients who met the criteria for probable MSA and had undergone polysomnography (PSG) were recruited. Patients were then assessed clinically with sleep questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Nocturnal stridor and snoring were analyzed with the Multi-Dimensional Voice Program. Nocturnal stridor was recorded in 22 patients and snoring in 18 patients using the PSG. Waveforms of stridors were classified into rhythmic or semirhythmic after analysis of the oscillogram. Formants and harmonics were observed in both types of stridor, but not in snoring. Of the 22 patients diagnosed with stridor during the present study, fifteen have subsequently died, with the time to death after the PSG study being 1.9 ± 1.4 years (range 0.8 to 5.0 years). The rhythmic waveform group presented higher scores on the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the survival outcome of this group was lower compared to the semirhythmic waveform group (p = 0.030, p = 0.014). In the Kaplan Meier's survival curve, the outcome of patients with rhythmic waveform was significantly less favorable than the outcome of patients with semirhythmic waveform (log-rank test, p < 0.001).

To date, there is no effective disease modifying therapy. Previous experiments have shown that the aggregation inhibitor anle138b reduces neurodegeneration, as well as behavioral deficits in both transgenic and toxin mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we analyzed whether anle138b improves motor skills and reduces neuronal loss, as well as oligodendroglial α-syn aggregation in the PLP-α-syn transgenic mouse challenged with the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) to model full-blown MSA. Following 1 month of treatment with anle138b, MSA mice showed signs of motor improvement affecting stride length, but not pole, grip strength, and beam test performance. Loss of dopaminergic nigral neurons and Purkinje cells was not attenuated and GCI density remained unchanged. These data suggest that the pathology in transgenic PLP-α-syn mice receiving 3-NP might be too advanced to detect significant effects of anle138b treatment on neuronal loss and intracytoplasmic α-syn inclusion bodies. However, the partial motor amelioration may indicate potential efficacy of anle138b treatment that may be mediated by its actions on α-syn oligomers or may reflect improvement of neuronal dysfunction in neural at risk populations.

Thus, diagnosis of IRBD needs to be accurate and involves informing the patient of the risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease. It is extraordinary for a sleep disorder to precede the full expression of a neurodegenerative disease, which renders IRBD of particular interest in studies of the prodromal stage of the synucleinopathies, and in the development of neuroprotective interventions to stop or slow neurodegenerative deterioration before motor and cognitive symptomatology emerges.

This makes the pathological pathway(s) in MSA unique in that oligodendrocytes are involved rather than predominantly neurons, as is most other neurodegenerative disorders. MSA is therefore regarded as an oligodendrogliopathy. The etiology of MSA is unknown. No definitive risk factors have been identified, although α-synuclein and other genes have been variably linked to MSA risk. Utilization of postmortem brain tissues has greatly advanced our understanding of GCI pathology and the subsequent neurodegeneration. However, extrapolating the early pathogenesis of MSA from such resource has been difficult and limiting. In recent years, cell and animal models developed for MSA have been instrumental in delineating unique MSA pathological pathways, as well as aiding in clinical phenotyping. The purpose of this review is to bring together and discuss various animal models that have been developed for MSA and how they have advanced our understanding of MSA pathogenesis, particularly the dynamics of α-synuclein aggregation.

METHOD: An optimized immunoassay was used to analyze CSF Ng in a retrospective cohort of 331 participants with different neurodegenerative diseases, including healthy controls (n = 19), biomarker-proven Alzheimer disease (AD) (n = 100), genetic AD (n = 2), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 20), speech variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 21), Lewy body dementia (n = 13), Parkinson disease (n = 31), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 46), multiple system atrophy (n = 29), as well as a heterogeneous group with non-neurodegenerative cognitive impairment (n = 50). CSF Ng concentrations and correlations of CSF Ng with total tau, phosphorylated tau, and β-amyloid 42 concentrations, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and disease duration in the different groups were investigated.
RESULTS: Median CSF Ng concentration was higher in patients with AD compared to both controls (p < 0.001) and all other disease groups (all p < 0.001) except speech variant frontotemporal dementia.

Although motor neurons (MNs) are the most obviously affected cells in SMA, recent evidence suggest dysfunction in multiple cell types. Astrocytes are a crucial component of the motor circuit and are intimately involved with MN health and maintenance. We have previously shown that SMA astrocytes are altered both morphologically and functionally early in disease progression, though it is unclear what causes astrocytes to become reactive. Oxidative stress is a common feature among neurodegenerative diseases. Oxidative stress can both induce apoptosis in neurons and can cause astrocytes to become reactive, which are features observed in the SMA induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cultures. Therefore, we asked if oxidative stress contributes to SMA astrocyte pathology. We examined mitochondrial bioenergetics, transcript and protein levels of oxidative and anti-oxidant factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and found little evidence of oxidative stress. We did observe a significant increase in endogenous catalase expression in SMA iPSCs. While catalase knockdown in SMA iPSCs increased ROS production above basal levels, levels of ROS remained lower than in controls, further arguing against robust oxidative stress in this system. Viral delivery of survival motor neuron (SMN) reversed astrocyte activation and restored catalase levels to normal, without changing mitochondrial respiration or expression of oxidative stress markers.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a unique role in the diagnosis and management of patients with MS. In recent years, there have been considerable changes in the diagnostic criteria for MS as MRI-based studies have demonstrated their power in the earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, MRI metrics have become key supportive outcome measures for evaluating the efficacy of experimental treatments in randomized controlled trials. MRI can also be used as a prognostic tool in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Conventional MR techniques including proton density, T1/T2-weighted images, and FLAIR sequences are now accepted in standard protocols for diagnostic and treatment outcome measures in clinical trials for MS. Radiological features may show a similarity between radiologically isolated syndrome and MS. Approximately two-thirds of individuals with RIS exhibit radiological progression and one-third develop neurological symptoms during mean follow-up times of up to five years. However, a current challenge in the global application of established criteria for RIS involves the accurate classification of subjects with incidentally identified anomalies that are highly characteristic of MS, in comparison to those categorized in medical parlance as possessing ""unidentified bright objects"" or nonspecific T2-hyperintensities, which are commonly identified in patients with migraine headache who fulfill the spatial dissemination requirements for MS. The need for systematically acquired data for improvements in the classification of radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) and the generation of risk algorithms are critically important, providing a basis for scientifically supported management and most importantly, minimizing the number of improperly classified subjects exposed to unnecessary medical testing, MS treatments, and psychological harm. In addition, brain atrophy is a common finding that can now be quantitatively assessed by MR volumetric measures. Further, integrated strategies that combine MRI and clinical markers in scoring systems have provided a potentially useful approach for the management of patients with MS.","2015",,"Noro Psikiyatr Ars",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"
,"26609158","Human Umbilical Tissue-Derived Cells Promote Synapse Formation and Neurite Outgrowth via Thrombospondin Family Proteins.","Koh S","UNLABELLED: Cell therapy demonstrates great potential for the treatment of neurological disorders. Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTCs) were previously shown to have protective and regenerative effects in animal models of stroke and retinal degeneration, but the underlying therapeutic mechanisms are unknown. Because synaptic dysfunction, synapse loss, degeneration of neuronal processes, and neuronal death are hallmarks of neurological diseases and retinal degenerations, we tested whether hUTCs contribute to tissue repair and regeneration by stimulating synapse formation, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival. To do so, we used a purified rat retinal ganglion cell culture system and found that hUTCs secrete factors that strongly promote excitatory synaptic connectivity and enhance neuronal survival. Additionally, we demonstrated that hUTCs support neurite outgrowth under normal culture conditions and in the presence of the growth-inhibitory proteins chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, myelin basic protein, or Nogo-A (reticulon 4). Furthermore, through biochemical fractionation and pharmacology, we identified the major hUTC-secreted synaptogenic factors as the thrombospondin family proteins (TSPs), TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4. Silencing TSP expression in hUTCs, using small RNA interference, eliminated both the synaptogenic function of these cells and their ability to promote neurite outgrowth. However, the majority of the prosurvival functions of hUTC-conditioned media was spared after TSP knockdown, indicating that hUTCs secrete additional neurotrophic factors. Together, our findings demonstrate that hUTCs affect multiple aspects of neuronal health and connectivity through secreted factors, and each of these paracrine effects may individually contribute to the therapeutic function of these cells.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTC) are currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration. These cells show great promise for the treatment of neurological disorders; however, the therapeutic effects of these cells on CNS neurons are not fully understood. Here we provide compelling evidence that hUTCs secrete multiple factors that work synergistically to enhance synapse formation and function, and support neuronal growth and survival. Moreover, we identified thrombospondins (TSPs) as the hUTC-secreted factors that mediate the synaptogenic and growth-promoting functions of these cells. Our findings highlight novel paracrine effects of hUTC on CNS neuron health and connectivity and begin to unravel potential therapeutic mechanisms by which these cells elicit their effects.","2015",,"J Neurosci",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Cell Survival, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cells, Cultured, FALSE, Coculture Techniques, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Culture Media, Conditioned, FALSE, Female, FALSE, HEK293 Cells, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neurites, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurogenesis, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Synapses, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Thrombospondins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Umbilical Cord, FALSE, cytology, Q000166",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

This led us to explore whether the same polymorphism is associated with MSA in Han Chinese and more broadly in East Asians. We conducted a case-control study with 82 Han Chinese with probable MSA and 484 gender- and age-matched healthy subjects, genotyping them using the ligase detection reaction. The results were meta-analyzed together with data from four previous studies to gain a broader picture of possible disease associations in East Asian populations. The COQ2 variants M78V and R337X were not detected in our Han Chinese patients or controls; only the heterozygous V393A variant (CT genotype) was detected. The frequency of this genotype was significantly higher in patients (7.3%) than in controls (1.86%; OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.44-12.04, p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis among patients showed a significant association of V393A with MSA involving cerebellar signs (MSA-C; OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.36-15.48, p = 0.007), but not with MSA involving parkinsonism (MSA-P). Meta-analysis of our results in Han Chinese with data from case-control studies in Japan, Korea, mainland China and Taiwan showed a significant association of V393A with MSA (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.29-3.25, p = 0.002), which subgroup analysis showed to be significant for MSA-C (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.98-3.84, p < 0.001) but not for MSA-P (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.64-2.46, p = 0.51). These findings provide evidence that the previously reported association of COQ2 V393A polymorphism with increased risk of MSA in Japanese also applies to Han Chinese, as well as more broadly to other East Asian populations.

Although MSA typically occurs sporadically, rare pathology-proven MSA families following either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant patterns have been described, indicating a heritable contribution to the pathogenesis.
METHODS: We used Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) to estimate the heritable component of MSA due to common coding variability in imputed genotype data of 907 MSA cases and 3866 population-matched controls. GCTA only assesses the effect of putative causal variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with all common SNPs on the genotyping platform.
RESULTS: We estimate the heritability among common variants of MSA in pooled cases at 2.09-6.65%, with a wider range of values in geographic and diagnostic subgroups. Meta-analysis of our geographic cohorts reveals high between-group heterogeneity. Contributions of single chromosomes are generally negligible. We suggest that all calculated MSA heritability among common variants could be explained by the presence of misdiagnosed cases in the clinical subgroup based on a Bayesian estimate using literature-derived rates of misdiagnosis.
DISCUSSION: MSA is a challenging disease to study due to high rates of misdiagnosis and low prevalence. Given our low estimates of heritability, common genetic variation appears to play a less prominent role in risk for MSA than in other complex neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The success of future gene discovery efforts rests on large pathologically-confirmed case series and an interrogation of both common and rare genetic variants.","2016",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord",,"other","Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Genome-Wide Association Study, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Linkage Disequilibrium, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

This review considers the possibility that urinary dysfunction may precede diagnosis of neurological disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur early in multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and may present before neurological diagnosis. Some people present with LUTS and subsequently are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or a spinal condition. In male LUTS, the symptoms could reflect early stages of a neurological disease, which has not yet been diagnosed ('occult neurology'). Key symptoms include erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, enuresis, loss of filling sensation or unexplained stress urinary incontinence. Directed questioning should enquire about visual symptoms, back pain, anosmia, bowel dysfunction and incontinence, or memory loss. Examination features can include resting tremor, 'croaky' speech, abnormal gait, orthostatic hypotension, ataxia, or altered perineal sensation. Imaging, such as MRI scan, should only be requested after expert neurological examination, to ensure the correct parts of the central nervous system are scanned with appropriate radiological protocols.

METHODS: The shape and threshold of pure-tone audiograms were evaluated for MSA-C (n = 47; mean (± SD) age, 61.6 ± 8.9 years), CCA (n = 16; 62.8 ± 9.5 years), and age-matched controls (n = 169; 62.5 ± 10.7 years). To differentiate specific hearing loss for MSA-C and CCA from presbycusis, the shape of audiograms was examined based on previously established audiological criteria.

In this study, we aimed at delineating the clinicopathological features of the ESGDA and cyst formation of the esophageal submucosal gland duct (ESGD), as well as their correlations and clinical implications. We identified three cases of ESGDA and 16 cases of cyst formation of the ESGD among 786 endoscopic mucosal resection specimens over a 7-year period. The median patient age was 58 years with a male predominance. These lesions were small submucosal bulges locating at the lower esophagus with a size no more than 1 cm. The main microscopic changes of these lesions included content retention, multilayered epithelium or papillary folds of the ESGD and inflammatory cell infiltration, acidophilic degeneration, hyperplasia or atrophy of the acini. The included cases generally showed moderate to severe microscopic esophagitis. The ESGDA was mainly consisted by multiple glandular cysts covered by two layers of cells. Immunohistochemical results showed that the luminal duct lining cells and basal cells were positive for CK7 and p63, respectively. Both of the two layer cells were positive for HMWCK and negative for CK20, p53, CDX2, MUC5AC, MUC6, MUC2 and MUC1. The proliferation index was very low (1%).

CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was an 86-year-old woman with multiple system atrophy, cerebral infarction, and disuse syndrome. She was admitted to our hospital with a recurrent sigmoid volvulus. Since surgery was considered high-risk, percutaneous endoscopic sigmoidopexy with fixation to the abdominal wall was indicated.
DISCUSSION: Percutaneous endoscopic sigmoidopexy was performed for this high-risk case with recurrent sigmoid volvulus. This procedure is advantageous in that suture removal is not necessary because the fixation sutures are buried subcutaneously. Reviewing the relevant literature, we believe that this is the first case of percutaneous endoscopic sigmoidopexy using abdominal wall fixation with buried sutures.

METHODS: From 2001 to 2014, 18 MSA patients (13 males and 5 females, 52-76 years) underwent tracheostomy (TR, n = 11) or laryngeal closure (LC, n = 12). Five patients underwent LC following TR. Vocal fold impairment, the degree of dysphagia and pre/post-operative oral ingestion, and postoperative survival time were evaluated retrospectively. Swallowing function was assessed using the penetration aspiration scale (PAS).
RESULTS: TR was performed due to respiratory disorder in seven patients and due to dysphagia in four patients. PAS scores ranged 1-8 in TR patients and 7-8 in LC patients. Seven of 11 patients who underwent TR displayed worsened PAS scores, and no patients displayed improved PAS scores following TR. All patients who underwent LC regained complete or partial oral intake after surgery. There were no significant differences in postoperative survival time between the two groups.

,"26486929","Sodium channel blockers for neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis.","Yang C","BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which can occur in many parts of the CNS and result in a wide range of symptoms including sensory impairment, fatigue, walking or balance problems, visual impairment, vertigo and cognitive disabilities. At present, the most commonly used MS treatments are immunomodulating agents, but they have little effect on the disability. Experimental studies show that sodium (Na(+)) accumulation leads to intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) release, and the increased calcium levels can activate nitric oxide synthase and harmful proteases and lipases. These factors contribute to axonal injury in people with MS. If partial blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels could result in neuroprotection, this would be of benefit for preventing disability progression in these people. Neuroprotection is emerging as a potentially important strategy for preventing disability progression in people with MS.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of sodium channel blockers for neuroprotection in people with MS to prevent the occurrence of disability and alleviate the burden of the disease.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (27 August 2015) which, among other sources, contains references from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue (8), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2015), EMBASE (1974 to August 2015), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1981 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (ICTRP) search portal (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch). In addition, we searched four Chinese databases, ongoing trials registers and relevant reference lists.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined sodium channel blockers used alone or as an add-on to any approved treatments for MS.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.
MAIN RESULTS: Only one study evaluating lamotrigine in secondary progressive MS was eligible. One hundred and twenty people were included, 61 randomly assigned to lamotrigine treatment and 59 to placebo treatment. The average age of participants in the two groups was 51.9 years and 50.1 years, respectively. The proportion of male participants was 27.5%. The period of follow-up was 2 years. No data were found on disability progression and people who experienced relapses. No significant differences were found for serious adverse events between the two groups. Treatment with lamotrigine was associated with more rashes (20% vs 5%, P value 0.03) and transient, dose-related deterioration of mobility (66% vs 34%, P value 0.001) than placebo. Furthermore, no significant difference between the two groups was found in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of cerebral atrophy, Expanded Disability Status Score changes, Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite score changes. This study was judged to be at high risk of bias. This review will be updated when the three ongoing studies we identified are completed.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of evidence was judged to be very low due to the low number of available studies and included participants. There is a lack of evidence to address the review question on the efficacy of sodium channel blockers for people with MS. Assessment of the three ongoing trials might change this conclusion. Further high-quality large scale studies are needed.

Twelve patients had definite MSA-C, 53 had possible/probable MSA-C, and 12 had ILOCA. Autonomic features, specifically urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence with erectile dysfunction in males, differentiated MSA-C from ILOCA throughout the disease course (p = 0.005). Orthostatic hypotension developed later and differentiated MSA-C from ILOCA (p < 0.01). REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) occurred early in possible/probable MSA-C (p < 0.01). Late MSA-C included pathologic laughing and crying (PLC, p < 0.01), bradykinesia (p = 0.01), and corticospinal findings (p = 0.01).

Its pathology is primarily subcortical comprising vacuolation, neuronal loss, gliosis, and α-synucleinimmunoreactive glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI). To quantify cerebellar pathology in MSA, the density and spatial pattern of the pathological changes were studied in α-synuclein-immunolabelled sections of the cerebellar hemisphere in 10 MSA and 10 control cases. In MSA, densities of Purkinje cells (PC) were decreased and vacuoles in the granule cell layer (GL) increased compared with controls. In six MSA cases, GCI were present in cerebellar white matter. In the molecular layer (ML) and GL of MSA, vacuoles were clustered, the clusters exhibiting a regular distribution parallel to the edge of the folia. Purkinje cells were randomly or regularly distributed with large gaps between surviving cells. Densities of glial cells and surviving neurons in the ML and surviving cells and vacuoles in the GL were negatively correlated consistent with gliosis and vacuolation in response to neuronal loss. Principal components analysis (PCA) suggested vacuole densities in the ML and vacuole density and cell losses in the GL were the main source of neuropathological variation among cases. The data suggest that: (1) cell losses and vacuolation of the GCL and loss of PC were the most significant pathological changes in the cases studied, (2) pathological changes were topographically distributed, and (3) cerebellar pathology could influence cerebral function in MSA via the cerebello-dentato-thalamic tract.","2015",,"Folia Neuropathol",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cerebellum, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Approximately 40% of patients with PD, most patients with MSA, and all patients with PAF have neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH). This study compared long-term survival in these synucleinopathies.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, survival data were obtained for 97.6% of 206 referred patients evaluated between 1994 and 2014 (47 PD + OH, 54 PD no OH, 15 cerebellar MSA [MSA-C], 57 parkinsonian MSA [MSA-P], 28 PAF). Individual diagnoses were confirmed by clinical criteria and results of pharmacologic, neurochemical, and neuroimaging tests of sympathetic noradrenergic innervation. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) from symptom onset and from time of evaluation to death.
RESULTS: Patients with MSA-C or MSA-P had shorter survival from symptom onset than did patients with PD + OH (age- and sex-adjusted HR = 6.1, 5.6; p < 0.0001 each), PAF (HR = 10.8, 9.9; p < 0.0001 each) or PD no OH (HR = 14.9, 13.6; p < 0.0001 each).

The CACNA1C gene codes for a subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which modulate amygdala function. Although CACNA1C genotype appears to be associated with amygdala morphology and function in adults with and without psychopathology, whether genetic variation influences amygdala structure and function earlier in development has not been examined.
METHODS: In this first investigation of the neural correlates of CACNA1C in young individuals, we examined associations between two single nucleotide polymorphisms in CACNA1C (rs1006737 and rs4765914) with amygdala volume and activation during an emotional processing task in 58 adolescents and young adults 13-20 years of age.
RESULTS: Minor (T) allele carriers of rs4765914 exhibited smaller amygdala volume than major (C) allele homozygotes (β=-0.33, p=0.006). Furthermore, minor (A) allele homozygotes of rs1006737 exhibited increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the amygdala when viewing negative (vs. neutral) stimuli (β=0.29, p=0.040) and decreased BOLD signal in the amygdala when instructed to downregulate their emotional response to negative stimuli (β=-0.38, p=0.009). Follow-up analyses indicated that childhood trauma did not moderate the associations of CACNA1C variation with amygdala structure and function (ps>0.170).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that CACNA1C-related differences in amygdala structure and function are present by adolescence. However, population stratification is a concern, given the racial/ethnic heterogeneity of our sample, and our findings do not have direct clinical implications currently. Nevertheless, these results suggest that developmentally informed research can begin to shed light on the time course by which genetic liability may translate into neural differences associated with vulnerability to psychopathology.","2015",,"J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol"," OBJECTIVE : Genome-wide association studies have identified allelic variation in CACNA1C as a risk factor for multiple psychiatric disorders associated with limbic system dysfunction , including bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , and depression ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Alleles, FALSE, Amygdala, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Atrophy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Calcium Channels, L-Type, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Emotions, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Female, FALSE, Functional Neuroimaging, FALSE, Genome-Wide Association Study, FALSE, Homozygote, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, TRUE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Recent innovations and advances in spinal surgery have revolutionized the management of spinal deformities in elderly patients. However, spinal deformity surgeries in patients with Parkinson disease remain challenging. High rates of mechanical complications can necessitate revision surgery.

There are differing reports on the influence of certain clinical features, including motor subtype (multiple system atrophy-parkinsonism versus multiple system atrophy-cerebellar ataxia), age of onset, gender, and early autonomic symptoms, on the survival in patients with multiple system atrophy. We sought to evaluate overall survival and predictors of survival in a large cohort of patients with multiple system atrophy seen at a single referral centre where objective autonomic testing is routinely performed for this indication. All cases of multiple system atrophy evaluated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester and assessed with an autonomic reflex screen between January 1998 and December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 685 patients were identified; 594 met criteria for probable multiple system atrophy, and 91 for possible multiple system atrophy. Multiple system atrophy-parkinsonism was the predominant subtype in 430 patients (63%). Average age of onset was earlier in multiple system atrophy-cerebellar ataxia (58.4 years) compared to multiple system atrophy-parkinsonism (62.3 years; P < 0.001). Median disease duration from symptom onset to death was 7.51 years (95% confidence interval 7.18-7.78) while time from diagnosis to death was 3.33 years (95% confidence interval 2.92-3.59). There was no difference in survival between motor subtypes of multiple system atrophy (P = 0.232). An initial motor symptom was most common (61%) followed by autonomic onset (28%) and combined motor and autonomic symptoms (11%). The initial onset of either motor or autonomic symptoms did not influence length of survival. However, a number of clinical and autonomic laboratory features predicted unfavourable survival in a univariate analysis. A multivariate model retained the following unfavourable predictors of survival: (i) falls within 3 years of onset (hazard ratio 2.31, P < 0.0001); (ii) bladder symptoms (hazard ratio 1.96, P < 0.0001); (iii) urinary catheterization within 3 years of symptom onset (hazard ratio 1.67, P < 0.003); (iv) orthostatic intolerance within 1 year of symptom onset (hazard ratio 1.28, P < 0.014); (v) older age of onset (hazard ratio 1.02, P = 0.001); and (vi) degree of autonomic failure as measured by a validated composite autonomic severity score (hazard ratio 1.07, P < 0.0023). We conclude that carefully selected clinical features can be used to predict survival in patients with multiple system atrophy.

Importantly, these metabolic alterations have been shown to contribute to disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine if reduced insulin sensitivity is also present in other α-synucleinopathies associated with autonomic failure.
METHODS: We studied 19 patients with multiple system atrophy and 26 patients with pure autonomic failure. For comparison, we studied 8 healthy controls matched for body mass index. Insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were calculated using fasting glucose and insulin levels according to the homeostatic model assessment 2. A multiple linear regression model was performed to determine factors that predict insulin sensitivity in autonomic failure.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in insulin sensitivity among groups (P = 0.048). This difference was due to lower insulin sensitivity in multiple system atrophy patients: 64% [interquartile range (IQR), 43 to 117] compared to healthy controls 139% (IQR, 83 to 212), P = 0.032. The main factor that contributed to the reduced insulin sensitivity was the presence of supine hypertension and residual sympathetic tone.

METHODS: In this case-control study, we screened a large global series of patients and controls, and assessed associations between p.A152T and disease risk. We included 3,229 patients with clinical Parkinson disease (PD), 442 with clinical dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 181 with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 832 with pathologically confirmed Lewy body disease (LBD), and 2,456 healthy controls.
RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies (MAF) in clinical PD cases (0.28%) and in controls (0.2%) were not found to be significantly different (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-2.98, p = 0.42).

In vivo biomarkers for disease processes in PD are important for future development of disease-modifying therapies.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of a panel of CSF biomarkers in patients with early PD and related disorders.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Regional population-based, prospective cohort study of idiopathic parkinsonism that included patients diagnosed between January 1, 2004, and April 30, 2009, by a movement disorder team at a university hospital that represented the only neurology clinic in the region. Participants were 128 nondemented patients with new-onset parkinsonism (104 with PD, 11 with multiple system atrophy, and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy) who were followed up for 5 to 9 years. At baseline, CSF from 30 healthy control participants was obtained for comparison.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of neurofilament light chain protein, Aβ1-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, and heart fatty acid-binding protein were quantified by 2 blinded measurements (at baseline and after 1 year). Follow-up included an extensive neuropsychological assessment. As PD outcome variables, mild cognitive impairment and incident PDD were diagnosed based on published criteria.
RESULTS: Among the 128 study participants, the 104 patients with early PD had a different CSF pattern compared with the 13 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (baseline area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87; P < .0001) and the 30 control participants (baseline area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.69; P = .0021). A CSF biomarker pattern associated with the development of PDD was observed. In PD, high neurofilament light chain protein, low Aβ1-42, and high heart fatty acid-binding protein at baseline were related to future PDD as analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Combined, these early biomarkers predicted PDD with high accuracy (hazard ratio, 11.8; 95% CI, 3.3-42.1; P = .0001) after adjusting for possible confounders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The analyzed CSF biomarkers have potential usefulness as a diagnostic tool in patients with parkinsonism.

This ICUAW evoked by critical illness can be due to axonal neuropathy, primary myopathy, or both. Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms comprise microvascular, electrical, metabolic, and bioenergetic alterations, interacting in a complex way and culminating in loss of muscle strength and/or muscle atrophy. ICUAW is typically symmetrical and affects predominantly proximal limb muscles and respiratory muscles, whereas facial and ocular muscles are often spared. The main risk factors for ICUAW include high severity of illness upon admission, sepsis, multiple organ failure, prolonged immobilization, and hyperglycemia, and also older patients have a higher risk. The role of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents remains unclear. ICUAW is diagnosed in awake and cooperative patients by bedside manual testing of muscle strength and the severity is scored by the Medical Research Council sum score. In cases of atypical clinical presentation or evolution, additional electrophysiological testing may be required for differential diagnosis. The cornerstones of prevention are aggressive treatment of sepsis, early mobilization, preventing hyperglycemia with insulin, and avoiding the use parenteral nutrition during the first week of critical illness. Weak patients clearly have worse acute outcomes and consume more healthcare resources. Recovery usually occurs within weeks or months, although it may be incomplete with weakness persisting up to 2 years after ICU discharge. Prognosis appears compromised when the cause of ICUAW involves critical illness polyneuropathy, whereas isolated critical illness myopathy may have a better prognosis. In addition, ICUAW has shown to contribute to the risk of 1-year mortality. Future research should focus on new preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for this detrimental complication of critical illness and on clarifying how ICUAW contributes to poor longer-term prognosis.","2015",,"Crit Care",," review","Action Potentials, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Autophagy, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Blood Glucose, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Critical Illness, TRUE, Electromyography, FALSE, Hospital Mortality, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Immobilization, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Intensive Care Units, TRUE, Length of Stay, FALSE, Muscle Strength, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Muscle Weakness, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Physical Therapy Modalities, FALSE, Respiration, Artificial, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sepsis, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

We investigated the prognostic value of imaging disease-specific metabolism patterns with 18F-FDG PET compared with that of clinical diagnosis.
METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with suspected APS at study inclusion underwent a follow-up of up to 5.9 y after prospective 18F-FDG PET imaging. Survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses according to diagnostic classifications provided by 18F-FDG PET at baseline and clinical diagnoses after a median follow-up of 1 y after PET.
RESULTS: Forty-four of 78 patients were alive 4.7±0.6 y after PET. Patients diagnosed with an APS by PET or 1-y clinical follow-up showed a significantly shorter median survival time (4.1 y, age-adjusted hazard ratios [HRs]=3.8 for both classifiers) than those diagnosed with Lewy-body diseases (LBDs; majority Parkinson disease [PD]; median survival time not reached). Subgroup classifications of progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration (PSP/CBD) or multiple-system atrophy (MSA) by PET and clinical follow-up were associated with significantly shorter survival than PD. Age-adjusted mortality was significantly increased for PSP/CBD (HR=5.2) and MSA (HR=5.6) classified by PET, but for PSP/CBD only when diagnosed by clinical follow-up (HR=4.5). Patients with a PET pattern suggestive of PD with dementia/dementia with Lewy bodies (PDD/DLB) exhibited a trend toward shorter survival than those with PD (P=0.07), whereas patients classified as PDD/DLB by clinical follow-up did not (P=0.65).
CONCLUSION: 18F-FDG PET is an early predictor of survival in patients with clinically suspected APS. Detection of cortical or subcortical hypometabolism by 18F-FDG PET is an unfavorable predictor.

The possible associations of these three polymorphisms were also investigated in PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) in a Chinese population based on the overlapping of clinical manifestations and pathological characteristics of these three neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: A total of 1276 PD, 885 sporadic ALS (SALS), 364 MSA patients, and 846 healthy controls (HCs) were included. All subjects were genotyped for the three polymorphisms using Sequenom iPLEX Assay technology.
RESULTS: Significant differences in the genotype distributions (p = 5.99E-06 and p = 4.98E-06, respectively) and the minor allele frequency (MAF) (p = 2.16E-06 and p = 2.15E-06, respectively) of SNCA rs3822086 (C) and rs11931074 (G) were observed between PD and HCs. However, no differences were found in the genotype distributions and MAF of SNCA rs3775444 (T) between PD and HCs. Haplotype that incorporated the three SNPs further strengthened the association with PD (best haplotype, p = 9.62E-005). No significant differences in the genotype distributions and MAF of the SNPs were found between SALS and HCs, MSA and HCs, and subgroups of PD and SALS. However, the MAF of SNCA rs3775444 (T) was significantly higher in MSA patients with frontal lobe dysfunction than MSA patients without dysfunction (p = 0.0002, OR 2.53, 95%CI: 1.55-4.15).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the rs3822086 (C) allele and rs11931074 (G) allele in SNCA decrease the risk for PD, and SNCA rs11931074 may affect frontal lobe dysfunction of MSA in the Chinese population.

Several α-syn-based animal models of PD have been developed to investigate the pathophysiology of PD, but none of them recapitulate the full picture of the disease. Ageing is the most compelling and major risk factor for developing PD but its impact on α-syn toxicity remains however unexplored. In this study, we developed and exploited a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector of serotype 9 overexpressing mutated α-syn to elucidate the influence of ageing on the dynamics of PD-related neurodegeneration associated with α-syn pathology in different mammalian species.
RESULTS: Identical AAV pseudotype 2/9 vectors carrying the DNA for human mutant p.A53T α-syn were injected into the substantia nigra to induce neurodegeneration and synucleinopathy in mice, rats and monkeys. Rats were used first to validate the ability of this serotype to replicate α-syn pathology and second to investigate the relationship between the kinetics of α-syn-induced nigrostriatal degeneration and the progressive onset of motor dysfunctions, strikingly reminiscent of the impairments observed in PD patients. In mice, AAV2/9-hα-syn injection into the substantia nigra was associated with accumulation of α-syn and phosphorylated hα-syn, regardless of mouse strain. However, phenotypic mutants with either accelerated senescence or resistance to senescence did not display differential susceptibility to hα-syn overexpression. Of note, p-α-syn levels correlated with nigrostriatal degeneration in mice. In monkeys, hα-syn-induced degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway was not affected by the age of the animals. Unlike mice, monkeys did not exhibit correlations between levels of phosphorylated α-syn and neurodegeneration.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, AAV2/9-mediated hα-syn induces robust nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in mice, rats and monkeys, allowing translational comparisons among species. Ageing, however, neither exacerbated nigrostriatal neurodegeneration nor α-syn pathology per se. Our unprecedented multi-species investigation thus favours the multiple-hit hypothesis for PD wherein ageing would merely be an aggravating, additive, factor superimposed upon an independent disease process.","2015",,"Acta Neuropathol Commun"," Several α-syn-based animal models of PD have been developed to investigate the pathophysiology of PD , but none of them recapitulate the full picture of the disease ","other","Aging, TRUE, Animals, FALSE, Biomechanical Phenomena, FALSE, Callithrix, FALSE, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Green Fluorescent Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, MPTP Poisoning, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Mice, FALSE, Motor Activity, FALSE, Principal Component Analysis, FALSE, Psychomotor Performance, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Rats, FALSE, Striatonigral Degeneration, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Time Factors, FALSE, Transduction, Genetic, FALSE, Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Limiting levels of SMN result in the neuromuscular disorder, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is presently untreatable. The most-documented function of the SMN-Gemins complex concerns the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Despite multiple genetic studies, the Gemin proteins have not been identified as prominent modifiers of SMN-associated mutant phenotypes. In the present report, we make use of the Drosophila model organism to investigate whether viability and motor phenotypes associated with a hypomorphic Gemin3 mutant are enhanced by changes in the levels of SMN, Gemin2 and Gemin5 brought about by various genetic manipulations. We show a modifier effect by all three members of the minimalistic fly SMN-Gemins complex within the muscle compartment of the motor unit. Interestingly, muscle-specific overexpression of Gemin2 was by itself sufficient to depress normal motor function and its enhanced upregulation in all tissues leads to a decline in fly viability. The toxicity associated with increased Gemin2 levels is conserved in the yeast S. pombe in which we find that the cytoplasmic retention of Sm proteins, likely reflecting a block in the snRNP assembly pathway, is a contributing factor. We propose that a disruption in the normal stoichiometry of the SMN-Gemins complex depresses its function with consequences that are detrimental to the motor system.","2015",,"PLoS One"," In the present report , we make use of the Drosophila model organism to investigate whether viability and motor phenotypes associated with a hypomorphic Gemin3 mutant are enhanced by changes in the levels of SMN , Gemin2 and Gemin5 brought about by various genetic manipulations ","other","Animals, FALSE, Cytoplasm, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Drosophila, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Drosophila Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Motor Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Muscles, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Muscular Atrophy, Spinal, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Mutation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, RNA-Binding Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, SMN Complex Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Schizosaccharomyces, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Spliceosomes, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Up-Regulation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The fact that the gene encoding α-synuclein is associated with both diseases also suggests that they share some genetic determinants. Recent studies in Japan associating MSA with a variant in the COQ2 gene led us to question whether variants in the COQ2 gene are associated with PD in Han Chinese in a case-control study. A total of 564 patients with PD were genotyped using the ligase detection rection, together with 484 gender- and age-matched healthy subjects. The M128V and R387X variants of COQ2 were not detected in patients or controls; instead, we detected only the heterozygous V393A variant (CT genotype). The frequency of the CT genotype encoding the V393A mutation was significantly higher in patients PD (4.08%) than in controls (1.86%), corresponding to an odds ratio of 2.24 (95%CI 1.03 to 4.90, p = 0.037). The frequency of the C allele of the V393A variant was significantly higher in patients with PD than in controls (OR 2.22, 95%CI 1.02 to 4.82, p = 0.039), and this was also observed in a meta-analysis of studies from mainland China, Taiwan and Japan. Subgroup analysis of our data showed that the V393A variant was significantly associated with early-onset PD (OR 3.71, 95%CI 1.51 to 9.15, p = 0.002) but not with late-onset disease (OR 1.65, 95%CI 0.69 to 3.95, p = 0.260). Gender was not significantly associated with either genotype or minor allele frequencies. In conclusion, our findings show for the first time that the V393A variant in the COQ2 gene increases risk of PD among the population of east Asia.

Failure of the vasoconstrictor response is thought to be responsible for orthostatic hypotension, but the degree of impairment of this response in patients with MSA is unclear. We assessed autonomic function in patients with MSA by evaluating the vasoconstrictive response during a head-up tilt test and determining its relationship to orthostatic hypotension. As an additional examination, the efficacy of norepinephrine in treating orthostatic hypotension was also assessed.
METHODS: The study included 82 patients with MSA and 28 controls. Measures of total peripheral resistance were obtained during a head-up tilt test. Norepinephrine was administered to the patients lacking a vasoconstrictive response to evaluate its ability to treat orthostatic hypotension.
RESULTS: At a 60° tilt, orthostatic hypotension occurred in 47.6% of the patients and 0% of controls. Reduction in total peripheral resistance from baseline at a 60° tilt was observed in 69.5% of the patients and 0% of controls. In patients with MSA, changes in systolic blood pressure from the baseline at a 60° tilt correlated positively with changes in the total peripheral resistance (r = 0.69, p < 0.0001). Norepinephrine prevented the reduction of total peripheral resistance and development of orthostatic hypotension.

METHODS: We recruited participants with probable multiple system atrophy-of either the parkinsonism subtype (MSA-P) or the cerebellar ataxia subtype (MSA-C)-at 12 neurology centres in the USA specialising in movement or autonomic disorders. We followed up patients every 6 months for 5 years and assessed them with the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale part I (UMSARS I; a functional score of symptoms and ability to undertake activities of daily living), UMSARS II (neurological motor evaluation), and the Composite Autonomic Symptoms Scale (COMPASS)-select (a measure of autonomic symptoms and autonomic functional status). We assessed potential predictors of outcome. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate univariate hazard ratios for shorter survival using age at disease onset as a continuous variable and sex, clinical phenotype, and early development of neurological and autonomic manifestations as categorical variables.
FINDINGS: We recruited 175 participants. Mean age at study entry was 63·4 years (SD 8·6). Median survival from symptom onset was 9·8 years (95% CI 8·8-10·7) and median survival from enrolment was 1·8 years (0·9-2·7). Participants with severe symptomatic autonomic failure (symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, or both) at diagnosis (n=62) had a worse prognosis than those without severe disease (n=113; median survival 8·0 years, 95% CI 6·5-9·5 vs 10·3 years, 9·3-11·4; p=0·021). At baseline, patients with MSA-P (n=126) and MSA-C (n=49) had much the same symptoms and functional status: mean UMSARS I 25·2 (SD 8·08) versus 24·6 (8·34; p=0·835); mean UMSARS II 26·4 (8·8) versus 25·4 (10·5; p=0·764); COMPASS-select 43·5 (18·7) versus 42·8 (19·6; p=0·835). Progression over 5 years, assessed by change in UMSARS I, UMSARS II, and COMPASS-select, was modest.

In neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH), inadequate vasoconstriction and cardiac output cause BP to drop excessively, resulting in inadequate perfusion, with predictable symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness and falls. The condition may represent a central failure of baroreceptor signals to modulate cardiovascular function, a peripheral failure of norepinephrine release from cardiovascular sympathetic nerve endings, or both. Symptomatic patients may benefit from both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions. Among the latter, two pressor agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: the sympathomimetic prodrug midodrine, approved in 1996 for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, and the norepinephrine prodrug droxidopa, approved in 2014, which is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension caused by primary autonomic failure (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure). A wide variety of off-label options also have been described (e.g. the synthetic mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone). Because pressor agents may promote supine hypertension, NOH management requires monitoring of supine BP and also lifestyle measures to minimize supine BP increases (e.g. head-of-bed elevation). However, NOH has been associated with cognitive impairment and increases a patient's risk of syncope and falls, with the potential for serious consequences. Hence, concerns about supine hypertension - for which the long-term prognosis in patients with NOH is yet to be established - must sometimes be balanced by the need to address a patient's immediate risks.","2015",,"Postgrad Med",," review","Accidental Falls, FALSE, prevention & control, Q000517, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, TRUE, drug therapy, Q000188, Disease Management, FALSE, Droxidopa, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hypotension, Orthostatic, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Male, FALSE, Midodrine, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Vasoconstrictor Agents, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Regression analyses adjusting for medical variables, demographic characteristics, and CBF-V of the MCA, showed increased BMI was associated with reduced white matter volume (
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest increased BMI negatively affects brain volume in HF, and higher BMI interacts with cerebral perfusion to impact gray matter volume. The mechanisms for these findings remain unclear and likely involve multiple physiological processes. Prospective studies are needed to elucidate the exact pattern and rates of brain changes in obese HF persons.","2014",,"BMC Obes",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: We sequenced coding regions and flanking splice sites of GBA in 969 MSA patients (574 Japanese, 223 European, and 172 North American) and 1509 control subjects (900 Japanese, 315 European, and 294 North American). We focused solely on Gaucher-disease-causing GBA variants.
RESULTS: In the Japanese series, we found nine carriers among the MSA patients (1.65%) and eight carriers among the control subjects (0.89%). In the European series, we found three carriers among the MSA patients (1.35%) and two carriers among the control subjects (0.63%). In the North American series, we found five carriers among the MSA patients (2.91%) and one carrier among the control subjects (0.34%).

This syndrome is caused by mutations in the RAB3GAP1/2 and RAB18 genes, part of the Rab family, and in the TBC1D20 gene, which contributes to lipid droplet formation/metabolism. Here we present a patient with clinical diagnosis of WARBM syndrome, who did not have mutations in either the RAB3GAP1/2 genes, in the main exons of RAB18, nor in the TBC1D20 gene. However, the analysis with CGH-array detected a 9.6 Mb deletion at 1q43-qter. We performed a genotype-phenotype correlation using 20 previously published patients in whom the coordinates of the deleted regions were defined. The comparative analysis revealed that the current patient and three of the other 20 patients share the loss of six genes, four of which are related with the family of G proteins, and are strongly expressed in the brain, retina, heart and kidney. Consequently, their haploinsufficiency may result in different combinations of clinical alterations, including some of those of WARBM syndrome. In addition, the haploinsufficiency of other genes may contribute to other defects and clinical variability. Additionally, for the genotype-phenotype correlation, one must also consider molecular pathways that can result in the observed alterations.

Thus, the possible role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of MSA has emerged. Here, we studied brain energy metabolism in vivo in early MSA-parkinsonism (MSA-P) patients and compared to healthy controls.
METHODS: We have used combined phosphorus and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure high- and low-energy phosphates in the basal ganglia of early (Hoehn and Yahr stage I-III), probable MSA-P patients (N = 9) compared to healthy controls (N = 9).
RESULTS: No significant changes in the high energy phosphates and other parameters reflecting the energy status of the cells were found in the basal ganglia of MSA-P patients compared to healthy controls. N-acetylaspartate was significantly reduced in MSA-P compared to healthy controls and correlated with the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale.

We examine four issues that may be important in planning for therapeutic success. First, neuromuscular phenotypes in the SMNΔ7 mouse model closely match those in human patients but peripheral disease manifestations differ, suggesting that endpoints other than mouse lifespan may be more useful in predicting clinical outcome. Second, SMN plays important roles in multiple central and peripheral cell types, not just motor neurons, and it remains unclear which of these cell types need to be targeted therapeutically. Third, should SMN-restoration therapy not be effective in all patients, blocking molecular changes downstream of SMN reduction may confer significant benefit, making it important to evaluate therapeutic targets other than SMN.

Although mild traumatic brain injury, including concussion and subconcussion, is by far the most common, it is also the most difficult to diagnose and the least well understood. Proper recognition, management, and treatment of acute concussion and mild traumatic brain injury are the fundamentals of an emerging clinical discipline. It is also becoming increasingly clear that some mild traumatic brain injuries have persistent, and sometimes progressive, long-term debilitating effects. Evidence indicates that a single traumatic brain injury can precipitate or accelerate multiple age-related neurodegenerations, increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron disease, and that repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries can provoke the development of a tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Clinically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory loss, and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and progress slowly over decades. Pathologically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy produces atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, thalamus, and hypothalamus, septal abnormalities, and abnormal deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau (τ) as neurofibrillary tangles and disordered neurites throughout the brain. The incidence and prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the genetic risk factors critical to its development are currently unknown. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy frequently occurs as a sole diagnosis, but may be associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, and motor neuron disease. Currently, chronic traumatic encephalopathy can be diagnosed only at autopsy; however, promising efforts to develop imaging, spinal fluid, and peripheral blood biomarkers are underway to diagnose and monitor the course of disease in living subjects.","2015",,"Handb Clin Neurol",," review","Animals, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Brain Injuries, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Encephalitis, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Glasgow Coma Scale, FALSE, Humans, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Thus, the basal forebrain cholinergic system is known to undergo moderate neurodegenerative changes during normal aging as well as severe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Parkinson's disease (PD), a degeneration of nigro-striatal DA neurons is the most conspicuous reflection of the vulnerability of DA neurons to age. In this context, cell reprogramming offers novel therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of these devastating diseases. In effect, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells demonstrated that adult mammalian cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state by the overexpression of a few embryonic transcription factors (TF). This discovery fundamentally widened the research horizon in the fields of disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Although it is possible to re-differentiate iPSCs to specific somatic cell types, the tumorigenic potential of contaminating iPSCs that failed to differentiate, increases the risk for clinical application of somatic cells generated by this procedure. Therefore, reprogramming approaches that bypass the pluripotent stem cell state are being explored. A method called lineage reprogramming has been recently documented. It consists of the direct conversion of one adult cell type into another by transgenic expression of multiple lineage-specific TF or microRNAs. Another approach, termed direct reprogramming, features several advantages such as the use of universal TF system and the ability to generate a rejuvenated multipotent progenitor cell population, able to differentiate into specific cell types in response to a specific differentiation factors. These novel approaches offer a new promise for the treatment of pathologies associated with the loss of specific cell types as for instance, nigral DA neurons (in PD) or basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the early stages of AD.

With a pathological hallmark of alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs; Papp-Lantos inclusions), MSA patients exhibit marked neurodegenerative changes in the striatonigral and/or olivopontocerebellar structures of the brain. As a member of the alpha-synucleinopathy family, which is defined by its well-demarcated alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions and aggregation, MSA's clinical presentation exhibits several overlapping features with other members including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Given the extensive fund of knowledge regarding the genetic etiology of PD revealed within the past several years, a genetic investigation of MSA is warranted. While a current genome-wide association study is underway for MSA to further clarify the role of associated genetic loci and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, several cases have presented solid preliminary evidence of a genetic etiology. Naturally, genes and variants manifesting known associations with PD (and other phenotypically similar neurodegenerative disorders), including SNCA and MAPT, have been comprehensively investigated in MSA patient cohorts. More recently variants in COQ2 have been linked to MSA in the Japanese population although this finding awaits replication. Nonetheless, significant positive associations with subsequent independent replication studies have been scarce. With very limited information regarding genetic mutations or alterations in gene dosage as a cause of MSA, the search for novel risk genes, which may be in the form of common variants or rare variants, is the logical nexus for MSA research.

The term activation comprises any deviation from what otherwise is considered normal microglia status, including cellular abundance, morphology or protein expression. The microglial response during disease will sustain survival or otherwise promote cell degeneration. The novel concepts of alpha-synuclein being released and uptaken by neighboring cells, and their importance in disease progression, positions microglia as the main cell that can clear and handle alpha-synuclein efficiently. Microglia's behavior will therefore be a determinant on the disease's progression.

METHODS: In a 10-year prospective cohort, we tested prodromal Parkinson disease markers in 89 patients with idiopathic RBD. With Kaplan-Meier analysis, we calculated risk of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, and using Cox proportional hazards, tested the ability of prodromal markers to identify patients at higher disease risk. By combining predictive markers, we then designed stratification strategies to optimally select patients for definitive neuroprotective trials.
RESULTS: The risk of defined neurodegenerative synucleinopathy was high: 30% developed disease at 3 years, rising to 66% at 7.5 years. Advanced age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07), olfactory loss (HR = 2.8), abnormal color vision (HR = 3.1), subtle motor dysfunction (HR = 3.9), and nonuse of antidepressants (HR = 3.5) identified higher risk of disease conversion. However, mild cognitive impairment (HR = 1.8), depression (HR = 0.63), Parkinson personality, treatment with clonazepam (HR = 1.3) or melatonin (HR = 0.55), autonomic markers, and sex (HR = 1.37) did not clearly predict clinical neurodegeneration. Stratification with prodromal markers increased risk of neurodegenerative disease conversion by 200%, and combining markers allowed sample size reduction in neuroprotective trials by >40%. With a moderately effective agent (HR = 0.5), trials with fewer than 80 subjects per group can demonstrate definitive reductions in neurodegenerative disease.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the offer of targeted genetic carrier screening as a method to identify high-risk couples for having affected offspring in this high-risk subpopulation. In one year, 203 individuals (92 couples and 19 individuals) were counseled.

METHODS: A total of 27,777 patients (272 with early gastric cancer and 135 with advanced gastric cancer) were included in this study. Endoscopically evaluated atrophy of the gastric mucosa was classified as C-0 to O-3 according to the Kimura and Takemoto classification system.
RESULTS: The cancer detection rate in relation to the degree of gastric mucosal atrophy was 0.04% (2/4,183 patients) for C-0, 0% (0/4,506) for C-1, 0.25% (9/3,660) for C-2, 0.71% (21/2,960) for C-3, 1.32% (75/5,684) for O-1, 3.70% (140/3,780) for O-2 and 5.33% (160/3,004) for O-3. As to the proportions of differentiated and undifferentiated cancers, the latter were relatively frequent in the C-0 to C-2 groups, but differentiated cancers became predominant as atrophy progressed. On the other hand, the number of both differentiated and undifferentiated cancers detected increased as gastric mucosal atrophy progressed. In addition, open-type atrophy was found in 29 (96.7%) of 30 patients with synchronous multiple gastric cancers and in all 20 patients with metachronous multiple gastric cancers.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic evaluation of gastric mucosal atrophy can provide a simple and reliable predictive index for both current and future carcinogenic risk.","2015",,"Digestion"," This study aimed to clarify the carcinogenic risk in relation to the degree of atrophy ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Carcinogenesis, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Early Detection of Cancer, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gastric Mucosa, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Gastritis, Atrophic, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Helicobacter Infections, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Helicobacter pylori, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Stomach Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The ligase detection reaction was used to measure the frequency of the V393A variant of COQ2 in 282 patients with ALS and 491 healthy controls.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical signs of horses intoxicated with Lathyrus hirsutus and speculate on the neuroanatomical lesion localization and pathogenesis based upon the observed clinical signs.
ANIMALS: Twenty-two of 25 horses ranging in age from 6 to 34 months were affected. Five affected horses were presented to the OSUCHVS for evaluation and treatment after having been attended at the ranch by a local veterinarian (ALA). An additional horse that had been euthanized was also presented for necropsy.
METHODS: A case series is presented. Diagnostic evaluation included: physical examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, CSF analysis, EMG, ERG, upper airway endoscopy, muscle biopsy, and serum vitamin E analysis. The grain ration consumed by the affected horses was analyzed for ionophores and cultured for fungi: the hay was examined for toxic plants.
RESULTS: Bermuda grass hay consumed by the horses contained large quantities of mature Lathyrus hirsutus. Acute clinical signs conform to earlier descriptions of Lathyrus hirsutus intoxication in cattle. Residual neurologic signs were characterized by incoordination in the rhythmicity of multiple gaits. Evidence of mild neurogenic muscle atrophy was recognized in 1 of 5 horses biopsied.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Caley Pea intoxication may occur within days of seed pod consumption. The neurologic signs are unique and suggest involvement of the upper motor neuron system and regions of the spinal cord influencing voluntary motor movement.

Genome-wide Association Studies has demonstrated a wide array of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the increasing risk of developing the more common type, sporadic PD, further corroborating the genetic etiology of PD. Among them, SNCA is a gene responsible for encoding α-synuclein, a protein found to be the major component of Lewy body and Lewy neurite, both of these components are the pathognomonic hallmarks of PD. Thus, it has been postulated that this gene plays specific roles in pathogenesis of PD. Here, we summarize the basic biological characteristics of the wild type of the protein (wt-α-synuclein) as well as genetic and epigenetic features of its encoding gene (SNCA) in PD. Based on these characteristics, SNCA may be involved in PD pathogenesis in at least 2 ways: wt-α-synuclein overexpression and its mutation types via different mechanisms. Associations between SNCA mutations and other Lewy body disorders, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy, are also mentioned. Finally, it is necessary to explore the influences which SNCA exerts on clinical and neuropathological phenotypes by promoting the transfer of scientific research into practice, such as clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease.

MSA impacts on the autonomic nervous system affecting blood pressure, heart rate and bladder function, and the motor system affecting balance and muscle movement. The cause of MSA is unknown, no definitive risk factors have been identified, and there is no cure or effective treatment. The definitive pathology of MSA is the presence of α-synuclein aggregates in the brain and therefore MSA is classified as an α-synucleinopathy, together with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Although the molecular mechanisms of misfolding, fibrillation and aggregation of α-synuclein partly overlap with other α-synucleinopathies, the pathological pathway of MSA is unique in that the principal site for α-synuclein deposition is in the oligodendrocytes rather than the neurons. The sequence of pathological events of MSA is now recognized as abnormal protein redistributions in oligodendrocytes first, followed by myelin dysfunction and then neurodegeneration. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the production and maintenance of myelin, the specialized lipid membrane that encases the axons of all neurons in the brain. Myelin is composed of lipids and two prominent proteins, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein. In vitro studies suggest that aberration in protein distribution and lipid transport may lead to myelin dysfunction in MSA. The purpose of this perspective is to bring together available evidence to explore the potential role of α-synuclein, myelin protein dysfunction, lipid dyshomeostasis and ABCA8 in MSA pathogenesis.","2014",,"Exp Neurobiol"," The cause of MSA is unknown , no definitive risk factors have been identified , and there is no cure or effective treatment "," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in patients with PD and MSA who presented to three referral centers between 2005 and 2012. Patients referred to the urology department for lower urinary tract symptoms underwent urodynamic studies. Patients with other rare or ambiguous subtypes of PPS, urinary tract infection, urinary stones, or other neurogenic conditions were excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 581 consecutive patients (359 men and 222 women) were analyzed. The mean patient age was 69.2 (SD, 9.3) years. Among these patients, 390 (64.3%) had PD, and 191 (31.5%) had MSA. Patients with MSA showed a statistically significantly decreased maximal flow rate and increased post-void residual urine volume compared with patients with PD (P range, <0.001-0.005). In addition, voiding failure occurred more frequently in patients with MSA than in those with PD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.73). Patients with MSA showed a higher prevalence of low-compliance (P = 0.001), decreased bladder contractility (P < 0.001), and an increased rate of voiding failure (P = 0.001). In patients with MSA, decreased detrusor contractility was more prominent in the cerebellar ataxia predominant subtype (MSA-C; P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that the MSA subtype was the only independent risk factor for impaired detrusor contractility (men, OR = 2.692; P = 0.006; women, OR = 2.965; P = 0.007).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinally and clinically a GBA mutation-positive cohort and the evolution of the prodromal features of PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants in a study of the etiology and prodrome of PD were reevaluated in this clinic-based 2-year follow-up report. Patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) and heterozygous GBA mutation carriers were recruited in 2010 from the Lysosomal Storage Disorder Unit at the Royal Free Hospital, London, England. Thirty patients who previously received a diagnosis of type 1 GD, 28 heterozygous GBA mutation carriers, and 26 genetically unrelated controls were included. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of PD or dementia for both the patients with GD and the GBA mutation carriers and any existing neurological disease for the controls.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Assessment was performed for clinical markers using standardized scales for hyposmia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive function, and parkinsonian motor signs (using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscale [UPDRS part III]).
RESULTS: Over 2 years, depression scores were significantly worse for heterozygous carriers (mean baseline, 0.65; mean follow-up, 2.88; P = .01), rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder scores were significantly worse for patients with GD (mean baseline, 0.93; mean follow-up, 2.93; P < .001) and heterozygotes (mean baseline, 0.10; mean follow-up, 2.30; P < .001), and UPDRS part III scores were significantly worse for patients with GD (mean baseline, 4.29; mean follow-up, 7.82; P < .001) and heterozygotes (mean baseline, 1.97; mean follow-up, 4.50; P < .001). For controls, there was a small but significant deterioration in the UPDRS part II (activities of daily living) score (mean baseline, 0.00; mean follow-up, 0.58; P = .006). At 2 years, olfactory and cognitive assessment scores were lower in patients with GD and heterozygotes compared with controls, but they did not differ significantly from baseline. When the results from the patients with GD and the heterozygotes were combined, a significant deterioration from baseline was observed, as reflected in the Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire (mean baseline, 0.51; mean follow-up, 2.63; P < .001), Beck Depression Inventory (mean baseline, 1.72; mean follow-up, 4.44; P = .002), and UPDRS part II (mean baseline, 0.88; mean follow-up, 2.01; P < .001) and part III scores (mean baseline, 3.09; mean follow-up, 6.10; P < .001) (all P < .01), and at 2 years, significant differences in University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and UPDRS part II and part III scores were observed between patients with GD/heterozygotes and controls (all P < .05).

METHODS: By quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR), western blot, immunohistochemistry, and bioinformatics analysis, we studied PLD3 expression patterns and levels in a series of AD and control brains, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and non-neurological cases.
RESULTS: The levels of PLD3 mRNA and protein expression were reduced modestly in AD brains, compared with those in non-AD brains. In all brains, PLD3 was expressed constitutively in cortical neurons, hippocampal pyramidal and granular neurons but not in glial cells. Notably, PLD3 immunoreactivity was accumulated on neuritic plaques in AD brains.

METHODS: One series from the United States (92 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA, 416 controls) and a second series from the United Kingdom (85 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA, 352 controls) were included in this case-control study. We supplemented these data with those of 53 patients from the United States with clinically probable or possible MSA. Seventeen common LRRK2 exonic variants were genotyped and assessed for association with MSA.
RESULTS: In the combined series of 177 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA and 768 controls, there was a significant association between LRRK2 p.M2397T and MSA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.60, p = 0.002). This protective effect was observed more strongly in the US series (OR = 0.46, p = 0.0008) than the UK series (OR = 0.82, p = 0.41). We observed other noteworthy associations with MSA for p.G1624G (OR = 0.63, p = 0.006) and p.N2081D (OR = 0.15, p = 0.010). The p.G1624G-M2397T haplotype was significantly associated with MSA in the US series (p < 0.0001) and combined series (p = 0.003) but not the UK series (p = 0.67). Results were consistent when additionally including the US patients with clinical MSA, where the strongest single-variant association was again observed for p.M2397T (OR = 0.59, p = 0.0005).

Orthostatic hypotension is commonly associated with hypertension, and its prevalence is highest in those with uncontrolled hypertension compared to those with controlled hypertension or normotensive community elderly subjects. Orthostatic hypotension can cause significant disability, with patients experiencing dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope, and other problems that potentially have a profound negative impact on activities of daily living that require standing or walking. Furthermore, OH increases the risk of falls and, importantly, is an independent risk factor of mortality. Despite its importance, there is a paucity of treatment options for this condition. Most of the advances in treatment options have relied on small studies of repurposed drugs done in patients with severe OH due to rare neurodegenerative conditions. Midodrine, an oral prodrug converted to the selective α1-adrenoceptor agonist desglymidodrine, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of OH in 1996. For almost two decades, no other pharmacotherapy was developed specifically for the treatment of OH until 2014, when droxidopa was approved by the FDA for the treatment of neurogenic OH associated with primary autonomic neuropathies including Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. These are neurodegenerative diseases ultimately characterized by failure of the autonomic nervous system to generate norepinephrine responses appropriate to postural challenge. Droxidopa is a synthetic amino acid that is converted to norepinephrine by dopa-decarboxylase, the same enzyme that converts levodopa into dopamine in the treatment of Parkinson disease.

These deficits include problems with attention, information processing speed, and working memory. This constellation of deficits can occur with any disease course, and a minimal correlation has been found between physical disability assessed by EDSS and cognitive impairment. Many studies have shown that cognitive impairment is correlated with brain lesion volume, as well as brain atrophy. There are promising neuroimaging indicators that may be useful for identifying patients at risk for cognitive impairment, such as diffusion tensor imaging, the magnetization transfer ratio, and N-acetyl aspartate levels. Cognitive dysfunction is associated with adverse effects on quality of life, employment status, and social activities. Today, there are three avenues for treatment: disease modifying therapies, symptomatic treatments, and cognitive rehabilitation. Unfortunately, data linking therapeutic interventions are limited.

,"25221469","ROCK inhibition as a therapy for spinal muscular atrophy: understanding the repercussions on multiple cellular targets.","Coque E","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic disease causing infant death, due to an extended loss of motoneurons. This neuromuscular disorder results from deletions and/or mutations within the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, leading to a pathological decreased expression of functional full-length SMN protein. Emerging studies suggest that the small GTPase RhoA and its major downstream effector Rho kinase (ROCK), which both play an instrumental role in cytoskeleton organization, contribute to the pathology of motoneuron diseases. Indeed, an enhanced activation of RhoA and ROCK has been reported in the spinal cord of an SMA mouse model. Moreover, the treatment of SMA mice with ROCK inhibitors leads to an increased lifespan as well as improved skeletal muscle and neuromuscular junction pathology, without preventing motoneuron degeneration. Although motoneurons are the primary target in SMA, an increasing number of reports show that other cell types inside and outside the central nervous system contribute to SMA pathogenesis. As administration of ROCK inhibitors to SMA mice was systemic, the improvement in survival and phenotype could therefore be attributed to specific effects on motoneurons and/or on other non-neuronal cell types. In the present review, we will present the various roles of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in several SMA cellular targets including neurons, myoblasts, glial cells, cardiomyocytes and pancreatic cells as well as discuss how ROCK inhibition may ameliorate their health and function. It is most likely a concerted influence of ROCK modulation on all these cell types that ultimately lead to the observed benefits of pharmacological ROCK inhibition in SMA mice.","2014",,"Front Neurosci",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of a fractional radiofrequency microneedle system (FRMS) on acne scars in Asians at 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up visits after treatment.
METHODS: Thirty subjects with atrophic acne scars for more than 6 months were enrolled in the study. All volunteers were treated with a FRMS on affected areas. The subjects were treated for a total number of three treatment sessions at 1-month intervals. Subjective assessments were obtained at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months after the last treatment session by self-evaluation and two blinded dermatologists. Objective evaluation using an ultraviolet A-light video camera was also performed. In addition, pain scores, immediate reactions, healing times and other adverse effects were evaluated.
RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects with skin phototypes III-V completed treatment protocol. The average mean scar age was 7 years (range: 0.5-15 years). At 6-month follow-up visit, the majority of the subjects (42.3%) reported a 26-50% improvement on their acne scars. Percent reduction in scar volume corresponded to clinical evaluation.

Patients with acute neurological diseases have in common the presence of hyper metabolism and hyper catabolism both associated to a period of prolonged fasting mainly for the frequent gastrointestinal complications, many times as a side effect of drugs administered. During the acute phase, spinal cord injuries presented a reduction in the energy expenditure but an increase in the nitrogen elimination. In order to correct the negative nitrogen balance increase intakes is performed with the result of a hyper alimentation that should be avoided due to the complications resulting. In patients with chronic neurological diseases and in the acute phase of cerebrovascular accident, dysphagia could be present which also affects intakes. Several chronic neurological diseases have also dementia, which lead to alterations in the eating behavior. The presence of malnutrition complicates the clinical evolution, increases muscular atrophy with higher incidence of respiratory failure and less capacity to disphagia recuperation, alters the immune response with higher rate of infections, increases the likelihood of fractures and of pressure ulcers, increases the incapacity degree and is an independent factor to increase mortality.

Our aim was to describe the natural course including neurological and developmental features and other aspects of care in a homogeneous group of PCH2 patients all carrying the p.A307S mutation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited via the German patients' organizations. Inclusion criteria were imaging findings of PCH2 and a p.A307S mutation. Data were collected using medical reports and patient questionnaires discussed in a standardized telephone interview.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included. When considering survival until age 11 years, 53% of children had died Weight, length and head circumference, mostly in the normal range at birth, became abnormal, especially head circumference (-5.58 SD at age 5 yrs). Neurologic symptoms: Choreathetosis was present in 88% (62% with pyramidal signs), 12% had pure spasticity. Epileptic seizures were manifest in 82%, status epilepticus in 39%. Non-epileptic dystonic attacks occurred in 33%. General symptoms: feeding difficulties were recorded in 100%, sleep disorder in 96%, apneas in 67% and recurrent infections in 52%; gastroesophageal reflux disease was diagnosed in 73%, 67% got percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and 36% a Nissen-fundoplication. Neurodevelopmental data: All children made progress, but on a low level: such as fixing and following with the eyes was seen in 76%, attempting to grasp objects (76%), moderate head control (73%), social smile (70%), rolling from prone to supine (58%), and sitting without support (9%). Ten percent lost achieved abilities on follow-up. The presence of prenatal symptoms did not correlate with outcome.

A number of studies have reported the abnormalities in TMS assays of cortical function in dementias. A PubMed-based literature review on TMS studies targeting primary and secondary dementia has been conducted using the key words ""transcranial magnetic stimulation"" or ""motor cortex excitability"" and ""dementia"" or ""cognitive impairment"" or ""memory impairment"" or ""memory decline"". Cortical excitability is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in vascular dementia (VaD), generally reduced in secondary dementias. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a measure of central cholinergic circuitry, is normal in VaD and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but suppressed in AD. In mild cognitive impairment, abnormal SAI may predict the progression to AD. No change in cortical excitability has been observed in FTD, in Parkinson's dementia and in dementia with Lewy bodies. Short-interval intracortical inhibition and controlateral silent period (cSP), two measures of gabaergic cortical inhibition, are abnormal in most dementias associated with parkinsonian symptoms. Ipsilateral silent period (iSP), which is dependent on integrity of the corpus callosum is abnormal in AD. While single TMS measure owns low specificity, a panel of measures can support the clinical diagnosis, predict progression and possibly identify earlier the ""brain at risk"".

Multiple sclerosis pathologic damage typically includes demyelination, neuro-axonal loss, and astrogliosis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of magnetic resonance markers of central nervous system injury to predict brain-volume loss and clinical disability in multiple sclerosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were selected from the Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of California-San Francisco. The preliminary data set included 59 patients with MS and 43 healthy control individuals. The confirmatory data set included 220 patients from an independent, large genotype-phenotype research project.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline N-acetylaspartate (NAA) level, myo-inositol (mI) in normal-appearing white and gray matter, myelin water fraction in normal-appearing white matter, markers of axonal damage, astrogliosis, and demyelination were evaluated as predictors in a preliminary data set. Potential predictors were subsequently tested for replication in a confirmatory data set. Clinical scores and percentage of brain-volume change were obtained annually over 4 years as outcomes. Predictors of outcomes were assessed using linear models, linear mixed-effects models, and logistic regression.
RESULTS: N-acetylaspartate and mI both had statistically significant effects on brain volume, prompting the use of the mI:NAA ratio in normal-appearing white matter as a predictor. The ratio was a predictor of brain-volume change in both cohorts (annual slope in the percentage of brain-volume change/unit of increase in the ratio: -1.68; 95% CI, -3.05 to -0.30; P = .02 in the preliminary study cohort and -1.08; 95% CI, -1.95 to -0.20; P = .02 in the confirmatory study cohort). Furthermore, the mI:NAA ratio predicted clinical disability (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite evolution: -0.52 points annually, P < .001; Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite sustained progression: odds ratio, 2.76/SD increase in the ratio; 95% CI, 1.32 to 6.47; P = .01) in the preliminary data set and predicted Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite evolution (-0.23 points annually; P = .01), Expanded Disability Status Scale evolution (0.57 points annually; P = .04), and Expanded Disability Status Scale sustained progression (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.94; P = .009) in the confirmatory data set.

Here we summarize some of the latest literature on autonomic dysfunction, focusing primarily on the perioperative implications.
RECENT FINDINGS: The variety of autonomic dysfunction now extends to a large number of clinical conditions in which the cause or effect of the autonomic component is blurred. Methods for detecting dysautonomia can be as simple as performing a history and physical examination that includes orthostatic vital signs measured in both recumbent and vertical positions; however, specialized laboratories are required for definitive diagnosis. Heart rate variability monitoring is becoming more commonplace in the assessment and understanding of autonomic instability. Degenerative diseases of the autonomic nervous system include Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, with the most serious manifestations being postural hypotension and paradoxical supine hypertension. Other conditions occur in which the autonomic dysfunction is only part of a larger disease process, such as diabetic autonomic neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury.
SUMMARY: Patients with dysautonomia often have unpredictable and paradoxical physiological responses to various perioperative stimuli. Knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of their condition is required in order to reduce symptom exacerbation and limit morbidity and mortality during the perioperative period.","2014",,"Curr Opin Anaesthesiol"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The autonomic nervous system functions to control heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate , gastrointestinal motility , hormone release , and body temperature on a second-to-second basis "," review","Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Humans, FALSE, Perioperative Care, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Primary Dysautonomias, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Recent studies indicate that TMEM106B plays a pathological role in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, at present, the precise levels of TMEM106B expression in AD brains remain unknown.
METHODS: By quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (qPCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry, we studied TMEM106B and PGRN expression levels in a series of AD and control brains, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and non-neurological cases.
RESULTS: In AD brains, TMEM106B mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced, whereas PGRN mRNA levels were elevated, compared with the levels in non-AD brains. In all brains, TMEM106B was expressed in the majority of cortical neurons, hippocampal neurons, and some populations of oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes and microglia with the location in the cytoplasm. In AD brains, surviving neurons expressed intense TMEM106B immunoreactivity, while senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and the perivascular neuropil, almost devoid of TMEM106B, intensely expressed PGRN.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze drug use from the database of the French MSA Reference Center, and to compare it with data from patients with Parkinson disease (PD).
METHODS: Medication of 147 MSA and 180 age- and sex-matched PD patients was analyzed. Motor and autonomic symptoms were explored in MSA patients by the SCOPA-Autonomic and Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS).
RESULTS: MSA and PD patients received a mean of five different drugs. MSA patients were more frequently exposed to laxatives, antidiabetic medications, antihypotensives, muscarinic antagonists, alpha-adrenergic blockers, and antidepressants. Levodopa consumption was less in MSA-C (cerebellar) patients compared with MSA-P (parkinsonian) and PD patients. Dopamine agonists were more consumed by PD than MSA patients. MSA patients with more severe disability received more laxatives, anticoagulants, and antidepressants. MSA-P patients received more analgesics. ""Probable"" MSA patients received more antihypotensives and less alpha-adrenergic blockers. Patients with higher SCOPA-Autonomic scores were more frequently on antihypotensives or antidepressants. Drug associations leading to potential adverse interactions were uncommon (usually <5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Some differences in drug use between MSA and PD patients were observed and expected, including those used for the relief of parkinsonian motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and depression. Many of these drugs are frequently used in MSA in the absence of well-established, positive, benefit-risk evaluations, thus calling for better assessments.

Surprisingly, the nature of their relationship has not been carefully characterized across a range of normal and disease states. Are brains with more torpedoes expected to have fewer PCs? We quantified torpedoes and PCs in four groups: essential tremor (ET), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), multiple system atrophy-cerebellar (MSA-C), and controls. Brains from 100 individuals (58 ET, 27 controls, 7 SCA, 8 MSA-C) were available at the New York Brain Bank. After complete neuropathological assessment, a standard parasagittal neocerebellar block was harvested; a 7-μm thick section was stained with Luxol fast blue/hematoxylin and eosin; and torpedoes and PCs were quantified. For a given PC count, SCA and MSA-C cases often had higher torpedo counts than ET cases or controls. Furthermore, the relationship between torpedo and PC counts was complex. The correlation between torpedo and PC counts was negative in ET cases (i.e., individuals with more torpedoes had fewer PCs [i.e., more PC loss]) whereas the relationship was positive in MSA-C cases (i.e., individuals with fewer PCs [i.e., more PC loss] had fewer torpedoes). Patients with SCA showed both patterns. When all diagnostic groups were combined, the correlation was best fit by a quadratic (i.e., parabolic) model rather than a simple linear model; this model incorporated data on the negative correlation in ET cases, the mixed results in SCA cases, and the positive correlation in MSA-C cases (r = 0.636). The relationship between torpedo and PC counts was complex and heterogeneous across a range of cerebellar disease states, and was best characterized by a quadratic rather than a simple model. With more severe cerebellar disease, torpedoes can be quite numerous and are likely a common feature of surviving PCs, but eventually, dramatic loss of PC leads to a paradoxical reduction in observable torpedoes.","2014",,"Cerebellum",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cell Death, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cerebellum, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Essential Tremor, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Postmortem Changes, FALSE, Purkinje Cells, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Spinocerebellar Ataxias, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

RESULTS: The cohort comprises 174 patients with a median age at diagnosis of IRBD of 69 years and a median follow-up of four years. The risk of a defined neurodegenerative syndrome from the time of IRBD diagnosis was 33.1% at five years, 75.7% at ten years, and 90.9% at 14 years. The median conversion time was 7.5 years.

The presence of a parastomal hernia has shown to be a risk factor for IH after midline laparotomy. Our hypothesis is that this increased risk of IH may be caused by changes in biomechanical forces, such as midline shift to the contralateral side of the colostomy owing to decreased restraining forces at the site of the colostomy, and left abdominal rectus muscle (ARM) atrophy owing to intercostal nerve damage.
METHODS: Patients were selected if they underwent end-colostomy via open operation between 2004 and 2011. Patients were eligible if computed tomography (CT) had been performed postoperatively. If available, preoperative CTs were collected for case-control analyses. Midline shift was measured using V-scope application in the I-space, a CAVE-like virtual reality system. For the ARM atrophy hypothesis, measurements of ARM were performed at the level of colostomy, and 3 and 8 cm cranial and caudal of the colostomy.
RESULTS: Postoperative CT were available for 77 patients; of these patients, 30 also had a preoperative CT. Median follow-up was 19 months. A mean shift to the right side was identified after preoperative and postoperative comparison; from -1.3 ± 4.6 to 2.1 ± 9.3 (P = .043). Furthermore, during rectus muscle measurements, a thinner left ARM was observed below the level of colostomy.
DISCUSSION: Creation of a colostomy alters the abdominal wall. Atrophy of the left ARM was seen caudal to the level of the colostomy, and a midline shift to the right side was evident on CT. These changes may explain the increased rate of IH after colostomy creation.","2014",,"Surgery",,"other","Abdominal Muscles, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Biomechanical Phenomena, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Colostomy, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Hernia, Abdominal, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Humans, FALSE, Laparoscopy, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Muscular Atrophy, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Netherlands, FALSE, Rectum, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Eight subtypes have been described thus far (PCH1-8) based on clinical and genetic features. Common characteristics include hypoplasia and atrophy of the cerebellum, variable pontine atrophy, and severe mental and motor impairments. PCH1 is distinctly characterized by the combination with degeneration of spinal motor neurons. Recently, mutations in the exosome component 3 gene (EXOSC3) have been identified in approximately half of the patients with PCH subtype 1.
METHODS: We selected a cohort of 99 PCH patients (90 families) tested negative for mutations in the TSEN genes, RARS2, VRK1 and CASK. Patients in this cohort were referred with a tentative diagnose PCH type 1, 2, 4, 7 or unclassified PCH. Genetic analysis of the EXOSC3 gene was performed using Sanger sequencing. Clinical data, MR images and autopsy reports of patients positive for EXOSC3 mutations were analyzed.
RESULTS: EXOSC3 mutations were found in twelve families with PCH subtype 1, and were not found in patients with other PCH subtypes. Identified mutations included a large deletion, nonsense and missense mutations. Examination of clinical data reveals a prolonged disease course in patients with a homozygous p.D132A mutation. MRI shows variable pontine hypoplasia in EXOSC3 mediated PCH, where the pons is largely preserved in patients with a homozygous p.D132A mutation, but attenuated in patients with other mutations. Additionally, bilateral cerebellar cysts were found in patients compound heterozygous for a p.D132A mutation and a nonsense allele.
CONCLUSIONS: EXOSC3 mediated PCH shows clear genotype-phenotype correlations. A homozygous p.D132A mutation leads to PCH with possible survival into early puberty, and preservation of the pons. Compound heterozygosity for a p.D132A mutation and a nonsense or p.Y109N allele, a homozygous p.G31A mutation or a p.G135E mutation causes a more rapidly progressive course leading to death in infancy and attenuation of the ventral pons.Our findings imply a clear correlation between genetic mutation and clinical outcome in EXOSC3 mediated PCH, including variable involvement of the pons.","2014",,"Orphanet J Rare Dis",,"other","Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Female, FALSE, Genetic Association Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, Olivopontocerebellar Atrophies, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, RNA-Binding Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Complex interactions between hyperglycemia, glycemic variability and brain aging remain unresolved. This study investigated the relationship between glycemic variability at multiple time scales, brain volumes and cognition in type 2 DM.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-three older adults with and 26 without type 2 DM completed 72-hour continuous glucose monitoring, cognitive tests and anatomical MRI. We described a new analysis of continuous glucose monitoring, termed Multi-Scale glycemic variability (Multi-Scale GV), to examine glycemic variability at multiple time scales. Specifically, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition was used to identify five unique ultradian glycemic variability cycles (GVC1-5) that modulate serum glucose with periods ranging from 0.5-12 hrs.
RESULTS: Type 2 DM subjects demonstrated greater variability in GVC3-5 (period 2.0-12 hrs) than controls (P<0.0001), during the day as well as during the night. Multi-Scale GV was related to conventional markers of glycemic variability (e.g. standard deviation and mean glycemic excursions), but demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity to conventional markers, and was associated with worse long-term glycemic control (e.g. fasting glucose and HbA1c). Across all subjects, those with greater glycemic variability within higher frequency cycles (GVC1-3; 0.5-2.0 hrs) had less gray matter within the limbic system and temporo-parietal lobes (e.g. cingulum, insular, hippocampus), and exhibited worse cognitive performance. Specifically within those with type 2 DM, greater glycemic variability in GVC2-3 was associated with worse learning and memory scores.

Recently, neuron-to-neuron transfer of α-syn was suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we explored whether a similar transfer of α-syn might occur from neurons to oligodendrocytes, which conceivably could explain how glial cytoplasmic inclusions are formed. We studied oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo and examined their ability to take up different α-syn assemblies. First, we treated oligodendrocytes with monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of α-syn proteins and investigated whether α-syn uptake is dynamin-dependent. Second, we injected the same α-syn species into the mouse cortex to assess their uptake in vivo. Finally, we monitored the presence of human α-syn within rat oligodendroglial cells grafted in the striatum of hosts displaying Adeno-Associated Virus-mediated overexpression of human α-syn in the nigro-striatal pathway. Here, we show that oligodendrocytes take up recombinant α-syn monomers, oligomers and, to a lesser extent, fibrils in vitro in a concentration and time-dependent manner, and that this process is inhibited by dynasore. Further, we demonstrate in our injection model that oligodendrocytes also internalize α-syn in vivo. Finally, we provide the first direct evidence that α-syn can transfer to grafted oligodendroglial cells from host rat brain neurons overexpressing human α-syn. Our findings support the hypothesis of a neuron-to-oligodendrocyte transfer of α-syn, a mechanism that may play a crucial role in the progression and pathogenesis of MSA.","2014",,"Glia"," We studied oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo and examined their ability to take up different α-syn assemblies ","other","2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Adenoviridae, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Animals, FALSE, Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Brain, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Cells, Cultured, FALSE, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, FALSE, Embryo, Mammalian, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Galactosylceramidase, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Hydrazones, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Male, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Myelin Proteolipid Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurons, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2, FALSE, Oligodendroglia, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Transduction, Genetic, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

DATA SOURCES: PubMed.
METHODS: PubMed search using medical subject headings ""larynx"" and ""obstructive sleep apnea."" Original articles in English related to adult patients were initially included, and the bibliographies of pertinent articles were hand-searched for additional articles.
RESULTS: A total of 17 articles were included in the review in the following subgroups: neuromuscular role of larynx (n = 3), anatomic contribution of larynx to OSA (n = 7), and special populations (n = 7). The sensory component of the superior laryngeal nerve plays a critical role in airway patency during sleep, and patients with OSA have increased endolaryngeal sensory thresholds compared to controls. Primary epiglottic obstruction in the hypopharynx represents 15% of patients with OSA unable to tolerate continuous positive airway pressure. Head and neck cancer and multiple system atrophy are two entities with high rates of OSA due in part to laryngeal abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The endolarynx warrants consideration in the pathophysiology of OSA, particularly as it relates to sensory dysfunction and epiglottic obstruction.

Several previous studies have suggested a higher incidence of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis in IBD patients. In this single-center, prospective, observational study, the authors focus on T2 focal white-matter lesions of the central nervous system on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in IBD patients that may be due to demyelination.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 70 patients with Crohn's disease were examined before beginning anti-TNF-α therapy. These patients were treated with azathioprine, mesalazine or both. Patients were examined by a neurologist to detect possible signs of demyelinating disease, and patients underwent brain MRI (native T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences).
RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (53%) exhibited abnormalities on neurological examination, and 26 patients (37%) displayed abnormalities on MRI. In seven cases, these MRI abnormalities (periventricular lesions) were suspected to be due to demyelination. Cerebral spinal fluid investigation (including polyclonal bands) was completely negative in five cases and was borderline in one case, and multiple sclerosis was confirmed in one case. Pathological MRI findings in 19 other patients were clinically nonsignificant; most were nonspecific sporadic lesions in white matter or mild atrophy.

Emerging new technologies for nucleotide sequencing such as exome sequencing has provided an exhaustive list of variants, which will eventually enable us to explore the role of low-frequency variants of large effect sizes in sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is still a statistical challenge to determine which variants are relevant to diseases among the numerous candidates, and large sample sizes will be required.

In contrast, affected boys in the family described here were born without anomalies and were neurologically normal prior to onset of seizures after 6 months of age, with two surviving to the second decade. PIGA encodes an enzyme in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. An affected individual in the family studied here was deficient in GPI anchor proteins on granulocytes but not erythrocytes.

A genome-wide association study identified EIF2AK3 as a risk factor for PSP. EIF2AK3 encodes PERK, part of the endoplasmic reticulum's (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR). PERK is an ER membrane protein that senses unfolded protein accumulation within the ER lumen. Recently, several groups noted UPR activation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, and in the hippocampus and substantia nigra of PSP subjects. Here, we evaluate UPR PERK activation in the pons, medulla, midbrain, hippocampus, frontal cortex and cerebellum in subjects with PSP, AD, and in normal controls.
RESULTS: We found UPR activation primarily in disease-affected brain regions in both disorders. In PSP, the UPR was primarily activated in the pons and medulla and to a much lesser extent in the hippocampus. In AD, the UPR was extensively activated in the hippocampus. We also observed UPR activation in the hippocampus of some elderly normal controls, severity of which positively correlated with both age and tau pathology but not with Aβ plaque burden. Finally, we evaluated EIF2AK3 coding variants that influence PERK activation. We show that a haplotype associated with increased PERK activation is genetically associated with increased PSP risk.

Lipid contents, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG), were evaluated. The unified MSA rating scale (UMSARS) was used to assess the severity of MSA.
RESULTS: Lipid levels in MSA patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls. Patients with MSA-C were significantly younger, had higher body mass indices (BMIs), higher UMSARS scores, and lower HDL-C contents compared with MSA-P patients. Subjects with the lowest quartiles and the second quartiles of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C had high prevalence of MSA compared with subjects with the highest quartiles.

The cutaneous signs--papular skin lesions with central porcelain-white atrophy and surrounding telangiectatic rim--are almost pathognomonic. Extracutaneous, systemic involvement includes multiple limited infarcts of the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system and other organs.
OBJECTIVES: To assess prospectively the demographics, epidemiological data and prognosis of patients with atrophic papulosis evaluated in a single centre.
METHODS: A prospective, single-centre, cohort study at diagnosis was performed on a series of 39 patients with atrophic papulosis, first seen between 2000 and 2007 and evaluated up to 2012.
RESULTS: The occurrence of cutaneous lesions defined the onset of disease in all cases. The mean age of onset was 35.4 ± 12.3 years and the male-to-female ratio was 1 : 1.4. In total, 9% of patients reported familial occurrence. Extracutaneous (systemic) signs were recorded in 29% of the patients, whereas the median time for development of systemic manifestations was 1 year (0.03-0.97 quantiles: 0-7 years) after the occurrence of cutaneous lesions. The prognosis was determined mainly by the presence of systemic involvement. 73% of the patients with systemic manifestations (73% developed intestinal perforation) died, while none of the patients with only cutaneous disease had a lethal outcome. The cumulative 5-year survival rate in patients with systemic disease was 54.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic papulosis, previously called malignant atrophic papulosis, should be classified into a malignant, systemic form and a benign, cutaneous one, the latter being more common.

The epigenetic bases of chronic gastritis, mainly DNA methylation, are presented through examples such as (i) the methylation of the promoter region of E-cadherin in HP-induced chronic gastritis and its reversion after HP eradication and (ii) the association of methylation of the promoter region of Reprimo, a p53-mediated cell cycle arrest gene, with aggressive HP strains in high risk areas for GC. In addition, we discuss the finding of RPRM as a circulating cell-free DNA, offering the opportunity for noninvasive risk assessment of GC. Finally, the integration of OLGA and tissue biomarkers, by systems pathology approach, suggests that severe atrophy has a greater risk for GC development if, in addition, overexpressed p73.

Since higher copy numbers of the nearly identical SMN2 gene reduce disease severity, to date most efforts to develop a therapy for SMA have focused on enhancing SMN expression. Identification of alternative therapeutic approaches has partly been hindered by limited knowledge of potential targets and the lack of cell-based screening assays that serve as readouts of SMN function. Here, we established a cell system in which proliferation of cultured mouse fibroblasts is dependent on functional SMN produced from the SMN2 gene. To do so, we introduced the entire human SMN2 gene into NIH3T3 cell lines in which regulated knockdown of endogenous mouse Smn severely decreases cell proliferation. We found that low SMN2 copy number has modest effects on the cell proliferation phenotype induced by Smn depletion, while high SMN2 copy number is strongly protective. Additionally, cell proliferation correlates with the level of SMN activity in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein assembly. Following miniaturization into a high-throughput format, our cell-based phenotypic assay accurately measures the beneficial effects of both pharmacological and genetic treatments leading to SMN upregulation. This cell model provides a novel platform for phenotypic screening of modifiers of SMN2 gene expression and function that act through multiple mechanisms, and a powerful new tool for studies of SMN biology and SMA therapeutic development.","2013",,"PLoS One",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Gene Knockdown Techniques, FALSE, Gene Order, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, NIH 3T3 Cells, FALSE, Phenotype, TRUE, Protein Transport, FALSE, RNA Interference, FALSE, Survival of Motor Neuron 2 Protein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: The consensus statement was generated during the fourth IRBD-SG symposium in Marburg, Germany in 2011. The IRBD-SG identified essential methodologic components for a randomized trial in RBD, including potential screening and diagnostic criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary and secondary outcomes for symptomatic therapy trials (particularly for melatonin and clonazepam), and potential primary and secondary outcomes for eventual trials with disease-modifying and neuroprotective agents. The latter trials are considered urgent, given the high conversion rate from idiopathic RBD (iRBD) to Parkinsonian disorders (i.e., PD, dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], multiple system atrophy [MSA]).
RESULTS: Six inclusion criteria were identified for symptomatic therapy and neuroprotective trials: (1) diagnosis of RBD needs to satisfy the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition, (ICSD-2) criteria; (2) minimum frequency of RBD episodes should preferably be ⩾2 times weekly to allow for assessment of change; (3) if the PD-RBD target population is included, it should be in the early stages of PD defined as Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3 in Off (untreated); (4) iRBD patients with soft neurologic dysfunction and with operational criteria established by the consensus of study investigators; (5) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI); and (6) optimally treated comorbid OSA. Twenty-four exclusion criteria were identified. The primary outcome measure for RBD treatment trials was determined to be the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) efficacy index, consisting of a four-point scale with a four-point side-effect scale. Assessment of video-polysomnographic (vPSG) changes holds promise but is costly and needs further elaboration. Secondary outcome measures include sleep diaries; sleepiness scales; PD sleep scale 2 (PDSS-2); serial motor examinations; cognitive indices; mood and anxiety indices; assessment of frequency of falls, gait impairment, and apathy; fatigue severity scale; and actigraphy and customized bed alarm systems. Consensus also was established for evaluating the clinical and vPSG aspects of RBD. End points for neuroprotective trials in RBD, taking lessons from research in PD, should be focused on the ultimate goal of determining the performance of disease-modifying agents. To date no compound with convincing evidence of disease-modifying or neuroprotective efficacy has been identified in PD. Nevertheless, iRBD patients are considered ideal candidates for neuroprotective studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The IRBD-SG provides an important platform for developing multinational collaborative studies on RBD such as on environmental risk factors for iRBD, as recently reported in a peer-reviewed journal article, and on controlled active treatment studies for symptomatic and neuroprotective therapy that emerged during the 2011 consensus conference in Marburg, Germany, as described in our report.","2013",,"Sleep Med"," OBJECTIVES : We aimed to provide a consensus statement by the International Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Study Group ( IRBD-SG ) on devising controlled active treatment studies in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) and devising studies of neuroprotection against Parkinson disease ( PD ) and","other","Clinical Trials as Topic, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Clonazepam, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Consensus, FALSE, GABA Modulators, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Humans, FALSE, Melatonin, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Neuroprotective Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, leading to weakness and muscle atrophy. SMA occurs as a result of homozygous deletion or mutations in Survival Motor Neuron-1 (SMN1). Loss of SMN1 leads to a dramatic reduction in SMN protein, which is essential for motor neuron survival. SMA disease severity ranges from extremely severe to a relatively mild adult onset form of proximal muscle atrophy. Severe SMA patients typically die mostly within months or a few years as a consequence of respiratory insufficiency and bulbar paralysis. SMA is widely known as a motor neuron disease; however, there are numerous clinical reports indicating the involvement of additional peripheral organs contributing to the complete picture of the disease in severe cases. In this review, we have compiled clinical and experimental reports that demonstrate the association between the loss of SMN and peripheral organ deficiency and malfunction.

Multiple mechanisms are involved in determination of kidney glomerular, tubular and interstitial injuries in hypertension. The present review article discusses relevant contributory molecular mechanisms underpinning the promotion of hypertensive renal damage, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and genetic and epigenetic determinants. We highlighted major pathways involved in the progression of inflammation and fibrosis leading to glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus providing a state of the art review of the pathogenetic background useful for a better understanding of current and future therapeutic strategies toward hypertensive nephropathy. An adequate control of high blood pressure, obtained through an appropriate therapeutic intervention, still represents the key strategy to achieve a satisfactory control of renal damage in hypertension. In this regard, we reviewed the impact of currently available antihypertensive pharmacological treatment on kidney damage, with particular regard to RAAS inhibitors. Notably, recent findings underscored the ability of the kidneys to regenerate and to repair tissue injuries through the differentiation of resident embryonic stem cells. Pharmacological modulation of the renal endogenous reparative process (that is, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 angiotensin II receptor blockers), as well as future therapeutic strategies targeted to the renopoietic system, offers interesting perspectives for the management of hypertensive nephropathy.","2014",,"J Hum Hypertens",," review","Animals, FALSE, Antihypertensive Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Blood Pressure, TRUE, drug effects, Q000187, Endothelium, Vascular, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hypertension, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Inflammation Mediators, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Kidney, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Kidney Diseases, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Oxidative Stress, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Renin-Angiotensin System, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Signal Transduction, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Although multiple-system atrophy is widely considered to be a nongenetic disorder, we previously identified multiplex families with this disease, which indicates the involvement of genetic components.
METHODS: In combination with linkage analysis, we performed whole-genome sequencing of a sample obtained from a member of a multiplex family in whom multiple-system atrophy had been diagnosed on autopsy. We also performed mutational analysis of samples from members of five other multiplex families and from a Japanese series (363 patients and two sets of controls, one of 520 persons and one of 2383 persons), a European series (223 patients and 315 controls), and a North American series (172 patients and 294 controls). On the basis of these analyses, we used a yeast complementation assay and measured enzyme activity of parahydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase. This enzyme is encoded by the gene COQ2 and is essential for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10. Levels of coenzyme Q10 in lymphoblastoid cells and brain tissue were measured on high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: We identified a homozygous mutation (M78V-V343A/M78V-V343A) and compound heterozygous mutations (R337X/V343A) in COQ2 in two multiplex families. Furthermore, we found that a common variant (V343A) and multiple rare variants in COQ2, all of which are functionally impaired, are associated with sporadic multiple-system atrophy. The V343A variant was exclusively observed in the Japanese population.
CONCLUSIONS: Functionally impaired variants of COQ2 were associated with an increased risk of multiple-system atrophy in multiplex families and patients with sporadic disease, providing evidence of a role of impaired COQ2 activities in the pathogenesis of this disease.

DESIGN: Case series.
PARTICIPANTS: 22 children with nodding syndrome brought to Mulago National Referral Hospital for assessment.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features, physical and functional disabilities, EEG and brain MRI findings and a staging system with a progressive development of symptoms and complications.
RESULTS: The median age of symptom onset was 6 (range 4-10) years and median duration of symptoms was 8.5 (range 2-11) years. 16 of 22 families reported multiple affected children. Physical manifestations and complications included stunting, wasting, lip changes and gross physical deformities. The bone age was delayed by 2 (range 1-6) years. There was peripheral muscle wasting and progressive generalised wasting. Four children had nodding as the only seizure type; 18 in addition had myoclonic, absence and/or generalised tonic-clonic seizures developing 1-3 years after the onset of illness. Psychiatric manifestations included wandering, aggression, depression and disordered perception. Cognitive assessment in three children demonstrated profound impairment. The EEG was abnormal in all, suggesting symptomatic generalised epilepsy in the majority. There were different degrees of cortical and cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI, but no hippocampal changes. Five stages with worsening physical, EEG and brain imaging features were identified: a prodrome, the development of head nodding and cognitive decline, other seizure types, multiple complications and severe disability.

METHODS: Patients from an IRBD cohort recruited between 1991 and 2003, and previously assessed in 2005, were followed up during an additional period of 7 years. In this original cohort, we sought to identify the nature and frequency of emerging defined neurodegenerative syndromes diagnosed by standard clinical criteria. We estimated rates of survival free from defined neurodegenerative disease by means of the Kaplan-Meier method. We further characterised individuals who remained diagnosed as having only IRBD, through dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, transcranial sonography (TCS), and olfactory testing. We did a neuropathological assessment in three patients who died during follow-up and who had the antemortem diagnosis of PD or DLB.
FINDINGS: Of the 44 participants from the original cohort, 36 (82%) had developed a defined neurodegenerative syndrome by the 2012 assessment (16 patients were diagnosed with PD, 14 with DLB, one with multiple system atrophy, and five with mild cognitive impairment). The rates of neurological-disease-free survival from time of IRBD diagnosis were 65·2% (95% CI 50·9 to 79·5) at 5 years, 26·6% (12·7 to 40·5) at 10 years, and 7·5% (-1·9 to 16·9) at 14 years. Of the four remaining neurological-disease-free individuals who underwent neuroimaging and olfactory tests, all four had decreased striatal DAT uptake, one had substantia nigra hyperechogenicity on TCS, and two had impaired olfaction. In three patients, the antemortem diagnoses of PD and DLB were confirmed by neuropathological examination showing widespread Lewy bodies in the brain, and α-synuclein aggregates in the peripheral autonomic nervous system in one case. In these three patients, neuronal loss and Lewy pathology (α-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) were found in the brainstem nuclei that regulate REM sleep atonia.
INTERPRETATION: Most IRBD individuals from our cohort developed a Lewy body disorder with time. Patients who remained disease-free at follow-up showed markers of increased short-term risk for developing PD and DLB in IRBD, such as decreased striatal DAT binding. Our findings indicate that in most patients diagnosed with IRBD this parasomnia represents the prodromal phase of a Lewy body disorder. IRBD is a candidate for the study of early events and progression of this prodromal phase, and to test disease-modifying strategies to slow or stop the neurodegenerative process.

They are responsible for a significant morbidity and mortality and impair patients' quality of life. The therapeutic management of these LUTD requires to know how to distinguish the PD from other PS and their epidemiology and pathophysiology.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a diagnostic and therapeutic management of LUTD in patients with PS.
METHOD: A review of litterature using PubMed library was performed using the following keywords: Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, lower urinary tract disorders, neurogenic bladder, overactive bladder, obstruction, anticholinergics, dopamine, prostate surgery.
RESULTS: Sometimes revealing the neurological disease, LUTD in PS raise a diagnostic problem because they occur at an age when various urogynecological disorders can be intricated with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The differential diagnosis between PD and multiple system atrophy is important to know by the urologist. The distinction is based on the semiological analysis, the clinical response to dopaminergic therapy and the clinical outcome but also on data from urodynamic explorations. The therapeutic management of these LUTD cannot be easy due to the difficulty of use of some pharmacological treatments and the risk of deterioration after inappropriate surgery. The different treatments include the careful use of anticholinergics, posterior tibial nerve stimulation, deep thalamic stimulation and low-dose intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxin without approval. The decision to perform prostate surgery will be taken with caution after proving the bladder obstruction.
CONCLUSION: When analysing LUTD in PS, the urologist must know to question the initial diagnosis of PD. Treatments in order to reduce morbidity and mortality of these LUTD and to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from these degenerative diseases, will be proposed after multidisciplinary neuro-urologic concertation.

The most important implication of research into this area is that patients with idiopathic RBD are at very high risk of developing synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative disease (Parkinson's disease [PD], dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], and multiple system atrophy), with risk estimates that approximate 40-65% at 10 years. Thus, RBD disorder is a very strong feature of prodromal synucleinopathy. This provides several opportunities for future research. First, patients with REM sleep behavior disorder can be studied to test other predictors of disease, which could potentially be applied to the general population. These studies have demonstrated that olfactory loss, decreased color vision, slowing on quantitative motor testing, and abnormal substantia nigra neuroimaging findings can predict clinical synucleinopathy. Second, prospectively studying patients with RBD allows a completely unprecedented opportunity to directly evaluate patients as they transition into clinical neurodegenerative disease. Studies assessing progression of markers of neurodegeneration in prodromal PD are beginning to appear. Third, RBD are very promising subjects for neuroprotective therapy trials because they have a high risk of disease conversion with a sufficiently long latency, which provides an opportunity for early intervention.

RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with primary dopaminergic deficiencies were identified. Of the whole sample, 20% showed altered HVA. We report neurological diseases with abnormal CSF HVA values such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia, perinatal asphyxia, central nervous system infections, mitochondrial disorders, and other genetic diseases. Overlapping HVA levels between primary and secondary dopamine deficiencies were observed. Prevalence of low CSF HVA levels was significantly higher in neonatal patients (χ(2) =84.8, p<0.001). Abnormalities in white matter were associated with low CSF HVA (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.5).
INTERPRETATION: HVA abnormalities are observed in various neurological diseases, but some are probably an unspecific finding. No clear limits for CSF HVA values pointing towards primary diseases can be stated. We report several neurological diseases showing HVA alterations. No neuroimaging traits were associated with low HVA values, except for white matter abnormalities.","2013",,"Dev Med Child Neurol"," AIM : To determine the prevalence of dopaminergic abnormalities in 1388 children with neurological disorders , and to analyse their clinical , neuroradiological , and electrophysiological characteristics ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Algorithms, FALSE, Asphyxia Neonatorum, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Central Nervous System Infections, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Dopamine, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Female, FALSE, Homovanillic Acid, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Humans, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Internationality, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mitochondrial Diseases, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Olivopontocerebellar Atrophies, FALSE, cerebrospinal fluid, Q000134, Radiography, FALSE, Sampling Studies, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Here we present the final analysis of a prospective multicentre study by the European MSA Study Group to investigate the natural history of MSA.
METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of MSA were recruited and followed up clinically for 2 years. Vital status was ascertained 2 years after study completion. Disease progression was assessed using the unified MSA rating scale (UMSARS), a disease-specific questionnaire that enables the semiquantitative rating of autonomic and motor impairment in patients with MSA. Additional rating methods were applied to grade global disease severity, autonomic symptoms, and quality of life. Survival was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis and predictors were identified in a Cox regression model. Group differences were analysed by parametric tests and non-parametric tests as appropriate. Sample size estimates were calculated using a paired two-group t test.
FINDINGS: 141 patients with moderately severe disease fulfilled the consensus criteria for MSA. Mean age at symptom onset was 56·2 (SD 8·4) years. Median survival from symptom onset as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 9·8 years (95% CI 8·1-11·4). The parkinsonian variant of MSA (hazard ratio [HR] 2·08, 95% CI 1·09-3·97; p=0·026) and incomplete bladder emptying (HR 2·10, 1·02-4·30; p=0·044) predicted shorter survival. 24-month progression rates of UMSARS activities of daily living, motor examination, and total scores were 49% (9·4 [SD 5·9]), 74% (12·9 [8·5]), and 57% (21·9 [11·9]), respectively, relative to baseline scores. Autonomic symptom scores progressed throughout the follow-up. Shorter symptom duration at baseline (OR 0·68, 0·5-0·9; p=0·006) and absent levodopa response (OR 3·4, 1·1-10·2; p=0·03) predicted rapid UMSARS progression. Sample size estimation showed that an interventional trial with 258 patients (129 per group) would be able to detect a 30% effect size in 1-year UMSARS motor examination decline rates at 80% power.
INTERPRETATION: Our prospective dataset provides new insights into the evolution of MSA based on a follow-up period that exceeds that of previous studies.

The etiology of these disorders is not known although it is considered to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. One of the greatest obstacles for developing efficacious disease-modifying treatment strategies is the lack of biomarkers. Reliable biomarkers are needed for early and accurate diagnosis, to measure disease progression, and response to therapy. In this review several of the most promising cerebrospinal biomarker candidates are discussed. Alpha-synuclein seems to be intimately involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies and its levels can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma. In a similar way, tau protein accumulation seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. Urate, a potent antioxidant, seems to be associated to the risk of developing PD and with its progression. Neurofilament light chain levels are increased in APD compared with PD and healthy controls.

We undertook this study to assess the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in the differential diagnosis of individual patients with clinical parkinsonism. ""Visual"" and ""computer-supported"" reading of the fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans were used for image interpretation and compared with each other.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-six parkinsonian patients were referred from movement disorder clinics in specialty neurology centers for the fluorodeoxyglucose-PET study. Imaging-based diagnosis was obtained by visual assessment of individual scans by a PET physician blinded to the clinical diagnosis and also by computer-assisted interpretation using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. The results were compared with a 2-year follow-up clinical assessment made by a movement disorder specialist.
RESULTS: Concordance of visual evaluation of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET with clinical diagnosis was achieved in 91.7% of patients scanned, 97.6% IPD, 80% MSA, 76.6% PSP, and 100% CBS. Blinded computer assessment using SPM was concordant with the clinical diagnosis in 91% of cases evaluated (90.4% IPD, 80% MSA, 93.3% PSP, and 100% CBS).

The drug targets the cardiovascular system as well via sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors. After initiation of fingolimod therapy transient sinus bradycardia and slowing of the atrioventricular conduction develops. The onset of the effect is as early as 1 hour post administration, while heart rate and conduction normalized in 24 hours in most of the cases.

The incidence of Mobitz I type II atrioventricular blocks and blocks with 2:1 atrioventricular conduction was 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. All of these cardiovascular events showed regression during observation and no higher degree atrioventricular blocks were detected at the approved therapeutic dose.

Gene defects had been discovered only in single patients until the recent identification of EXOSC3 mutations in several families with relatively mild course of PCH1. We aim to genetically stratify subjects in a large and well-defined cohort to define the clinical spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation.
METHODS: We documented clinical, neuroimaging, and morphologic data of 37 subjects from 27 families with PCH1. EXOSC3 gene sequencing was performed in 27 unrelated index patients of mixed ethnicity.
RESULTS: Biallelic mutations in EXOSC3 were detected in 10 of 27 families (37%). The most common mutation among all ethnic groups was c.395A>C, p.D132A, responsible for 11 (55%) of the 20 mutated alleles and ancestral in origin. The mutation-positive subjects typically presented with normal pregnancy, normal birth measurements, and relative preservation of brainstem and cortical structures. Psychomotor retardation was profound in all patients but lifespan was variable, with 3 subjects surviving beyond the late teens. Abnormal oculomotor function was commonly observed in patients surviving beyond the first year. Major clinical features previously reported in PCH1, including intrauterine abnormalities, postnatal hypoventilation and feeding difficulties, joint contractures, and neonatal death, were rarely observed in mutation-positive infants but were typical among the mutation-negative subjects.

METHODS: Following the EFNS instruction for the preparation of neurological diagnostic guidelines, recommendation levels have been generated for diagnostic criteria and investigations.
RESULTS: For the clinical diagnosis, we recommend the use of the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria (Level B). Genetic testing for specific mutations is recommended on an individual basis (Level B), taking into account specific features (i.e. family history and age of onset). We recommend olfactory testing to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian disorders including recessive forms (Level A). Screening for pre-motor PD with olfactory testing requires additional tests due to limited specificity. Drug challenge tests are not recommended for the diagnosis in de novo parkinsonian patients. There is an insufficient evidence to support their role in the differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. We recommend an assessment of cognition and a screening for REM sleep behaviour disorder, psychotic manifestations and severe depression in the initial evaluation of suspected PD cases (Level A). Transcranial sonography is recommended for the differentiation of PD from atypical and secondary parkinsonian disorders (Level A), for the early diagnosis of PD and in the detection of subjects at risk for PD (Level A), although the technique is so far not universally used and requires some expertise. Because specificity of TCS for the development of PD is limited, TCS should be used in conjunction with other screening tests. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging at 1.5 T are recommended as neuroimaging tools that can support a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy versus PD on the basis of regional atrophy and signal change as well as diffusivity patterns (Level A). DaTscan SPECT is registered in Europe and the United States for the differential diagnosis between degenerative parkinsonisms and essential tremor (Level A). More specifically, DaTscan is indicated in the presence of significant diagnostic uncertainty such as parkinsonism associated with neuroleptic exposure and atypical tremor manifestations such as isolated unilateral postural tremor. Studies of [(123) I]MIBG/SPECT cardiac uptake may be used to identify patients with PD versus controls and MSA patients (Level A). All other SPECT imaging studies do not fulfil registration standards and cannot be recommended for routine clinical use. At the moment, no conclusion can be drawn as to diagnostic efficacy of autonomic function tests, neurophysiological tests and positron emission tomography imaging in PD.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of PD is still largely based on the correct identification of its clinical features. Selected investigations (genetic, olfactory, and neuroimaging studies) have an ancillary role in confirming the diagnosis, and some of them could be possibly used in the near future to identify subjects in a pre-symptomatic phase of the disease.","2013",,"Eur J Neurol",," review","Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Databases, Factual, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Diagnostic Imaging, FALSE, Europe, FALSE, Genetic Testing, FALSE, Guidelines as Topic, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Neurophysiology, FALSE, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, Olfaction Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sleep Wake Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

It was recently suggested that autoimmunity, which had long been considered to be destructive in MS, might also play a protective role in the CNS of MS patients. Neurotrophins are polypeptides belonging to the neurotrophic factor family. While neurotrophins mediate cell survival and proliferation in the nervous system, they are also expressed within peripheral blood mononuclear cells fraction (PBMCs) of immunological system. In MS additional neurotrophic support from PBMCs might compensate relative neurotrophins deficiency in the damaged CNS tissue that needs to be repaired. Failure to produce the adequate neurotrophins concentrations might result in decreased protection of the CNS, consequently leading to increased atrophy, which is the main determinant of MS patients' end-point disability. There are several lines of evidence, both from clinical research and animal models, suggesting that neurotrophins play a pivotal role in neuroprotective and neuroregenerative processes that are often defective in the course of MS.

Loss of SMN1 coupled with the predominant skipping of SMN2 exon 7 causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disease. SMA patient cells devoid of SMN1 provide a powerful system to examine splicing pattern of various SMN2 exons. Until now, similar system to examine splicing of SMN1 exons was unavailable. We have recently screened several patient cell lines derived from various diseases, including SMA, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Batten disease. Here we report a Batten disease cell line that lacks functional SMN2, as an ideal system to examine pre-mRNA splicing of SMN1. We employ a multiple-exon-skipping detection assay (MESDA) to capture simultaneously skipping of multiple exons. Our results show surprising diversity of splice isoforms and reveal novel splicing events that include skipping of exon 4 and co-skipping of three adjacent exons of SMN. Contrary to the general belief, MESDA captured oxidative-stress induced skipping of SMN1 exon 5 in several cell types, including non-neuronal cells. We further demonstrate that the predominant SMN2 exon 7 skipping induced by oxidative stress is modulated by a combinatorial control that includes promoter sequence, endogenous context, and the weak splice sites. We also show that an 8-mer antisense oligonucleotide blocking a recently described GC-rich sequence prevents SMN2 exon 7 skipping under the conditions of oxidative stress.

METHODS: The SET study comprised 220 patients with clinically isolated syndrome treated with interferon beta (mean age, 29 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale, 1.5). Three patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Physical disability, time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and volumetric MRI data were recorded for 2 years.
RESULTS: Patients reaching clinically definite multiple sclerosis showed impaired recovery of neurological function, faster decrease in corpus callosum cross-sectional area, higher T2 lesion volume and more contrast-enhancing lesions. Six-month decrease in corpus callosum cross-sectional area (≥ 1%) and baseline T2 lesion volume (≥ 5 cm(3)) predicted clinically definite multiple sclerosis within 2 years (hazard ratios 2.5 and 1.8, respectively). Of 22 patients fulfilling both predictive criteria, 83% reached clinically definite multiple sclerosis (hazard ratio 6.5). More relapses were associated with poorer recovery of neurological function and accelerated brain atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurological impairment is more permanent, brain atrophy is accelerated and focal inflammatory activity is greater in patients converting to clinically definite multiple sclerosis.

In the present study, we extended the screening of GBA gene L444P mutation to Chinese patients with essential tremor (ET) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We searched for the GBA gene L444P mutation in 109 patients with ET, 54 patients with MSA, and 657 controls from mainland China. None of the 109 patients with ET or 54 patients with MSA carried the GBA gene L444P mutation. Among the 657 controls, we found one L444P heterozygote. The difference in mutation frequencies between patients with ET or MSA and the control group was not statistically significant (chi-squared test, p = 1, respectively). The results suggest that the GBA gene L444P mutation may be not responsible for ET in mainland China. Whether the GBA gene L444P mutation modifies the risk for MSA deserves further study in larger samples.","2013",,"J Clin Neurosci",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Amino Acid Substitution, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Asian People, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, China, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Essential Tremor, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Female, FALSE, Genetic Association Studies, TRUE, methods, Q000379, Glucosylceramidase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Mutation, TRUE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, the prevalence and determinants of EDS in other ethnic populations have not been reported to date.
METHODS: We performed a single-hospital prospective study on patients with probable MSA. To ascertain the prevalence and determinants of EDS in Japanese MSA patients, we assessed the patients' degree of daytime sleepiness by using the Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In addition, we investigated the effects of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and abnormal periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS), which were measured by polysomnography, on the patients' ESS scores.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients with probable MSA (21 patients with cerebellar MSA and 4 patients with parkinsonian MSA) were included in this study. All patients underwent standard polysomnography. The mean ESS score was 6.2 ± 0.9, and EDS was identified in 24% of the patients. SDB and abnormal PLMS were identified in 24 (96%) and 11 (44%) patients, respectively. The prevalences of EDS in patients with SDB and abnormal PLMS were 25% and 18%, respectively. No correlations were observed between ESS scores and the parameters of SDB or abnormal PLMS.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of EDS in Japanese patients with MSA was similar to that in Caucasian MSA patients.

The most common symptoms are orthostatic hypotension, incontinence and constipation, but its relevance in clinical practice is poorly understood. There are no earlier studies addressing the influence of autonomic dysfunction on clinical course and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of the three most common features of autonomic dysfunction and analyze how it affects survival.
METHODS: Thirty patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease with dementia were included in this prospective, longitudinal follow-up study. Presence of incontinence and constipation was recorded at baseline. Blood pressure was measured at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months according to standardized procedures, with 5 measurements during 10 minutes after rising. Orthostatic hypotension was defined using consensus definitions and persistent orthostatic hypotension was defined as 5 or more measurements with orthostatic hypotension. Difference in survival was analyzed 36 months after baseline.
RESULTS: There was a high frequency of persistent orthostatic blood pressure (50%), constipation (30%) and incontinence (30%). Patients with persistent orthostatic hypotension had a significantly shorter survival compared to those with no or non-persistent orthostatic hypotension (Log rank x(2) = 4.47, p = 0.034). Patients with constipation and/or urinary incontinence, in addition to persistent orthostatic hypotension, had a poorer prognosis compared to those with isolated persistent orthostatic hypotension or no orthostatic hypotension (Log rank x(2) = 6.370, p = 0.041).
DISCUSSION: According to our findings, the identification of autonomic dysfunction seems to be of great importance in clinical practice, not only to avoid falls and other complications, but also as a possible predictor of survival.","2012",,"PLoS One"," The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of the three most common features of autonomic dysfunction and analyze how it affects survival ","other","Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Constipation, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Disease Progression, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, FALSE, Lewy Body Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Shy-Drager Syndrome, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Urinary Incontinence, FALSE, etiology, Q000209",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Physical activity, or exercise, requires a range of integrated autonomic and cardiovascular adjustments in order to maintain homeostasis. Pathological conditions that result in dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, such as autonomic failure, can therefore jeopardize the control of blood pressure resulting in hypotension and have serious implications for health. Exercise induced hypotension, defined as a ≥ 10 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure during exercise, can be a significant symptom/event for autonomic failure, as well as other autonomic disorder, patients, including, Multiple System Atrophy and Spinal Cord Injury, and can reduce physical capacity, orthostatic tolerance, result in falls, complicate management and reduce quality of life. The likely mechanisms do not appear to be an altered cardiac output or active muscle vasodilation response to exercise, but rather, a lack of and/or a blunted increase in sympathetic nerve activity during exercise and/or excessive vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation. The severity of exercise induced hypotension seems to be higher during dynamic relative to static exercise. The possible management strategies for exercise induced hypotension include both non-pharmacological, e.g., reducing risk factors, and pharmacological measures, such as sympathomimetics, but studies on other pharmacological agents are limited.","2012",,"Auton Neurosci",," review","Animals, FALSE, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Blood Pressure, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cardiovascular System, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Exercise, TRUE, Heart Rate, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Humans, FALSE, Hypotension, FALSE, etiology, Q000209",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

SIRT2 is a strong deacetylase that is highly expressed in brain. It has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a dopaminergic neurotoxin that replicates most of the clinical features of Parkinson disease (PD) and produces a reliable and reproducible lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and neurodegeneration after its systemic administration. Chronic administration of MPTP induces lesion via apoptosis. We show here that SIRT2 deacetylates Foxo3a, increases RNA and protein levels of Bim, and as a result, enhances apoptosis in the MPTP model of PD. We also show that neurodegeneration induced by chronic MPTP regimen is prevented by genetic deletion of SIRT2 in mouse. Deletion of SIRT2 leads to the reduction of apoptosis due to an increase in acetylation of Foxo3a and a decrease in Bim levels. We demonstrate that SIRT2 deacetylates Foxo3a, activates Bim, and induces apoptosis only in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-treated cells.

Of these, RBD is the most common (affecting 90 %-100 % of patients with MSA) and is regarded as a red flag for MSA. RBD, as well as stridor during sleep, may be the initial manifestation of the disease, occurring several years before the waking motor and dysautonomic onset. Sleep disorders occur in both MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) and MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). Treatment strategies in patients with MSA presenting difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep need to be highly individualized. Clonazepam has been found to be successful in treating RBD symptoms at the dose of 0.25 to 2.0 mg given approximately 30 min before bedtime. In case of comorbid obstructive sleep apnea, zopiclone (at the dose from 3.75 to 7.5 mg each night) or melatonin (with a recommended dose of 3 to 12 mg at bedtime) may be alternative treatments. An increased survival in MSA patients with stridor may be obtained both with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and tracheostomy. Since tracheostomy is an invasive surgical procedure, not easily accepted by the patient, CPAP therapy should be considered first. However, tracheostomy is first indicated when stridor is present during wakefulness because of the high risk of respiratory failure and death. In MSA, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs more frequently than central sleep apnea, ranging from 15 % to 37 % of the cases. CPAP is an effective treatment for eliminating obstructive sleep apnea in MSA patients, even if the adaptation to the device may be difficult in advanced cases.","2012",,"Curr Treat Options Neurol",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Population-based prospective data on the risk of developing components of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), however, are limited.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 9,628 women screened during their first prenatal appointment in Chile, which identified 101 who consumed at least 4 drinks/d (exposed) matched with 101 women with no reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy (unexposed). Detailed alcohol consumption data were collected during the pregnancy. Children were evaluated up to 8.5 years of age by clinicians masked to exposure status.
RESULTS: One or more functional central nervous system abnormalities were present in 44.0% (22/50) of the exposed children compared to 13.6% (6/44) of the unexposed (p = 0.002). Growth restriction was present in 27.2% (25/92) of the exposed and 12.5% (12/96) of the unexposed (p = 0.02). Abnormal facial features were present in 17.3% (14/81) of the exposed children compared to 1.1% (1/89) of the unexposed children (p = 0.0002) by direct examination.

Schizophrenia is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders. Accumulating evidence has indicated the involvement of the Akt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Genetic linkage and association studies have identified Akt-1 as a candidate susceptibility gene related for schizophrenia. The level of Akt-1 protein and its kinase activity decreased significantly both in white blood cells from schizophrenic patients and in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenic patients. Consistent with these findings, alterations in the upstream and downstream pathways of Akt have also been found in many psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs modify the Akt signaling pathway in a variety of conditions relative to schizophrenia. In addition as a survival kinase, Akt participates in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, protein synthesis and neurotransmission in the central nervous system. It is thought that reduced activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway could at least partially explain the cognitive impairment, synaptic morphologic abnormality, neuronal atrophy and dysfunction of neurotransmitter signaling in schizophrenia. In addition, reduced levels of Akt may increase the effects of risk factors on neurodevelopment, attenuate the effects of growth factors on neurodevelopment and reduce the response of patients to antipsychotic agents. More recently, the role of Akt signaling in the functions of schizophrenia susceptibility genes such as disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC-1), neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) and dysbindin-1 has been reported. Thus, Akt deficiency may create a context permissive for the expression of risk-gene effects in neuronal morphology and function.

To elucidate the impact of LAQ on CNS-intrinsic inflammation, we investigated the effects of LAQ on cuprizone-induced demyelination in mice in vivo and on primary CNS cells in vitro. Demyelination, inflammation, axonal damage and glial pathology were evaluated in LAQ-treated wild type and Rag-1-deficient mice after cuprizone challenge. Using primary cells we tested for effects of LAQ on oligodendroglial survival as well as on cytokine secretion and NF-κB activation in astrocytes and microglia. LAQ prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination, microglial activation, axonal transections, reactive gliosis and oligodendroglial apoptoses in wild type and Rag-1-deficient mice. LAQ significantly decreased pro-inflammatory factors in stimulated astrocytes, but not in microglia. Oligodendroglial survival was not affected by LAQ in vitro. Astrocytic, but not microglial, NF-κB activation was markedly reduced by LAQ as evidenced by NF-κB reporter assay. LAQ also significantly decreased astrocytic NF-κB activation in cuprizone-treated mice. Our data indicate that LAQ prevents cuprizone-induced demyelination by attenuating astrocytic NF-κB activation. These effects are CNS-intrinsic and not mediated by peripheral immune cells.

Recent studies have suggested that it can also be observed in normal subjects at 3 T. Whether it can be observed in normal subjects at 1.5 T is not known. This study aimed to determine whether HPR could be observed in normal subjects at 1.5 T; and if so, to establish its prevalence, the MRI characteristics, and the features which distinguish from HPR in MSA patients.
METHODS: Axial T2-weighted images of 130 normal subjects were evaluated for the prevalence of HPR, its age and gender distribution, laterality, maximum dimension, association with hypointensity of nearby putamen, and presence of discontinuity. To distinguish from that observed in MSA, axial T2-weighted images of 6 MSA patients with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) and 15 MSA patients with predominant cerebellar symptoms (MSA-C) were also evaluated. The characteristics of HPR were compared between these patients and age-matched normal subjects. The mean diffusivity (MD) values of putamen were also compared. Fisher's exact test, t-test, and one way analysis of variance were used to determine significance at corrected p < 0.05.
RESULTS: HPR was observed in 38.5% of normal subjects. Age and gender predilection and laterality were not observed. In most cases, it occupied the full length or anterior half of the lateral margin of putamen, and was continuous throughout its length. Maximum transverse dimension was 2 mm. There was no association with hypointensity of nearby putamen. However, in MSA-P, HPR was located predominantly at the posterolateral aspect of putamen, and associated with putaminal atrophy. Discontinuity of HPR was more frequently observed in MSA-P. On visual analysis, the characteristics of HPR were similar between MSA-C patients and normal subjects. Patients with MSA of either type had significantly higher MD values of putamen than normal subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: HPR can be observed in 38.5% of normal subjects at 1.5 T.

Therapeutical strategies have focused on stem cell-mediated remyelination and immunomodulation functions, on cellular infiltration into the brain, and on new ways for immuno-modulation for the development of future therapies in MS. Encouraging findings from clinical trials with current and emerging disease-modifying therapy being developed was also a key theme at this edition. Positive results have been reported for rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab, alemtuzumab, teriflunomide, BG-12, and laquinimod, including a favorable safety profile. Since armamentarium for the treatment of MS is fast increasing, concerns exist about the risk of severe adverse events with their use. This aspect reinforces the importance of disease registries as a proactive tool for monitoring drug safety in the post-approval setting.","2012",,"Rev Neurol",,"other","Algorithms, FALSE, Biomedical Research, FALSE, Congresses as Topic, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Multiple Sclerosis, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

RBD occurs in approximately 0.5% of the general population, with a higher prevalence in older men. RBD is a frequent feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but is only rarely reported in Alzheimer's disease. RBD is also a risk factor for α-synuclein-related diseases, such as DLB, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy. Therefore, RBD has major implications for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and for understanding specific neurodegeneration patterns. Several markers of neurodegeneration have been identified in RBD, including cognitive impairments such as deficits in attention, executive functions, learning capacities, and visuospatial abilities. Approximately 50% of RBD patients present mild cognitive impairment.

The fact that certain AD biomarkers show an acceptable sensitivity and specificity to detect AD pathology has shifted the diagnostic paradigm towards a clinicobiological approach. Neuropathological analysis of AD-affected brains reveals extensive atrophy due to neuronal loss, and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, surrounded by a tract of neuroinflammation and loss of neurons. Recently, emerging evidence supports the concept that AD is also a disorder of metabolic degeneration. Taken together, the neurochemical changes in the brain from patients with AD indicate multiple disturbances and it seems likely that the changes are secondary to more fundamental changes into the brain. There is a physiological decline of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis with ageing and the possibility that the GH/ IGF-I axis is involved in cognitive deficits has been recognized for several years. The IGF-I is a potent neurotrophic as well neuroprotective factor found in the brain with a wide range of actions in both central and peripheral nervous system. IGF-I is a critical promoter of brain development and neuronal survival and plays a role in neuronal rescue during degenerative diseases. The investigations of GH releasing stimulation tests especially to GHRH in AD are equivocal and in some cases contradictory. When a cholinesterase inhibitor as rivastigmine, a drug for AD, is acutely administered the area under the curve of the GH response to GHRH doubled, showing that rivastigmine is a powerful drug to enhance GH release. Starting with a more accurate diagnosis not of the clinical syndrome, but of underlying molecular defects, that may eventually lead to a personalized, more effective treatment. Hence, the development of novel therapeutic approaches is urgently needed.","2012",,"Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets",," review","Aging, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Animals, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Human Growth Hormone, FALSE, agonists, Q000819, Humans, FALSE, Insulin-Like Growth Factor I, FALSE, agonists, Q000819, Molecular Targeted Therapy, TRUE, Nerve Growth Factors, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neuroendocrine Cells, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Neurons, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Nootropic Agents, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

This disorder is highly frequent in patients with synucleinopathies (60%-100% of patients) and rare in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders. The disorder is detected by interview plus video and sleep monitoring. Abnormal movements expose the patients and bed partners to a high risk of injury and sleep disruption. The disorder is usually alleviated with melatonin and clonazepam. Limb movements are mainly minor, jerky, fast, pseudohallucinatory, and repeated, with a limp wrist during apparently grasping movements, although body jerks and complex violent (fights) and nonviolent culturally acquired behaviors are also observed. Notably, parkinsonism disappears during RBD-associated complex behaviors in patients with Parkinson's disease and with multiple system atrophy, suggesting that the upper motor stream bypasses the basal ganglia during REM sleep. Longitudinal studies show that idiopathic RBD predisposes patients to later develop Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and, more rarely, multiple system atrophy, with a rate of conversion of 46% within 5 years. During this time window, patients concomitantly develop nonmotor signs (decreased olfaction and color vision, orthostatic hypotension, altered visuospatial abilities, increased harm avoidance) and have abnormal test results (decreased putamen dopamine uptake, slower EEG). Patients with idiopathic RBD have higher and faster risk for conversion to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies if abnormalities in dopamine transporter imaging, transcranial sonography, olfaction, and color vision are found at baseline.

The prevalence of OH is related to aging, reaching 5 to 30% in unselected elders aged more than or equal to 65 years, especially those treated for hypertension and/or living in nursing homes or health care facilities. OH is associated with an increased risk of syncope and subsequent cardiovascular mortality. Standing results in pooling of 25-30% of blood in the lower extremities and splanchnic-mesenteric circulation, thereby reducing venous return, ventricular filling, cardiac output and, in turn, blood pressure. Compensatory mechanisms to maintain BP involve the baroreflex and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Failure of SNS results in neurogenic OH, which is severe in multiple system atrophy with dysautonomia (Shy-Drager syndrome), also commonly seen in patients with Lewy body dementia and in patients with Parkinson's disease, in whom OH is less severe and occurs later. Conversely, SNS function is preserved in secondary OH associated with hypovolemia, anemia, antihypertensive or psychotropic drugs.

In vitro, CLR01 inhibited the assembly of α-syn into β-sheet-rich fibrils and caused disaggregation of pre-formed fibrils, as determined by thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopy. α-Syn toxicity was studied in cell cultures and was completely mitigated by CLR01 when α-syn was expressed endogenously or added exogenously. To determine if CLR01 was also protective in vivo, we used a novel zebrafish model of α-syn toxicity (α-syn-ZF), which expresses human, wild-type α-syn in neurons. α-Syn-ZF embryos developed severe deformities due to neuronal apoptosis and most of them died within 48 to 72 h. CLR01 added to the water significantly improved zebrafish phenotype and survival, suppressed α-syn aggregation in neurons, and reduced α-syn-induced apoptosis. α-Syn expression was found to inhibit the ubiquitin proteasome system in α-syn-ZF neurons, resulting in further accumulation of α-syn.

This observation provides evidence for a difference in phenotype distribution between British and Japanese patients with definite MSA.

Although potential drawbacks to the published frequencies of clinical subtypes and pathological subtypes should be considered because of selection biases, the difference demonstrated in pathological subtype is also consistent with the differences in clinical subtype of MSA demonstrated between Europe and Asia. Modest alterations in susceptibility factors may contribute to the difference in MSA phenotype distribution between populations.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: General community in Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults 65 years and older with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 or memory complaints were enrolled in this study. This study examined 34 participants with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 58 nonamnestic MCI (non-aMCI) participants.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following physical performance tests were conducted: muscle strength of knee extension, 1-legged standing time, 5-m walking test, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The z scores of the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease were determined to assess the degree of atrophy in the bilateral medial temporal areas including the entorhinal cortex (MTA-ERC).
RESULTS: In the aMCI group, 6MWT performance was associated with MTA-ERC atrophy (β=-.462, P=.014) after controlling for age. In the stepwise multiple regression analyses, 6MWT and body mass index were found to be significant determinants of MTA-ERC atrophy in all participants (R(2)=.275), as well as the aMCI and non-aMCI groups when analyzed separately (R(2)=.418 and R(2)=.216, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A decline in exercise capacity was found to be more closely associated with atrophy of the MTA-ERC compared with other aspects of physical functioning in older adults with MCI, especially the amnestic type.

SMN is involved in multiple pathways, including RNA metabolism and splicing as well as motoneuron development and function. Here we provide evidence for a major contribution of the Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway in SMA pathogenesis. Using an in vivo protein interaction system based on SUMOylation of proteins, we found that SMN is directly interacting with profilin2a. Profilin2a binds to a stretch of proline residues in SMN, which is heavily impaired by a novel SMN2 missense mutation (S230L) derived from a SMA patient.

Here we identified TPPP/p25 as an interacting partner of the soluble Aβ oligomers as major risk factors for Alzheimer disease using ProtoArray human protein microarray. The interactions of oligomeric Aβ with proteins involved in the etiology of neurological disorders were characterized by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, pelleting experiments, and tubulin polymerization assay. We showed that the Aβ(42) tightly bound to TPPP/p25 (K(d) = 85 nm) and caused aberrant protein aggregation by inhibiting the physiologically relevant TPPP/p25-derived microtubule assembly. The pair-wise interactions of Aβ(42), α-synuclein, and tubulin were found to be relatively weak; however, these three components formed soluble ternary complex exclusively in the absence of TPPP/p25. The aggregation-facilitating activity of TPPP/p25 and its interaction with Aβ was monitored by electron microscopy with purified proteins by pelleting experiments with cell-free extracts as well as by confocal microscopy with CHO cells expressing TPPP/p25 or amyloid. The finding that the interaction of TPPP/p25 with Aβ can produce pathological-like aggregates is tightly coupled with unusual pathology of the Alzheimer disease revealed previously; that is, partial co-localization of Aβ and TPPP/p25 in the case of diffuse Lewy body disease with Alzheimer disease.","2011",,"J Biol Chem",,"other","Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Animals, FALSE, CHO Cells, FALSE, Carrier Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cricetinae, FALSE, Cricetulus, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lewy Bodies, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Protein Array Analysis, FALSE, Protein Binding, FALSE, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Wistar, FALSE, Tubulin, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

To assess disease severity and progression, we constructed and validated a new clinical rating scale as an ancillary study.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patients were assessed at entry and 6-montly for up to 3 years. Evaluation of the scale's psychometric properties included reliability (n = 116), validity (n = 760), and responsiveness (n = 642). Among the 85 items of the initial scale, factor analysis revealed 83 items contributing to 15 clinically relevant dimensions, including Activity of daily Living/Mobility, Axial bradykinesia, Limb bradykinesia, Rigidity, Oculomotor, Cerebellar, Bulbar/Pseudo-bulbar, Mental, Orthostatic, Urinary, Limb dystonia, Axial dystonia, Pyramidal, Myoclonus and Tremor. All but the Pyramidal dimension demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach α ≥ 0.70). Inter-rater reliability was high for the total score (Intra-class coefficient = 0.94) and 9 dimensions (Intra-class coefficient = 0.80-0.93), and moderate (Intra-class coefficient = 0.54-0.77) for 6. Correlations of the total score with other clinical measures of severity were good (rho ≥ 0.70). The total score was significantly and linearly related to survival (p<0.0001). Responsiveness expressed as the Standardized Response Mean was high for the total score slope of change (SRM = 1.10), though higher in PSP (SRM = 1.25) than in MSA (SRM = 1.0), indicating a more rapid progression of PSP. The slope of change was constant with increasing disease severity demonstrating good linearity of the scale throughout disease stages. Although MSA and PSP differed quantitatively on the total score at entry and on rate of progression, the relative contribution of clinical dimensions to overall severity and progression was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: The NNIPPS-PPS has suitable validity, is reliable and sensitive, and therefore is appropriate for use in clinical studies with PSP or MSA.

Ablation of TLR4 in a transgenic mouse model of MSA with oligodendroglial α-synuclein overexpression augmented motor disability and enhanced loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. These changes were associated with increased brain levels of α-synuclein linked to disturbed TLR4-mediated microglial phagocytosis of α-synuclein. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor-α levels were increased in the midbrain and associated with a proinflammatory astroglial response.

We reviewed the records of 1318 patients diagnosed with PD or atypical parkinsonism at the Parkinson's Disease Center and Movement Disorders Clinic, Baylor College of Medicine. The frequency of symptomatic OH was 81% (21/26) in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 18% (198/1125) of PD patients, and 19% (31/167) of patients with non-MSA atypical parkinsonism.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional prospective study of intern patients at several Mexican elderly assistance institutions. We carried out a history and took blood pressure readings in a seated position, immediately after standing up, and again after 3 min of standing up.
RESULTS: We evaluated 132 patients, mean age 82.3 ± 9.5 years, 74.1% of them female. Thirty-nine (29.3%) subjects had OH. They had a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism, Parkinson's disease, depression and alcoholism. Their Minimental result was 15.45 ± 7.2 vs 16.12 ± 7.9 (p = 0.6) among those without OH, and their quality of life (Minnesota scale) was 12.1 ± 7.3 vs 9.15 ± 7.05 (p = 0.03).

Maternal and child data from studies in this community summarize the multiple predictors of FAS and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS).
METHOD: Sequential regression was employed to examine influences on child physical characteristics and dysmorphology from four categories of maternal traits: physical, demographic, childbearing, and drinking. Then, a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to predict influences on child physical characteristics.
RESULTS: Individual sequential regressions revealed that maternal drinking measures were the most powerful predictors of a child's physical anomalies (R² = .30, p < .001), followed by maternal demographics (R² = .24, p < .001), maternal physical characteristics (R²=.15, p < .001), and childbearing variables (R² = .06, p < .001). The SEM utilized both individual variables and the four composite categories of maternal traits to predict a set of child physical characteristics, including a total dysmorphology score. As predicted, drinking behavior is a relatively strong predictor of child physical characteristics (β = 0.61, p < .001), even when all other maternal risk variables are included; higher levels of drinking predict child physical anomalies.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the SEM model explains 62% of the variance in child physical anomalies. As expected, drinking variables explain the most variance.

Its pathogenesis may involve multiple genetic and nongenetic factors, but its etiology remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the genome of a patient with MSA would demonstrate copy number variations (CNVs) in the genes or genomic regions of interest. To identify genomic alterations increasing the risk for MSA, we examined a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for the MSA phenotype and 32 patients with MSA.
RESULTS: By whole-genome CNV analysis using a combination of CNV beadchip and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-based CNV microarrays followed by region-targeting, high-density, custom-made oligonucleotide tiling microarray analysis, we identified disease-specific copy number loss of the (Src homology 2 domain containing)-transforming protein 2 (SHC2) gene in the distal 350-kb subtelomeric region of 19p13.3 in the affected MZ twin and 10 of the 31 patients with MSA but not in 2 independent control populations (p = 1.04 × 10-8, odds ratio = 89.8, Pearson's chi-square test).
CONCLUSIONS: Copy number loss of SHC2 strongly indicates a causal link to MSA. CNV analysis of phenotypically discordant MZ twins is a powerful tool for identifying disease-predisposing loci.

,"21649449","The mechanism of action of interferon-β in relapsing multiple sclerosis.","Kieseier BC","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by autoimmune inflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration. It is believed that early in the disease course, proinflammatory T cells that are activated in the periphery by antigen presentation cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the CNS directed by various chemotaxic agents. However, to date, there has been no formal demonstration of a specific precipitating antigen. Once inside the CNS, activated T cells including T helper-1 (T(h)1), T(h)17, γδ and CD8+ types are believed to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Decreased levels of T(h)2 cells also correlate with relapses and disease progression in MS, since T(h)2-derived cytokines are predominantly anti-inflammatory. In healthy tissue, inflammatory effects are opposed by specific subsets of regulatory T cells (T(regs)) including CD4+, CD25+ and FoxP3+ cells that have the ability to downregulate the activity of proinflammatory T cells, allowing repair and recovery to generally follow inflammatory insult. Given their function, the pathogenesis of MS most likely involves deficits of T(reg) function, which allow autoimmune inflammation and resultant neurodegeneration to proceed relatively unchecked. Interferons (IFNs) are naturally occurring cytokines possessing a wide range of anti-inflammatory properties. Recombinant forms of IFNβ are widely used as first-line treatment in relapsing forms of MS. The mechanism of action of IFNβ is complex, involving effects at multiple levels of cellular function. IFNβ appears to directly increase expression and concentration of anti-inflammatory agents while downregulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. IFNβ treatment may reduce the trafficking of inflammatory cells across the BBB and increase nerve growth factor production, leading to a potential increase in neuronal survival and repair. IFNβ can also increase the number of CD56bright natural killer cells in the peripheral blood. These cells are efficient producers of anti-inflammatory mediators, and may have the ability to curb neuron inflammation. The mechanistic effects of IFNβ manifest clinically as reduced MRI lesion activity, reduced brain atrophy, increased time to reach clinically definite MS after the onset of neurological symptoms, decreased relapse rate and reduced risk of sustained disability progression. The mechanism of action of IFNβ in MS is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Ongoing and future studies will increase our understanding of the actions of IFNβ on the immune system and the CNS, which will in turn aid advances in the management of MS.","2011",,"CNS Drugs",," review","Humans, FALSE, Interferon-beta, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Treatment Outcome, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: A MEDLINE search using ""digit,"" ""finger,"" ""thumb,"" and ""replantation"" as keywords and limited to humans and English-language articles identified 1297 studies. Studies were included in the review if they (1) present primary data, (2) report five or more single or multiple distal replantations, and (3) present survival rates. Additional data extracted from the studies meeting the inclusion criteria included demographic information, nature and level of amputation, venous outflow technique, nerve repair, recovery of sensibility, range of motion, return to work, and complications.
RESULTS: Thirty studies representing 2273 distal replantations met the inclusion criteria. The mean survival rate was 86 percent. There was no difference in survival between zone I and zone II replantations (Tamai classification). There was a significant difference in survival between replantation of clean-cut versus the more crushed amputations (crush-cut and crush-avulsion). The repair of a vein improved survival in both zone I and zone II replantation. The mean two-point discrimination was 7 mm (n = 220), and 98 percent returned to work (n = 98). Complications included pulp atrophy in 14 percent of patients (n = 639) and nail deformity in 23 percent (n = 653).

The 32 item ordinal scale evaluated abnormalities within the basal ganglia and posterior fossa, blind to diagnosis. Among 760 patients in the study population (PSP = 362, MSA = 398), 627 had per protocol images (PSP = 297, MSA = 330). Intra-rater (n = 60) and inter-rater (n = 555) reliability were assessed through Cohen's statistic, and scale structure through principal component analysis (PCA) (n = 441). Internal consistency and reliability were checked. Discriminant and predictive validity of extracted factors and total scores were tested for disease severity as per clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were acceptable for 25 (78%) of the items scored (≥ 0.41). PCA revealed four meaningful clusters of covarying parameters (factor (F) F1: brainstem and cerebellum; F2: midbrain; F3: putamen; F4: other basal ganglia) with good to excellent internal consistency (Cronbach α 0.75-0.93) and moderate to excellent reliability (intraclass coefficient: F1: 0.92; F2: 0.79; F3: 0.71; F4: 0.49). The total score significantly discriminated for disease severity or diagnosis; factorial scores differentially discriminated for disease severity according to diagnosis (PSP: F1-F2; MSA: F2-F3). The total score was significantly related to survival in PSP (p<0.0007) or MSA (p<0.0005), indicating good predictive validity.
CONCLUSIONS: The scale is suitable for use in the context of multicentre studies and can reliably and consistently measure MRI abnormalities in PSP and MSA.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and associations of EDS in MSA.
DESIGN: Survey of EDS in consecutive patients with MSA and comparison with patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and individuals without known neurologic disease.
SETTING: Twelve tertiary referral centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six consecutive patients with MSA; 86 patients with PD matched for age, sex, and Hoehn and Yahr stage; and 86 healthy subject individuals matched for age and sex.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), modified ESS, Sudden Onset of Sleep Scale, Tandberg Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, disease severity, dopaminergic treatment amount, and presence of restless legs syndrome.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) ESS scores were comparable in MSA (7.72 [5.05]) and PD (8.23 [4.62]) but were higher than in healthy subjects (4.52 [2.98]) (P < .001). Excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score >10) was present in 28% of patients with MSA, 29% of patients with PD, and 2% of healthy subjects (P < .001). In MSA, in contrast to PD, the amount of dopaminergic treatment was not correlated with EDS. Disease severity was weakly correlated with EDS in MSA and PD. Restless legs syndrome occurred in 28% of patients with MSA, 14% of patients with PD, and 7% of healthy subjects (P < .001). Multiple regression analysis (with 95% confidence intervals obtained using nonparametric bootstrapping) showed that sleep-disordered breathing and sleep efficiency predicted EDS in MSA and amount of dopaminergic treatment and presence of restless legs syndrome in PD.

METHODS: We analyzed 911 patients who were referred from within our hospital. Data registries included a diagnosis, a lower urinary tract symptom questionnaire, a urodynamic study, and neurological examinations. Reduced bladder sensation is defined as bladder volume at the first sensation >300 ml. Increased bladder sensation is defined as bladder volume at the first sensation <100 ml. These patients were stratified into those with and without DO.
RESULTS: Neuropathies are the most common cause of reduced bladder sensation (33.3-43.8% in diabetic neuropathy, etc.). Myelopathies are the second most common cause (17.4-25.0% in multiple sclerosis, etc.). Less common is brain diseases (9.6% in multiple system atrophy, etc.). In contrast, myelopathies are the most common cause of increased bladder sensation without DO (25.0-40.0% in spinal forms of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, etc.). Neuropathies are the second most common (17.3-22.2% in post-pelvic organ surgery, diabetic neuropathy, etc.). Less common is brain/mental diseases (20.0% in psychogenic bladder dysfunction, 8.1% in Parkinson's disease, etc.).
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that neuropathies are the most common cause of reduced bladder sensation in neurologic/mental diseases. Increased bladder sensation without DO occurs mainly in peripheral and central sensory pathway lesions, as well as in basal ganglia lesions and psychogenic bladder dysfunction.

Unanswered is whether elimination of intrinsic instigators driving age-associated degeneration can reverse, as opposed to simply arrest, various afflictions of the aged. Such instigators include progressively damaged genomes. Telomerase-deficient mice have served as a model system to study the adverse cellular and organismal consequences of wide-spread endogenous DNA damage signalling activation in vivo. Telomere loss and uncapping provokes progressive tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure and impaired tissue injury responses. Here, we sought to determine whether entrenched multi-system degeneration in adult mice with severe telomere dysfunction can be halted or possibly reversed by reactivation of endogenous telomerase activity. To this end, we engineered a knock-in allele encoding a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase-oestrogen receptor (TERT-ER) under transcriptional control of the endogenous TERT promoter. Homozygous TERT-ER mice have short dysfunctional telomeres and sustain increased DNA damage signalling and classical degenerative phenotypes upon successive generational matings and advancing age. Telomerase reactivation in such late generation TERT-ER mice extends telomeres, reduces DNA damage signalling and associated cellular checkpoint responses, allows resumption of proliferation in quiescent cultures, and eliminates degenerative phenotypes across multiple organs including testes, spleens and intestines. Notably, somatic telomerase reactivation reversed neurodegeneration with restoration of proliferating Sox2(+) neural progenitors, Dcx(+) newborn neurons, and Olig2(+) oligodendrocyte populations. Consistent with the integral role of subventricular zone neural progenitors in generation and maintenance of olfactory bulb interneurons, this wave of telomerase-dependent neurogenesis resulted in alleviation of hyposmia and recovery of innate olfactory avoidance responses. Accumulating evidence implicating telomere damage as a driver of age-associated organ decline and disease risk and the marked reversal of systemic degenerative phenotypes in adult mice observed here support the development of regenerative strategies designed to restore telomere integrity.","2011",,"Nature"," Here , we sought to determine whether entrenched multi-system degeneration in adult mice with severe telomere dysfunction can be halted or possibly reversed by reactivation of endogenous telomerase activity ","other","Aging, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Animals, FALSE, Avoidance Learning, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Brain, FALSE, anatomy & histology, Q000033, Cell Differentiation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cells, Cultured, FALSE, DNA Damage, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Doublecortin Protein, FALSE, Enzyme Activation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Enzyme Reactivators, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Models, Animal, FALSE, Myelin Sheath, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neural Stem Cells, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Organ Size, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Phenotype, FALSE, Receptors, Estrogen, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Regenerative Medicine, FALSE, Smell, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Tamoxifen, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Telomerase, FALSE, deficiency, Q000172, Telomere, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The major causes are inadequate sun exposure and inadequate intakes of dietary and supplemental vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency defined as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than 20 and 21-29 ng/ml, respectively, have been linked to increased risk for a variety of medical conditions including cancer, heart disease, type II diabetes, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic bone diseases and neurological disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: The skeletal muscle and brain have a vitamin D receptor and the central nervous system has a capacity to activate vitamin D. Low vitamin D status has been linked to poor performance in neurocognitive testing in elderly. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with muscle weakness, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and a lower motor neuron-induced muscle atrophy.
SUMMARY: Correcting vitamin D deficiency and preventing vitamin D deficiency in children and adults should be a high priority for healthcare professionals to reduce risk for a wide variety of neurological disorders.

Because disease progression in MSA is rapid and no drug treatment consistently benefits MSA patients in the long term, neuroprotective or regenerative strategies may be invaluable in the management of MSA patients. In this study, we investigated whether human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) had a protective effect on MSA using an animal model of double-toxin-induced MSA parkinsonism (MSA-P). MSA-P was established with coinjections of MPTP and 3-NP; hMSCs were injected into the tail vein 1 day after the last toxin injection. Three groups of mice were compared (i.e., control, MPTP + 3-NP, and MPTP + 3-NP with hMSC treatment) through histopathological, behavioral, and Western blot analyses. In the substantia nigra (SN) and the striatum, 2.0% and 3.8% of total injected hMSCs were observed, respectively. Compared with double-toxin-treated mice, hMSC treatment in double-toxin-treated mice significantly increased survival of TH- and NeuN-immunoreactive cells in the SN and the striatum, with coincident improvement in motor behavior. Additionally, hMSC treatment significantly decreased double-toxin-induced microglial and astroglial activation in the SN and striatum. Western blot analysis showed that hMSC administration in double-toxin-treated mice increased the expression of p-Akt and Bcl-2 and decreased Bax and cytochrome c expression. This study demonstrates that hMSC treatment protected against loss of neurons in the SN and the striatum induced by double toxin exposure, which may be mediated by modulation of inflammatory and cell survival and death signaling-pathway as the hMSCs migrated from the peripheral circulation into the SN and striatum.","2011",,"Cell Transplant"," In this study , we investigated whether human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs ) had a protective effect on MSA using an animal model of double-toxin-induced MSA parkinsonism ( MSA-P ) ","other","Animals, FALSE, Corpus Striatum, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Cytochromes c, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, MPTP Poisoning, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation, TRUE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Motor Activity, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Neurotoxins, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Nitro Compounds, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Parkinsonian Disorders, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Propionates, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, bcl-2-Associated X Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

In patients with Parkinson's disease, ¹²³I-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (¹²³I-FP-CIT) SPECT detects striatal dopamine dysfunction resulting from nigral pathology whereas transcranial sonography (TCS) shows increased substantia nigra echogenic size, even before parkinsonism is clinically evident. We postulated that these neuroimaging changes could occur in a proportion of IRBD individuals who might then be at increased risk for development of a neurodegenerative disorder associated with substantia nigra dysfunction.
METHODS: In our prospective study, we identified patients with IRBD from individuals referred to our sleep disorders centre in Barcelona, Spain. At baseline, we assessed dopamine transporter [corrected] uptake by use of ¹²³I-FP-CIT SPECT, and estimated echogenicity of the substantia nigra by use of TCS. After a follow-up of 2·5 years, participants were clinically assessed to establish whether they had developed neurodegenerative syndromes. Data were compared with those of matched healthy controls.
FINDINGS: 43 individuals with IRBD agreed to participate in the study. We found reduced ¹²³I-FP-CIT binding in the striatum (p=0·045) in 17 (40%) of 43 participants compared with 18 controls, and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity in 14 (36%) of 39 participants with IRBD, compared with 16 (11%) of 149 controls (p=0·0002). Tracer uptake reduction was more pronounced in the putamen than it was in the caudate nucleus. 27 (63%) participants had reduced ¹²³I-FP-CIT binding or substantia nigra hyperechogenicity at baseline. Eight (30%) of these participants developed a neurodegenerative disorder (five Parkinson's disease, two dementia with Lewy bodies, and one multiple system atrophy). Individuals with normal neuroimaging results remained disease-free. Sensitivity of combined ¹²³I-FP-CIT SPECT and TCS to predict conversion to synucleinopathy after 2·5 years was 100% and specificity was 55%.
INTERPRETATION: In patients with IRBD, ¹²³I-FP-CIT SPECT and TCS can detect subclinical changes much the same as those typically seen in patients with early Parkinson's disease. Decreased striatal ¹²³I-FP-CIT binding and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity might be useful markers to identify individuals at increased risk for development of synucleinopathies.

It is the most frequent disorder among atypical parkinsonism with an estimated prevalence of 2 to 5 per 100 000 inhabitants. The clinical symptoms are rapidly progressing with a mean survival ranging between 6 to 9 years. The diagnosis is based on consensus criteria that have been revised in 2008. The diagnostic criteria allow defining ""possible"", ""probable"" and ""definite"" MSA. The latter requires post mortem confirmation of striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar degeneration with alpha-synuclein containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions. The diagnosis of ""possible"" and ""probable"" MSA is based on the variable presence and severity of parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic failure and pyramidal signs. According to the revised criteria, atrophy of putamen, pons, middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) or cerebellum on brain magnetic resonance imaging are considered to be additional features for the diagnosis of ""possible"" MSA. T2-weighted brain imaging may further reveal a putaminal hypointensity, a hyperintense lateral putaminal rim, the so called ""hot cross bun sign"" and MCP hyperintensities. Cardiovascular examination, urodynamic testing and anal sphincter electromyography may be helpful for the diagnosis of autonomic failure. Some patients may respond to levodopa, but usually to a lesser extent than those suffering from Parkinson's disease, and high doses are already required in early disease stages. No specific therapy is available for cerebellar dysfunction, while effective treatments exist for urinary and cardiovascular autonomic failure. Physical therapy may help to improve the difficulties of gait and stance, and to prevent their complications. In later disease stages, speech therapy becomes necessary for the treatment of dysarthria and dysphagia. Percutaneous gastrostomy is sometimes necessary in patients with severe dysphagia.

,"20674459","Respiratory problems in neurologic movement disorders.","Mehanna R","BACKGROUND: Movement disorders are a group of neurological motor disturbances manifested by either paucity or slowness of movement, such as seen in Parkinson's disease, or by abnormal involuntary movements, called hyperkinesias, which include tremor, dystonia, chorea, tics, myoclonus, and stereotypy. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the respiratory problems that are sometimes associated with these various movement disorders.
METHODS: References for this review were identified by searches of PubMed through June 2010, a text word search strategy. There were no language restrictions. Books on movement disorders, personal experience and judgment were also used in preparation of this review.
RESULTS: Data from 245 articles were critically reviewed, compared and integrated.
CONCLUSION: Although movement disorders are primarily considered motor disorders, the purpose of this review is to draw attention to their involvement of the respiratory system. It is critical that clinicians recognize the phenomenology and take appropriate action to prevent and treat the various respiratory problems associated with the various neurological disorders. Timely institution of therapeutic interventions is needed to favorably impact on the quality of life and survival of these patients.","2010",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord"," The aim of this review is to draw attention to the respiratory problems that are sometimes associated with these various movement disorders ","other","Antiparkinson Agents, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Dystonia, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Humans, FALSE, Huntington Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Hyperkinesis, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Movement Disorders, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Myoclonus, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Pneumonia, Aspiration, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Respiratory Tract Diseases, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Tics, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Tourette Syndrome, FALSE, complications, Q000150",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Even less is known about alterations of cortical projecting fiber tracts associated with basal forebrain atrophy. In this study, we determined regional atrophy within the basal forebrain in 21 patients with AD and 16 subjects with MCI compared to 20 healthy elderly subjects using deformation-based morphometry of MRI scans. We assessed effects of basal forebrain atrophy on fiber tracts derived from high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using tract-based spatial statistics. We localized significant effects relative to a map of cholinergic nuclei in MRI standard space as determined from a postmortem brain. Patients with AD and MCI subjects showed reduced volumes in basal forebrain areas corresponding to anterior medial and lateral, intermediate and posterior nuclei of the Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) as well as in the diagonal band of Broca nuclei (P < 0.01). Effects in MCI subjects were spatially more restricted than in AD, but occurred at similar locations. The volume of the right antero-lateral NbM nucleus was correlated with intracortical projecting fiber tract integrity such as the corpus callosum, cingulate, and the superior longitudinal, inferior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital, and uncinate fasciculus (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Our findings suggest that a multimodal MRI-DTI approach is supportive to determine atrophy of cholinergic nuclei and its effect on intracortical projecting fiber tracts in AD.","2011",,"Hum Brain Mapp",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Anisotropy, FALSE, Brain Mapping, FALSE, Cholinergic Agents, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prosencephalon, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

By using the Columbia University Division of Movement Disorders database, we reviewed data from 5,500 cases of parkinsonism and recorded the presence of upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction, lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction, or both. Among the 27 patients so identified, we counted those with autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar dysfunction, or dementia. Among the 27 cases, seven had UMN signs and LMN signs as well as parkinsonism and were diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-parkinsonism (Brait-Fahn disease). Three of the seven had dementia that was not deemed to be frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Six other patients had no LMN signs but had UMN signs and parkinsonism and were classified as having primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)-parkinsonism. Four patients had both UMN and LMN signs with parkinsonism as well as the characteristic dementia of FTD; they were diagnosed with FTD-parkinsonism-ALS. Seven patients had MND, parkinsonism, and autonomic or cerebellar dysfunction, a combination compatible with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Three patients had syndromes compatible with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). In sum, we found that MND occurs in association with diverse parkinsonian syndromes; some are heritable, others sporadic and causes are uncertain. Having MND may be a risk factor for parkinsonism.

The extent of AD when LV ejection fraction is preserved (HF-NEF), is unclear. Our objectives were: 1) quantitative assessment of autonomic function in SHF and HF-NEF; and 2) exploration of relationships among AD, symptoms and cardiac function.
METHODS: This was an observational study of patients newly referred from primary care with a heart failure diagnosis; 21 SHF, 20 HF-NEF patients and 21 normal subjects were recruited. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), Minnesota Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) and echocardiography. Autonomic assessment included haemodynamic responses to standing, deep breathing and handgrip. Concomitant blood pressure variability (BPV) and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were also derived.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in all haemodynamic responses between SHF, HF-NEF and normal. Log transformed (ln) low frequency spectral component of BPV was lower in SHF (4.1 ± 0.3) than HF-NEF (4.2 ± 0.4) and normal (4.4 ± 0.1; p=0.001 SHF vs HF-NEF and vs normal). Ln LF/HF was greater in normal than HF-NEF and SHF (1.5 ± 0.7 vs 0.9 ± 1.0 vs 0.6 ± 0.6; p=0.003). Autonomic modulations correlated negatively with severity of heart failure.

Presence or absence of tremulous arytenoid movements was recorded during wakefulness. The ratio of glottic stenosis (%), which represents the extent of airway narrowing under anesthesia, was obtained by measuring the inspiratory glottic angle during wakefulness and under anesthesia. The median ratio of glottic stenosis was significantly higher in patients with MSA (57.5%) than in control subjects (0.5%). Tremulous arytenoid movements were characterized by shaking movements of the arytenoid region including the vocal folds, which are most apparent in the arytenoid cartilage. In this study, tremulous arytenoid movements were observed in 18 (64.2%) of 28 patients with MSA, who displayed a significantly higher median ratio of glottic stenosis (71.2%) than other patients (34.9%).

GCIs or Papp-Lantos inclusions, described more than 20 years ago, are now accepted as the hallmarks for the definite neuropathological diagnosis of MSA and suggested to play a central role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. GCIs are composed of hyperphosphorylated alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn), ubiquitin, LRRK2 (leucin-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein) and many other proteins, suggesting that MSA represents an invariable synucleinopathy of non-neuronal type, a specific form of proteinopathies. The origin of alphaSyn deposition in GCIs is not yet fully understood, but recent findings of dysregulation in the metabolism of myelin basic protein (MBP) and p25alpha, a central nervous system-specific protein, also called TPPP (tubulin polymerization promoting protein), strengthened the working model of MSA as a primary glial disorder and may explain frequent alterations of myelin in MSA. However, it is unknown whether these changes represent an early event or myelin dysregulation occurs further downstream in MSA pathogenesis. The association between polymorphisms at the SNCA gene locus and the risk for developing MSA also points to a primary role of alphaSyn in its pathogenesis, while in a MBP promoter-driven alphaSyn transgenic mouse model gliosis accompanied the neurodegenerative process originating in oligodendrocytes. Because alphaSyn represents a major component in both oligodendroglial and neuronal inclusions in MSA, some authors suggested both a primary oligodendrogliopathy and a neuronal synucleinopathy, but current biomolecular data and animal models support a crucial role of the Papp-Lantos inclusions and of aberrant alphaSyn accumulation as their main constituent, causing oligodendroglial pathology, myelin disruption and, finally, neuronal degeneration in MSA. The relationship between oligodendrocytes involved by Papp-Lantos inclusions and those in degenerating neurons in the course of MSA needs further elucidation.","2010",,"Acta Neuropathol"," However , it is unknown whether these changes represent an early event or myelin dysregulation occurs further downstream in MSA pathogenesis "," review","Animals, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Inclusion Bodies, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Since the brainstem lesions that cause respiratory and autonomic dysfunction overlap with each other, these critical manifestations might get worse in parallel. If so, the detection of AF, which is comparatively easy, might be predictive of a latent life-threatening breathing disorder. In 15 patients with MSA, we performed autonomic function tests composed of postural challenges and administered a questionnaire on bladder condition, as well as polysomnography and laryngoscopy during wakefulness and under anesthesia. Polysomnographic variables such as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and the findings of laryngoscopy were compared with the degree of cardiac and urinary autonomic dysfunction. AHI, mean SpO(2) and the lowest SpO(2) showed significant correlations with urine storage dysfunction. In addition, patients with vocal cord abductor paralysis (VCAP) or central sleep apnea (CSA) contributing to nocturnal sudden death had more severe storage disorders than those without. On the other hand, no significant relationship between polysomnographic variables and orthostatic hypotension was observed except in the case of mean SpO(2). These results indicate that life-threatening breathing disorders have a close relationship with AF, and especially urine storage dysfunction.

However, the frequency of these syndromal 'dominant optic atrophy plus' variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established. In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers. Bilateral sensorineural deafness beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation, followed by a combination of ataxia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia from the third decade of life onwards. We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In contrast to initial reports, multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes, although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio = 3.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.44-6.49; P = 0.0027], and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region (odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-4.82; P = 0.0271).

However, the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant optic atrophy + group compared to the pure optic neuropathy group, implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology.

If we add other epigenetic factors to this, we can generate a very heterogeneous base, which explains why these diseases manifest through varied clinical and neuropathological phenotypes, distributed in <<complexes>> (groups of entities with symptomatic, neurochemical, histopathologic and proteinopathic affinities).
METHOD: A review of the current knowledge about phenotype variants of degenerative dementias has been carried out, detecting overlapping and divergent aspects between them and generating groups (complexes) which are more operative to work with, instead of using the current independent entities (diseases).
RESULTS: Besides the known Pick complex, there are sufficient data to propose the recognition of the Lewy complex, Alzheimer complex, multisystemic atrophy complex, and polyglutamine complex. Each one of them contains phenotypic variants that overlap with other complex variants, creating links between all the complexes and forming a spectrum in which almost all degenerative dementias can be included.
CONCLUSIONS: The progression of medical knowledge has made it more appropriate to locate each patient at a specific point in a complex, in the degenerative dementia spectrum, instead of diagnosing a generic disease. This change makes it recommendable to adjust the diagnostic criteria, and the therapeutic decisions should be designed individually according to their specific location in a complex.

,"19771175","Genetic variants of the alpha-synuclein gene SNCA are associated with multiple system atrophy.","Al-Chalabi A","BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autonomic dysfunction. Pathogenic mechanisms remain obscure but the neuropathological hallmark is the presence of alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive glial cytoplasmic inclusions. Genetic variants of the alpha-synuclein gene, SNCA, are thus strong candidates for genetic association with MSA. One follow-up to a genome-wide association of Parkinson's disease has identified association of a SNP in SNCA with MSA.
METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We evaluated 32 SNPs in the SNCA gene in a European population of 239 cases and 617 controls recruited as part of the Neuroprotection and Natural History in Parkinson Plus Syndromes (NNIPPS) study. We used 161 independently collected samples for replication. Two SNCA SNPs showed association with MSA: rs3822086 (P = 0.0044), and rs3775444 (P = 0.012), although only the first survived correction for multiple testing. In the MSA-C subgroup the association strengthened despite more than halving the number of cases: rs3822086 P = 0.0024, OR 2.153, (95% CI 1.3-3.6); rs3775444 P = 0.0017, OR 4.386 (95% CI 1.6-11.7). A 7-SNP haplotype incorporating three SNPs either side of rs3822086 strengthened the association with MSA-C further (best haplotype, P = 8.7 x 10(-4)). The association with rs3822086 was replicated in the independent samples (P = 0.035).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We report a genetic association between MSA and alpha-synuclein which has replicated in independent samples. The strongest association is with the cerebellar subtype of MSA.

However, there are only few reports on the prevalence of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction progressive in supranuclear palsy (PSP). Moreover, the relation of detailed cardiovascular testing and easy to assess 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) is not known. Our study evaluates 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring in patients with PD, PSP, MSA, and corresponding controls (Con) and relates the findings to the results of comprehensive cardiovascular autonomic testing. Twenty-three patients with PD, 25 patients with PSP, 25 patients with MSA, and 26 corresponding controls were studied by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in comparison to cardiovascular autonomic testing. Patients with PD, PSP, and MSA presented frequently with a pathological nocturnal BP regulation (no decrease or even an increase of nocturnal BP) in comparison to the control group (PD 48%, PSP 40%, MSA 68% vs. Con 8%). In MSA and PD patients, the frequent pathological BP increase during night was closely correlated to orthostatic hypotension. Since loss of nocturnal BP fall is frequent in patients with extrapyramidal syndromes, even if they are free of subjective autonomic dysfunction, we recommend 24-hour ABPM as an easy to perform screening test, especially if detailed autonomic testing is not available. Pathological loss of nocturnal BP fall may account for increased cardiovascular mortality in extrapyramidal syndromes.","2009",,"Mov Disord",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Autonomic Nervous System, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Basal Ganglia Diseases, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Blood Pressure, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory, FALSE, Circadian Rhythm, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Heart Rate, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Humans, FALSE, Hypertension, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Tilt-Table Test, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

To uncover the spectrum of neural damage associated with atopy, we conducted a cross-sectional nationwide survey of AM and atopy-related peripheral neuritis (APN), including Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), in individuals with atopic diathesis.
METHOD: Cases with AM diagnosed between 1996 and 2006 and cases with APN between 2000 and 2006 were collected from all over Japan. Detailed data on 109 patients with AM and 133 patients with APN were collated.
RESULTS: Patients with APN showed a preponderance of women, higher age at onset, and greater eosinophil counts than patients with AM. Patients with AM most commonly showed cervical cord involvement, whereas patients with APN preferentially exhibited mononeuritis multiplex predominantly affecting the lower limbs. Among patients with AM, motor weakness and muscle atrophy were significantly more frequent in those with bronchial asthma than in those with other atopic disorders. Patients with APN who met the criteria for CSS showed a higher age at onset, higher frequencies of systemic organ involvement, and greater disability than those who did not. Abnormalities suggesting peripheral nervous system involvement were seen in 25.7% of patients with AM, whereas 18.8% of patients with APN had abnormalities indicating CNS involvement. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that atopic dermatitis increased the risk of myelitis, whereas high age at onset and bronchial asthma decreased that risk.

Although various risk factors (eg, severity of illness, corticosteroids, neuromuscular blocking agents) have been implicated in critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM), the evidence supporting these associations is inconsistent. Hyperglycemia may be an important risk factor for CINM, with tight glycemic control through intensive insulin therapy reducing the incidence of CINM. Early mobility in the intensive care unit may minimize disuse atrophy and possibly CINM, through exercise training and its anti-inflammatory effects. Although emerging data have demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and benefit of early mobility in critically ill patients, randomized controlled trials are needed to thoroughly evaluate its potential benefits on patients' muscle strength, physical function, and quality of life.

It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movement and is exacerbated or occurs mainly in the evening or night. People suffering from RLS are estimated to represent 2-3% of the general Japanese population, which is relatively lower than the estimated prevalence in western countries. Supportive diagnostic critevia include family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. RLS phenotypes include an early onset form that is usually idiopathic with frequent familial history and a late onset form that is usually secondary to other somatic conditions that are causative factors in RLS occurrence. In all patients presenting with complaints of insomnia or discomfort in the lower limbs, diagnosis of RLS should be considered. RLS should be differentiated from akathisia, which is an urge to move the whole body in the absence of uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test (SIT) can detect PLM in patients that are asleep or awake. RLS may cause severe sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms, and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Secondary RLS may occur due to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drug use including antipsychotics and antidepressants. Small fiber neuropathy can trigger RLS or mimic its symptoms.

Embryonic stem cells, fetal mesencephalic neurons, and neural stem cells have been introduced as restorative strategies in PD animals and patients, but ethical and immunological problems as well as the serious side effects of tumorigenesis and disabling dyskinesia have limited clinical application of these stem cells. Meanwhile, cell therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is attractive clinically because these cells are free from ethical and immunological problems. MSCs are present in adult bone marrow and represent <0.01% of all nucleated bone marrow cells. MSCs are themselves capable of multipotency, differentiating under appropriate conditions into chondrocytes, skeletal myocytes, and neurons. According to recent studies, the neuroprotective effect of MSCs is mediated by their ability to produce various trophic factors that contribute to functional recovery, neuronal cell survival, and stimulation of endogenous regeneration and by immunoregulatory properties that not only inhibit nearly all cells participating in the immune response cell-cell-contact-dependent mechanism, but also release various soluble factors associated with immunosuppressive activity. However, the use of MSCs as neuroprotectives in PD and MSA has seldom been studied.

Using Drosophila oogenesis as a model system, we show that mutations in smn cause abnormal nuclear organization in nurse cells and oocytes. Germline and mitotic clonal analysis reveals that both nurse cells and oocytes require SMN to maintain normal organization of nuclear compartments including chromosomes, nucleoli, Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies. We previously found that SMN-containing U bodies invariably associate with P bodies (Liu, J. L., and Gall, J. G. (2007). U bodies are cytoplasmic structures that contain uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and associate with P bodies. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 11655-11659.). Multiple lines of evidence implicate SMN in the regulation of germline nuclear organization through the connection of U bodies and P bodies. Firstly, smn germline clones phenocopy mutations for two P body components, Cup and Ovarian tumour (Otu). Secondly, P body mutations disrupt SMN distribution and the organization of U bodies. Finally, mutations in smn disrupt the function and organization of U bodies and P bodies.

The depletion of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal intermediolateral cell column (IML) and its afferent medullary catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons has been proposed to be partly responsible for autonomic failure in MSA. In this study, we investigated whether the depletion of neurons in any of these autonomic neuron groups contributes to sudden death in MSA. Out of 52 autopsy-proven patients with MSA, we selected 12 individuals who had died within 3.5 years after disease onset to define the accurate levels of slices and identify early neuropathological changes of autonomic nuclei in MSA. Four patients succumbed to sudden death and eight patients died through established causes. Serial 10 mum sections were obtained from the 8th segment of the thoracic cord and the rostral medulla oblongata. Sections from the medulla oblongata were immunostained for thyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. The total cell number in the five sections was computed for comparison. Compared with the control, the MSA group showed a marked depletion of neurons in the IML (38.0 +/- 7.1 versus 75.2 +/- 7.6 cells, P < 0.001), thyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) (17.4 +/- 5.1 versus 72.8 +/- 13.6 cells, P < 0.01) and tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the VLM (15.6 +/- 9.2 versus 60.8 +/- 17.0 cells, P < 0.01), nucleus raphe obscurus (19.3 +/- 4.4 versus 75.3 +/- 8.6 cells, P < 0.001), nucleus raphe pallidus (2.1 +/- 2.7 versus 9.0 +/- 3.4 cells, P < 0.03), and arcuate nucleus (0.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.3 +/- 1.5 cells, P < 0.05). Moreover, in patients who succumbed to sudden death, when compared with patients who had established causes of death, we found a marked depletion of tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the VLM (7.3 +/- 3.5 versus 21.8 +/- 6.5 cells, P < 0.02) and nucleus raphe obscurus (15.0 +/- 2.0 versus 22.5 +/- 2.1 cells, P < 0.01). The results indicate that the spinal IML and medullary catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems are involved even in the early stages of MSA, and the dysfunction of the medullary serotonergic system regulating cardiovascular and respiratory systems could be responsible for sudden death in patients with MSA.","2009",,"Brain"," In this study , we investigated whether the depletion of neurons in any of these autonomic neuron groups contributes to sudden death in MSA ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Brain Mapping, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Catecholamines, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Death, Sudden, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Medulla Oblongata, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Phenotype, FALSE, Serotonin, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Spinal Cord, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: Participants aged 65 years and over in the cross-sectional population-based EUREYE study underwent an eye examination including digital retinal photography. The images were graded at a single centre. A structured questionnaire was administered by trained field workers for putative risk factors for AMD including history of diabetes mellitus. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between diabetes and stages of AMD, taking account of potential demographic, behavioural, dietary and medical (history of cardiovascular disease) confounders.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Photographic images were graded according to the modified International Classification System for AMD and stratified into five exclusive stages from no signs of AMD (AMD stage 0), early AMD (Stages 1-3) and late AMD (Stage 4). Late AMD was subdivided in neovascular AMD (NV-AMD) or geographic atrophy (GA).
RESULTS: Data on diabetes history and potential confounders were available in 2117 control subjects without AMD, 2182 with early AMD, 49 with GA and 101 with NV-AMD. Of all participants, 13.1% reported a history of diabetes. After adjusting for potential confounders, subjects with neovascular AMD compared with controls had increased odds for diabetes (odds ratio 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 2.98, p = 0.02). Subjects with AMD grades 1 to 3 or GA had no increased odds for diabetes compared with those without AMD.
CONCLUSIONS: In the EUREYE study, after multiple adjustments, positive association of diabetes mellitus with neovascular AMD was found. The hypothesis that diabetes is associated with neovascular AMD but not with geographic atrophy may suggest a different pathogenesis of the two advanced forms of the disease and needs to be further evaluated.","2009",,"Br J Ophthalmol"," OBJECTIVE : To examine the association between self-reported diabetes history and early or late age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) in the European population ","other","Aged, FALSE, Diabetic Retinopathy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Epidemiologic Methods, FALSE, Europe, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Life Style, FALSE, Macular Degeneration, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Male, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, this conclusion might have been reached because some patients with multiple system atrophy incorrectly diagnosed as Parkinson's disease were included in these reports. Therefore, we investigated the outcome of transurethral prostate resection in patients with a secure neurological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent transurethral prostate resection for benign prostatic obstruction were evaluated retrospectively. Subsequent neurological developments in patients were followed, ensuring that those with multiple system atrophy had not been included in analysis.
RESULTS: At transurethral prostate resection median patient age was 73 years, median duration of Parkinson's disease before the resection was 3 years, and median Hoehn and Yahr scale was 2. Of the 14 patients with a preoperative indwelling urinary catheter transurethral prostate resection restored voiding in 9 (64%) and only 5 (36%) required catheterization postoperatively. Of the 10 patients with preoperative urge urinary incontinence, continence was restored in 5 and improved in 3 following transurethral prostate resection. There were no cases of de novo urinary incontinence after transurethral prostate resection. At a median postoperative followup of 3 years transurethral prostate resection was successful in 16 of the 23 patients (70%).
CONCLUSIONS: Transurethral prostate resection for benign prostatic obstruction in patients with Parkinson's disease may be successful in up to 70% and the risk of de novo urinary incontinence seems minimal. Thus, Parkinson's disease should no longer be considered a contraindication for transurethral prostate resection provided that preoperative investigations including urodynamic assessment indicate prostatic bladder outlet obstruction.","2009",,"J Urol"," PURPOSE : According to the literature transurethral resection of the prostate in patients with Parkinson's disease has an increased risk of postoperative urinary incontinence ","other","Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Prostatic Hyperplasia, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Safety Management, FALSE, Transurethral Resection of Prostate, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Treatment Outcome, FALSE, Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Urinary Incontinence, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Urination Disorders, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The best studied of these is PD. alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) has a key role in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic PD, but evidence linking it to other predisposition factors is limited. Here we report a strong genetic interaction between alpha-syn and the yeast ortholog of the PD-linked gene ATP13A2 (also known as PARK9). Dopaminergic neuron loss caused by alpha-syn overexpression in animal and neuronal PD models is rescued by coexpression of PARK9. Further, knockdown of the ATP13A2 ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans enhances alpha-syn misfolding. These data provide a direct functional connection between alpha-syn and another PD susceptibility locus. Manganese exposure is an environmental risk factor linked to PD and PD-like syndromes. We discovered that yeast PARK9 helps to protect cells from manganese toxicity, revealing a connection between PD genetics (alpha-syn and PARK9) and an environmental risk factor (PARK9 and manganese).

To define the role of Abl in the regulation of adult T cells we ablated Abl exclusively in T cells by generating mice with floxed abl alleles and expressing an Lck-Cre transgene (Abl-T(-/-)). These mice exhibited thymic atrophy and abnormally reduced T cell numbers in the periphery. The thymic atrophy was caused by increased susceptibility of thymocytes to cell death. Importantly, Abl deficient T cells displayed abnormally reduced response to mitogenic stimulation in vitro.

Our aim was to develop new simple squatting test indices and to analyse their applicability to the assessment of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in patients with diabetes.
METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (mean age 23.2 +/- 3.8 years) and 51 patients with diabetes (mean age 55.9 +/- 10.6 years) were enrolled in study 1 and study 2, respectively. Each subject stood for 3 min (basal period), then squatted down for 1 min (Sq) and stood up again for 1 min (St). In study 1, the squatting test was performed before and after pharmacological autonomic blockade. In study 2, we measured HR in each period and calculated the difference between basal HR and HRSq (DeltaHRSq) and between HRSt and HRSq (DeltaHRSt). BRS was also measured using the phenylephrine method in diabetic patients.
RESULTS: In healthy individuals during autonomic blockade, HR changes were mainly controlled by the vagal tone during squatting and by the sympathetic tone during standing.

We analysed the accuracy of our clinical diagnostic criteria, and studied prognostic factors for survival. Patients with an akinetic-rigid syndrome diagnosed as having PSP or MSA according to modified consensus diagnostic criteria were considered for inclusion. The psychometric validity (convergent and predictive) of the NNIPPS diagnostic criteria were tested prospectively by clinical and pathological assessments. The study was powered to detect a 40% decrease in relative risk of death within PSP or MSA strata. Patients were randomized to riluzole or matched placebo daily and followed up to 36 months. The primary endpoint was survival. Secondary efficacy outcomes were rates of disease progression assessed by functional measures. A total of 767 patients were randomized and 760 qualified for the Intent to Treat (ITT) analysis, stratified at entry as PSP (362 patients) or MSA (398 patients). Median follow-up was 1095 days (range 249-1095). During the study, 342 patients died and 112 brains were examined for pathology. NNIPPS diagnostic criteria showed for both PSP and MSA excellent convergent validity with the investigators' assessment of diagnostic probability (point-biserial correlation: MSA r(pb) = 0.93, P < 0.0001; PSP, r(pb) = 0.95, P < 0.0001), and excellent predictive validity against histopathology [sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) for PSP 0.95 (0.88-0.98) and 0.84 (0.77-0.87); and for MSA 0.96 (0.88-0.99) and 0.91 (0.86-0.93)].

Since then, more than 300 patients have undergone this sort of treatment worldwide and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) published on two occasions, in 2002 and in 2006, the results of collective analyses performed in 85 and in 183 cases, respectively. In most communications the results were reported favorable with some cases showing spectacular recoveries and also probabilities of long-lasting disease stability, between 60 and 80% at three years after transplant. Of great interest was the fact that magnetic resonance imaging studies invariably showed that the inflammation in the central nervous system resolved and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were completely abolished or markedly reduced. These results appear superior to those yielded by standard therapies but this superiority needs to be demonstrated by comparative studies, such as the EBMT-launched ASTIMS trial. Moreover, ASCT is a rather toxic procedure associated with a mortality risk of 2-3%. Therefore, it is not a treatment for the general population of MS patients but only for selected cases that do not respond to standard therapies and worsen rapidly, i.e. in situations where benefits are expected to counterbalance morbidity and mortality risks. Nevertheless, certain issues seem to have cleared up: ASCT should be used early, during the inflammatory phase of the disease; very high-intensity pre-transplant conditioning regimens increase toxicity but do not seem to increase efficacy compared to intermediate-intensity regimens; the results are dramatic and life-saving in resistant, so-called ""malignant"" cases; ASCT does not only cause debulking of autoreactive clones but it also brings about qualitative immunological changes that might eventually establish immunologic self-tolerance; the progression of brain atrophy appears to slow down with time; with the implementation of proper patient-selection criteria, the risks of morbidity and mortality can be minimized.","2008",,"Autoimmunity",," review","Disease Progression, FALSE, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Humans, FALSE, Immunosuppressive Agents, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Multiple Sclerosis, FALSE, therapy, Q000628, Transplantation Conditioning, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The precise functions of alpha-synuclein remain elusive, but there are evidence indicating its involvement in regulation vesicular release and/or turnover and synaptic function in the central nervous system. It might play a role in neuronal plasticity responses, bind fatty acids, regulate certain enzymes, transporters, and neurotransmitter vesicles, be involved in neuronal survival and even can act as a molecular chaperone. Structurally, alpha-synuclein is an illustrative member of the rapidly growing family of natively unfolded (or intrinsically disordered) proteins and considerable knowledge has been accumulated about its structural properties and conformational behavior. The molecular mechanisms underlying misfolding, aggregation and fibrillation of alpha-synuclein and the role of various environmental and genetic factors in stimulation and inhibition of these processes are relatively well understood. Here, the main structural features of alpha-synuclein, its functions, and involvement in various human diseases are summarized providing a foundation for better understanding of the biochemistry, biophysics and neuropathology of alpha-synuclein aggregation.","2008",,"Curr Protein Pept Sci",," review","Amino Acid Sequence, FALSE, Amino Acid Substitution, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Models, Molecular, FALSE, Molecular Sequence Data, FALSE, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Point Mutation, FALSE, Protein Folding, TRUE, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Here we show that intrastriatal injection of colchicine (COL), a well-known microtubule disruptor, induced degeneration of striatonigral pathway. Microtubule disruption caused by unilateral injection of COL blocked the retrograde axonal transport of fluorogold previously injected into striatum and induced substantial death of striatal and DA neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Furthermore, COL-induced pathologic changes were associated with robust glial reaction, which may be conducive to the degeneration of striatonigral pathway. We also found that intrastriatal injection of COL resulted in side bias in spontaneous turning activities and apomorphine-induced rotational behavior. Together, our results provide in vivo data lending support to the concept that microtubule dysfunction may play a significant role in the death of DA neurons, though glial reaction may be involved and contribute to the degenerative process. Moreover, intrastriatal COL may serve as another experimental model of striatonigral degeneration (Parkinson's variant of multiple system atrophy), given the concurrent loss of both striatal and DA neurons.","2008",,"J Neurochem",,"comparative study","Animals, FALSE, Axons, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Survival, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Colchicine, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Corpus Striatum, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Male, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred C57BL, FALSE, Striatonigral Degeneration, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Orthostatic hypotension can result in considerable morbidity and even mortality and is a major management problem in disorders such as pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy and also in Parkinson's disease. Treatment is ideally two pronged, using non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures. Drug treatment ideally is aimed at restoring adequate amounts of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. This often is not achievable because of damage to sympathetic nerve terminals, to autonomic ganglia or to central autonomic networks. An alternative is the use of sympathomimetics (that mimic the effects of noradrenaline, but are not identical to noradrenaline), in addition to other agents that target physiological mechanisms that contribute to blood pressure control.L-threo-dihydroxyphenyslerine (Droxidopa) is a pro-drug which has a structure similar to noradrenaline, but with a carboxyl group. It has no pressor effects in this form. It can be administered orally, unlike noradrenaline, and after absorption is converted by the enzyme dopa decarboxylase into noradrenaline thus increasing levels of the neurotransmitter which is identical to endogenous noradrenaline. Experience in Caucasians and in Europe is limited mainly to patients with dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency. This review focuses on two studies performed in Europe, and provides information on its efficacy, tolerability and safety in patients with pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease.

Survival data and several clinically relevant milestones, namely: frequent falling, cognitive disability, unintelligible speech, severe dysphagia, dependence on wheelchair for mobility, the use of urinary catheters and placement in residential care were determined. On the basis of early symptoms, we subdivided cases with PSP into 'Richardson's syndrome' (RS) and 'PSP-parkinsonism' (PSP-P). Cases of MSA were subdivided according to the presence or absence of early autonomic failure. Sixty-nine (62.7%) of the 110 PSP cases were classified as RS and 29 (26.4%) as PSP-P. Of the 83 cases of MSA, 42 (53.2%) had autonomic failure within 2 years of disease onset. Patients with PSP had an older age of onset (P < 0.001), but similar disease duration to those with MSA. Patients with PSP reached their first clinical milestone earlier than patients with MSA (P < 0.001). Regular falls (P < 0.001), unintelligible speech (P = 0.04) and cognitive impairment (P = 0.03) also occurred earlier in PSP than in MSA. In PSP an RS phenotype, male gender, older age of onset and a short interval from disease onset to reaching the first clinical milestone were all independent predictors of shorter disease duration to death. Patients with RS also reached clinical milestones after a shorter interval from disease onset, compared to patients with PSP-P. In MSA early autonomic failure, female gender, older age of onset, a short interval from disease onset to reaching the first clinical milestone and not being admitted to residential care were independent factors predicting shorter disease duration until death.

CNS metastases have been managed with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and concomitant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Our previous study did not observe serious CNS toxicity (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1991;22:17-22). We now report on 5 patients who developed delayed significant CNS toxicity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed 5 patients with delayed CNS toxicity. The initial diagnosis was between 1981 and 2003. All patients had poor-risk disease according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Collaborative Group criteria. Of the 5 patients, 3 had CNS metastases at diagnosis and 2 developed relapses with CNS metastases. These 5 patients underwent WBRT to 4,000-5,000 cGy in 18-28 fractions concurrently with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
RESULTS: All 5 patients developed delayed symptoms consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The symptoms included seizures, hemiparesis, cranial neuropathy, headaches, blindness, dementia, and ataxia. The median time from WBRT to CNS symptoms was 72 months (range, 9-228). Head imaging revealed multiple abnormalities consistent with gliosis and diffuse cerebral atrophy. Of the 5 patients, 3 had progressive and 2 stable symptoms. Treatment with surgery and/or steroids had modest benefit. The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy resulted in significant debility in all 5 patients, resulting in death (3 patients), loss of work, steroid-induced morbidity, and recurrent hospitalizations.

METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-five PD patients, 133 MSA patients, and 77 normal control subjects were examined. Data concerning environmental factors were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: ORs for environmental risk factors for developing PD were 1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.10] for age and 2.37 (95% CI = 1.32-4.27) for rural well-water drinking for >10 years.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old female with a 2-year history of MSA was referred to physical therapy with a history of falls, increasing loss of balance and rapidly progressing lower body Parkinson's like dysfunction. Examination included range of motion, muscle strength, motor control, ambulation with and without assistive device, and determination of postural hypotension. Functional Reach (FR), Timed Up and Go (TUG), timed single limb stance (SLS), and the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) assessed safety, balance, and fall risk. Hypokinesia and festinating gait were observed during ambulation. Transfers sit to stand were functional, but with compromised safety. Impairments of muscle performance were found at ankle, knee, and hip. The patient wanted to be able to live at home to care for herself and disabled spouse. Low to moderate intensity, lower extremity resistance training was added (twice weekly) to an existing program of balance and flexibility exercises.
OUTCOMES: Clinically meaningful gains were achieved in all functional measures, and the patient performed SLS for 10 seconds when previously unable. More importantly, she achieved her goal of remaining at home with her spouse.
DISCUSSION: The addition of resistance training to an existing program of balance and flexibility exercises did not cause any adverse effects and appears to have led to improvements in balance and functional ability.","2008",,"J Geriatr Phys Ther"," PURPOSE : This case study documents the impact of a resistance-training program on a female patient with Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) ","other","Activities of Daily Living, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Postural Balance, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Resistance Training, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The involvement of neuroinflammation and microglial activation has been emphasized in the pathogenesis of PD. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that therapeutic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of developing PD. Here, we examined the effects of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen, meclofenamic acid sodium salt, sulindac sulfide, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac sodium salt, naproxen, and indomethacin, on the formation and destabilization of alphaS fibrils (falphaS) at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C in vitro, using fluorescence spectroscopy with thioflavin S and electron microscopy. All examined NSAIDs, except for naproxen and indomethacin, inhibited the formation of falphaS in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, these molecules dose-dependently destabilized preformed falphaS. The overall activity was in the order: ibuprofen approximately aspirin approximately acetaminophen approximately meclofenamic acid sodium salt approximately sulindac sulfide>ketoprofen approximately flurbiprofen approximately diclofenac sodium salt>naproxen approximately indomethacin. These findings indicate that NSAIDs could be key molecules for the development of therapeutic or preventive agents for LBD and MSA.","2008",,"Neuropharmacology",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, FALSE, In Vitro Techniques, FALSE, Microscopy, Electron, Scanning, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Neurofibrillary Tangles, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Reports have been accumulated showing an association of RBD and neurodegenerative diseases. However, in Japan, no data has been available about demographic features of RBD in a large patient population. We describe demographic characteristics of RBD patients presenting to our sleep center with special emphasis on association of RBD and neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: The subjects were consecutive 10,745 patients who presented with sleep and/or wake problems at our sleep center from April 1998 to March 2006. Diagnosis of RBD was made based on ICSD-2 criteria. Medical and sleep histories with complementary information from family members, and findings of neurological examination were assessed retrospectively from the notes of RBD patients.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (0.6%) were diagnosed as having RBD. There was strong male predominancy (85.1%). The onset of RBD symptoms was at 61.4+/-8.8 years of age. Neurological symptoms and signs were present in twelve (17.9 % of RBD patients) when they firstly came to our sleep center: 4 patients with Parkinson disease, 4 with multiple system atrophy and 1 with probable dementia with Lewy body. Thirteen patients (43.3%) were aware of olfactory impairment when inquired (out of 30 patients). Clonazepam was administered in 29 patients, and 21 (72.4%) responded well.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed the similar demographic characteristics of RBD to what was shown in the previous large case series. Although the association between RBD and neurodegenerative diseases was not so strong in our cases, it may be mainly because our sleep center was not run in the domain of neurology department and we could not vigorously detect the possible coexistence of neurodegenerative disease. The pathogenesis of RBD is still unclear; therefore, neurologists and sleep specialists need to collaborate in following up RBD patients to confirm whether they are at higher risk for developing a neurodegenerative disease.","2007",,"Brain Nerve",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lewy Body Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Retrospective Studies, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: Twenty-one patients without a definite neurologic diagnosis for recurrent sudden falls were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. SPECT with a DaT ligand was performed 180 min after injection of 185 MBq of (123)I-FP-CIT with a dual-head gamma-camera.
RESULTS: DaT SPECT findings were normal in 15 of 21 patients (71%). Of those, 73% had abnormal MRI findings suggestive of atherosclerotic lesions. Eleven patients with normal DaT SPECT findings had mild parkinsonian symptoms. There was no correlation of the SPECT results with patient age, duration of occurrence of falls, or frequency of falls, and there was no significant difference in the relative distributions of SPECT findings between patients with and patients without parkinsonian symptoms or vascular risk factors.

,"17998807","Rationale for the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors as a dual therapeutic modality in multiple sclerosis.","Gray SG","Major recent advances in the field of chromatin remodeling have dramatically changed our understanding of the ways in which genes are regulated. Epigenetic regulators such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are increasingly being implicated as direct or indirect components in the regulation of expression of neuronal, immune and other tissue specific genes. HDACs and HATs have been shown to play important roles in cell growth, cell cycle control, development, differentiation and survival. Mutations in genes that encode HDAC-binding proteins cause neurological disorders, such as MeCP2 mutations in Rett's syndrome. Mutations of CBP, a gene with HAT function, cause the mental retardation-associated Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Recently, HDAC inhibitors have been found to ameliorate progression of the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) motor neuron disease and the Huntington disease mouse models. The neuroprotective role of HDAC inhibitors seems to extend to other diseases that share mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation and neuronal cell apoptosis. HDAC inhibitors also have widespread modulatory effects on gene expression within the immune system and have been used successfully in the lupus and rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune disease models. Recently, we demonstrated the efficacy of the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A in ameliorating disease in the multiple sclerosis (MS) animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this review we describe the current literature surrounding these inhibitors and propose a rationale for harnessing both their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects to treat MS, an autoimmune, demyelinating and degenerative disease of the human central nervous system (CNS).","2006",,"Epigenetics",," review","Animals, FALSE, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Brain Ischemia, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Enzyme Inhibitors, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Epigenesis, Genetic, FALSE, Histone Acetyltransferases, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Models, Animal, FALSE, Multiple Sclerosis, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Neuroprotective Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Nucleosomes, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to Wy-14,643 (greater than 98% pure) in feed for up to 3 months; male B6C3F1 mice and male Syrian hamsters were exposed to Wy-14,643 in feed for 2 weeks or up to 3 months. Animals were evaluated for clinical pathology, plasma concentrations of Wy-14,643, reproductive system effects, cell proliferation and peroxisomal enzyme analyses, and histopathology. Single and multiple-dose toxicokinetic studies of Wy-14,643 were conducted in additional groups of male Sprague-Dawley and Wistar Furth rats, B6C3F1 mice, and Syrian hamsters. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in vivo in Tg.AC mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. In the 2-week studies, groups of five mice were fed diets containing 0, 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 ppm Wy-14,643 (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 2 to 184 mg Wy-14,643/kg body weight). Groups of five hamsters were fed diets containing 0, 10, 100, 500, 1,000, or 5,000 ppm Wy-14,643 (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 1 to 550 mg/kg). All animals survived to the end of the studies. The mean body weight gain of 500 ppm mice was significantly less than that of the controls; hamsters exposed to 100 ppm or greater lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 500 ppm mice was greater than that by the controls. Liver weights of all exposed groups of mice and hamsters were generally significantly increased. In the 2-week studies, an increase in peroxisomal enzyme activity occurred in 10 ppm mice; increases in peroxisomal $-oxidation, carnitine acetyltransferase, catalase, and acyl CoA oxidase occurred in all exposed mice compared to controls. Significantly increased BrdU-labeled hepatocyte percentages occurred in 100 and 1,000 ppm mice and 500 and 5,000 ppm hamsters; peroxisomal $-oxidation of lipids was increased in all exposed groups of mice and hamsters. Gross lesions in the 2-week studies included liver foci in one 500 ppm mouse and one 1,000 ppm hamster and enlarged livers in one hamster in each of the 100 and 500 ppm groups and two 5,000 ppm hamsters. All 500 and 1,000 ppm mice had hepatocyte hypertrophy of the liver, and 1,000 ppm mice also had widespread individual cell necrosis. Minimal to mild multifocal vacuolation of the liver occurred in hamsters exposed to 500 ppm or greater. In the 3-month core studies, groups of 10 male rats, mice, or hamsters were fed diets containing 0, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 500 ppm Wy-14,643 (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 0.3 to 34 mg/kg for rats, 0.9 to 135 mg/kg for mice, and 0.4 to 42 mg/kg for hamsters). Groups of 15 male rats, mice, or hamsters designated for special studies received the same concentrations of Wy-14,643 for up to 13 weeks. Groups of six male rats, 36 male mice, or 12 male hamsters designated for plasma concentration studies were fed diets containing 50, 100, or 500 ppm Wy-14,643 for up to 9 weeks. All core study animals survived to the end of the studies. Mean body weights were significantly decreased in all exposed groups except the 5 ppm groups and 10 ppm mice; hamsters in the 100 and 500 ppm groups lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by exposed rats and mice was generally similar to that by the controls; during week 14, hamsters exposed to 50 ppm or greater consumed slightly less feed than did the controls. The only clinical finding of toxicity was thinness of two 50 ppm and five 500 ppm hamsters. At all time points, the liver weights of exposed groups of core and special study rats, mice, and hamsters were generally significantly greater than those of the controls. Testis weights were significantly decreased in 500 ppm hamsters on day 34, in hamsters exposed to 5 ppm or greater at week 13 (special study), and in 100 and 500 ppm core study hamsters at the end of the study. In the sperm motility evaluation, the cauda epididymis weight of 500 ppm rats, epididymis weights of 100 and 500 ppm rats and mice, and the testis weight of 500 ppm mice were significantly less than those of the controls. For hamsters, cauda epididymis, epididymis, and testis weights; spermatid heads per testis; and spermatid counts were significantly decreased in all exposed groups evaluated for sperm motility. Epididymal spermatozoal motility and concentration in the 100 and 500 ppm groups and spermatid heads per gram testis in the 500 ppm group were also significantly decreased. Serum concentrations of estradiol were significantly decreased in all exposed groups of hamsters, and concentrations of testosterone and luteinizing hormone were decreased in groups exposed to 50 ppm or greater. At necropsy in the 3-month studies, liver foci were observed in three special study mice, including one 100 ppm mouse and one 500 ppm mouse on day 34 and one 100 ppm mouse at week 13. Liver discoloration and small testes were noted in 500 ppm hamsters on day 34, and hamsters exposed to 50 ppm or greater had enlarged livers and/or small testes at week 13 (special study) and at 3 months (core study). The incidences of cytoplasmic alteration in the liver were significantly increased in all exposed core groups of rats, mice, and hamsters; the severity of this lesion increased with increasing exposure concentration. The incidences of mitotic alteration of the liver in mice exposed to 50 ppm or greater and of liver pigmentation and oval cell hyperplasia in 500 ppm mice were significantly increased. Minimal regeneration of the corticomedullary junction of the renal tubule occurred in all exposed groups of rats. Significantly increased incidences of atrophy of the prostate gland, seminal vesicle, and testis occurred in 100 and 500 ppm hamsters. Degenerative myopathy of skeletal muscle was observed in the lumbar area and thigh of rats, mice, and hamsters and the lower leg of mice, primarily at 500 ppm. Following single-dose gavage exposure to Wy-14,643, plasma concentrations were generally higher in mice than in rats, which in turn were higher than those in hamsters. This pattern of plasma concentrations was usually attributed to high bioavailability in mice, medium bioavailability in rats, and low bioavailabilty in hamsters following an oral exposure to Wy-14,643.

We now know that there is frequent and extensive overlap, both clinically and pathologically, between Lewy body and Alzheimer diseases. Although some of this overlap may be attributable to common genetic and environmental risk factors, it is also now apparent that the 2 diseases share common neuroinflammatory mechanisms involving activation of microglia, overexpression of interleukin-1 and other inflammatory mediators, and inflammatory toxicity to neurons. Activated microglia are found in association with alpha-synuclein-containing neurons and glia in Parkinson disease, in dementia with Lewy bodies, and in multiple system atrophy, and these associations are reminiscent of microglial associations with neurofibrillary tangle-containing neurons in Alzheimer disease. In vitro and in vivo experimental work has shown reciprocal induction between alpha-synuclein and injured neurons on one hand and activated microglia and cytokine overexpression on the other.

PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease. Although the majority of PD cases are sporadic, 5-10% of PD is monogenic form of PD as familial PD (FPD). Multifactorial genetic-environmental interaction has been thought in PD pathogenesis, although these interactions are still poorly understood. In 2004, LRRK2 was identified as the causative gene for PARK8 originally mapped in the large Japanese Sagamihara family with late-onset autosomal dominant PD (ADPD). Patients with LRRK2 mutations account for approximately 2-13% of ADPD and 0.5-3% of sporadic PD. Genetically, LRRK2 mutations have been distributed worldwide with some ethnic differences by single founder effect such as G2019S, R1441G, and G2385R variants. LRRK2 G2385R was reported to be a risk factor for sporadic PD in Asia. Clinically, most patients with LRRK2 mutations develop typical idiopathic PD, however, variable clinical features and pathologies such as diffuse Lewy body disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been reported. Although Lewy bodies have been considered as a pathological hallmark for sporadic PD classically, some FPD and sporadic PD patients with heterozygous LRRK2 mutations or homozygous parkin mutations have no Lewy bodies. On the other hand, LRRK2 was reported as a component of Lewy bodies. Based on the variability, multifunction of LRRK2 such as phosphorylation of other proteins, especially, alpha-synuclein and tau, have been suggested. As interaction of Parkin and LRRK2 was reported, interaction and intersection among the autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant PD proteins could be involved in some common pathways, and LRRK2 may play an important role as a key FPD gene product. Identification of PARK8 and LRRK2 has given meaningful insights in not only PD but also numerous neurodegenerative disorders such as synucleinopathies and tauopathies with or without Lewy bodies.","2007",,"Brain Nerve",," review","Animals, FALSE, Diagnostic Imaging, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Polymorphism, Genetic, FALSE, Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Racial Groups, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Urogenital symptoms in MSA are usually due to a complex mixture of central and peripheral nervous abnormalities, sometimes superimposed on previous local pathological conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and perineal laxity. There have been instances were MSA-related urological symptoms were confused with symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, leading to unnecessary urological surgery. In this review, we present the phenotypic range and therapeutic approaches for common storage and voiding urological symptoms and ED, in patients with MSA.","2008",,"Neurourol Urodyn",," review","Erectile Dysfunction, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Phenotype, FALSE, Urinary Tract, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Urinary Tract Infections, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Urination Disorders, FALSE, etiology, Q000209",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Currently, no data suggests that patients with sporadic and familial RLS are at increased risk for developing a neurodegenerative disease. In particular, whether RLS is associated with Parkinson's disease has not been established. Only a few studies have directly addressed this issue, and these have methodological limitations yielding conflicting results. Few studies have assessed the frequency of RLS in other neurodegenerative disorders. In several autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, particularly in Machado-Joseph disease, a higher frequency of RLS is reported than could be accounted for in the general population. Two anecdotal publications have reported the presence of RLS in patients with Huntington's disease and hereditary spastic paraparesis.

METHODS: Records from patients visiting the Vanderbilt University Pediatric Ophthalmology Center during 2002 to 2005 were reviewed, and 98 patients were identified with an International Classification of Disease (9th ed.) coding of CVI (377.75). The charts were reviewed to assess presenting symptoms. The clinic and imaging notes were correlated with visual function (graded on a scale of I to VI).
RESULTS: The most common etiologies were perinatal hypoxia (35%), prematurity (29%), hydrocephalus (19%), structural central nervous system abnormalities (11%), and seizures (10%). Many children (69%) had multiple etiologies. Associated ophthalmic abnormalities included esotropia (19%), exotropia (40%), nystagmus (21%), and optic atrophy (42%). Significant refractive error (> +3.00 D or < -2.00 D) was common (20%). Associated neurological findings included seizures (60%), cerebral palsy (37%), periventricular leukomalacia (12%), hemiparesis (21%), and hearing loss (11%). Fifty-three percent of children initially diagnosed with CVI were followed for a period of 0.5 to 10 years. Forty percent of the patients showed no improvement in visual function; 34% had minimal improvement, and 17% had mild improvement. Only 6% of the patients had significant improvement in visual function. Eight patients had fixing and following or better acuity at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The major risk factors for CVI are perinatal hypoxia, premature birth, and hydrocephalus. Most patients have associated serious neurological and ophthalmologic abnormalities. While many patients have some recovery in vision acuity, most never see well. Patients with the most improvement in visual function were those having better initial acuity.","2007",,"J AAPOS"," PURPOSE : To evaluate the etiology , prognosis , and associated neurological and ophthalmologic findings of children with cortical visual impairment ( CVI ) at a tertiary care referral facility ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Blindness, Cortical, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Central Nervous System, FALSE, abnormalities, Q000002, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Hydrocephalus, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Hypoxia, Brain, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Infant, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Premature Birth, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Referral and Consultation, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Seizures, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Visually Impaired Persons, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: We addressed the objective through development of a structured critically appraised topic that included a clinical scenario, structured question, search strategy, critical appraisal, results, summary of best evidence, commentary, and bottom-line conclusions. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, clinical epidemiologists, medical librarians, and clinical content experts.
RESULTS: A retrospective study of 44 consecutive patients diagnosed with idiopathic RBD demonstrated that 20 patients (45%) developed a neurologic disorder, most commonly Parkinson disease or Lewy body dementia, after a mean of 11.5 years from reported symptom onset and 5.1 years after RBD diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Currently available evidence is limited to cross-sectional and retrospective analyses of patients with RBD. Although ascertainment biases and the retrospective nature of the available evidence limits quantitative analyses, the diagnosis of idiopathic RBD portends a risk of greater than 45% for future development of a clinically defined neurodegenerative disease.

Each new lesion often leaves a permanent MS plaque, which is composed of varying degrees of demyelination, axonal loss, and gliosis. New large lesions have a greater risk of evolving into permanent T1-weighted hypointense lesions (black holes) that pathologically contain the greatest axonal loss and correlate more strongly with clinical disability than with overall lesion load on T2-weighted images. There is also an association between the severity of the total T2 lesion burden with cerebral atrophy and with diffuse changes in the normal-appearing brain tissue as determined by magnetization transfer imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. To maintain normal clinical functioning, the brain may compensate by recruiting increased regions of cortex, as demonstrated by functional MRI (fMRI) studies. The degree of increased fMRI activation is proportional to the severity of T2 lesion load, up to a critical limit at which it appears that these compensatory mechanisms may fail. Therefore, new inflammatory activity, as detected by MRI, carries a risk of significant early pathologic damage and delayed yet permanent clinical disability.","2007",,"J Neurol Sci",," review","Atrophy, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Brain, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, standards, Q000592, Disease Progression, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Predictive Value of Tests, FALSE, Recovery of Function, FALSE, physiology, Q000502",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"
,"17346129","Orthostatic hypotension: evaluation and treatment.","Maule S","Orthostatic hypotension (OH) may be dependent upon various neurogenic and non-neurogenic disorders and conditions. Neurogenic causes include the main autonomic failure syndromes, primary (multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and autonomic failure associated with Parkinson's disease) and secondary (central nervous system diseases, peripheral neuropathies and systemic diseases). Non-neurogenic causes of OH include cardiac impairment, fluid and electrolyte loss, vasodilatation, and old age. A number of drugs may also cause OH, through their vasoactive action or by interfering with the autonomic nervous system. Symptoms of OH are debilitating, often confining patients to bed, and longitudinal studies have shown that OH increases the risk of stroke, myocardial ischemia and mortality. The therapeutic goal is to decrease the incidence and severity of postural symptoms, rather than restore normotension. In non-neurogenic OH, treatment of the underlying cause may be curative. In neurogenic OH a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures is often needed. Patient education and non-pharmacological measures represent the first step; among these interventions, fluid repletion and physical countermanoeuvres have been proven very effective. Pharmacological treatment comprises a number of agents acting on blood vessels, on blood volume or with other pressor mechanisms. The drugs most currently used are fludrocortisone and midodrine. Fludrocortisone expands the extravascular body fluid volume and improves alpha-adrenergic sensitivity. Midodrine is a peripheral, selective alpha1-adrenergic agonist that causes arterial and venous vasoconstriction. Despite the wide use of these drugs, multicentre, randomised and controlled studies for the treatment of OH are still scarce and limited to few agents and groups of patients. Pharmacological management of OH substantially improves the quality of life of patients, although it may be problematic.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of an unselected cohort of patients included throughout Aquitaine based on the Consensus Conference statement concerning MSA diagnostic criteria, with prospective follow-up on mortality. All patients received a standard clinical examination and disease history was collected through medical records and interviews of patients. Survival was ascertained by telephonic calls.
RESULTS: From 1 November 1998 to 1 April 2002, we diagnosed 86 patients (43 men and 43 women) with ""probable"" or ""possible"" MSA. Median survival from study inclusion was 2.4 years and was 10.2 years from clinical onset, very similar to the other series.

In these diseases increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest is established, while that in ALS remains uncertain.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied 12 pathologically confirmed sporadic ALS patients who received no assisted ventilation. Among them, two patients died of sudden cardiac arrest. Changes in QTc interval and dispersion, indices of sympathetic activities obtainable by routine electrocardiograms, were evaluated at the early stage and the terminal stage. Pathologically, intermediolateral nucleus (IML) sympathetic neurons in the upper thoracic cord were examined.
RESULTS: The QTc intervals and dispersion were significantly increased at the terminal stage compared with that at the early stage (p<0.01). The numbers of IML neurons were significantly lower in ALS patients than in controls (p=0.017), and had linear inverse correlation with the rate of increases in maximum QTc interval and QTc dispersion (p=0.01, r=-0.915 and p=0.02, r=-0.884). Notably, two patients with sudden cardiac arrest showed longer QTc interval, larger QTc dispersion, and lower number of IML neurons than most of others.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALS had reduced sympathetic activities at the terminal stage of disease, presumably due to neuronal loss in IML, which may increase risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Thus, prolonged QTc intervals and increased QTc dispersion may suggest an increased risk of sudden death in ALS, as in other neurodegenerative diseases.","2007",,"J Neurol Sci",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Death, Sudden, Cardiac, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Electrocardiography, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Heart, FALSE, innervation, Q000294, Humans, FALSE, Long QT Syndrome, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Neurons, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Spinal Cord, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Sympathetic Nervous System, FALSE, pathology, Q000473",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

DESIGN: A retrospective review of the medical records of 49 consecutive Japanese patients with pathologically confirmed MSA (29 men and 20 women; mean +/- SD age at onset, 59.8 +/- 6.5 years). Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risks of being in a wheelchair-bound state, being in a bedridden state, and having a shorter survival.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were diagnosed as having cerebellar type MSA, and 18 were diagnosed as having parkinsonian type MSA. Twenty-nine patients with cerebellar type MSA and 17 patients with parkinsonian type MSA had autonomic dysfunction. The median times from disease onset to being in a wheelchair-bound state, being in a bedridden state, death, and the development of autonomic dysfunction were 3.5, 5.0, 7.0, and 2.5 years, respectively. Patients with an early development of autonomic dysfunction (within 2.5 years from the onset of MSA) had significantly higher risks of being in a wheelchair-bound state (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 4.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04-9.15), being in a bedridden state (HR, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.77-8.48), having a shorter survival (HR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.61-7.15), and sudden death (HR, 7.22; 95% CI, 1.49-35.07).

Our studies reveal a modular composition of the SMN complex with the three proteins SMN, Gemin8, and Gemin7 in its center. Onto this central building block the other components are bound via multiple interactions. Furthermore, by employing a novel assay, we were able to reconstitute the SMN complex from individual components and confirm the interaction map. Interestingly, SMN protein carrying an SMA-causing mutation was severely impaired in formation of the SMN complex. Finally, we show that the peripheral component Gemin5 contributes an essential activity to the SMN complex, most likely the transfer of Sm proteins onto the U snRNA.

Age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 110) served as controls. At baseline, the SCD patients had a low BMD with high levels of serum ionized calcium and ICTP which correlated with the degree of immobilization (Barthel index). Over 10 years, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D decreased to the osteomalacic level (<5 ng/ml), and calcium and ICTP further increased in accordance with a decreased Barthel index score.

OPN is present in the rat SN, but its presence in human and non-human primate brain has not been extensively studied. Both OPN mRNA and protein were present in the normal marmoset SN, and OPN protein was localised to nigral neurones although these were not dopaminergic cells and it was not present in glial cells. In contrast, OPN protein was found in dopaminergic neurones in the normal human SN but again not in glial cells with some accumulation in the extracellular matrix. Following MPTP treatment of common marmosets, OPN protein expression was decreased, although its mRNA levels were unchanged and it was not present in either activated microglia or astrocytes. In the SN in PD, OPN protein expression was decreased in the remaining dopaminergic neurones and it was present in activated microglia but not in astrocytes. This was not specific to PD as OPN protein expression was also decreased in the SN in multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy with an identical localisation of the protein. The presence of OPN in the normal human and non-human primate SN coupled to its decreased expression following nigral cell degeneration suggests that it may play an important role in dopaminergic neurone survival.","2006",,"Brain Res",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Callithrix, FALSE, Cell Survival, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Dopamine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Down-Regulation, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Encephalitis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Female, FALSE, Gliosis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Neuroglia, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Osteopontin, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Oxidative Stress, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Parkinsonian Disorders, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, RNA, Messenger, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

AIM: To elucidate the clinical features and diagnosis of primary WD of the brain.
DESIGN: A single case study, with review of published data.
METHODS: We linked the information about our patient with 956 citations to published WD material. We were able to identify 19 other patients with primary WD of the brain.
RESULTS: Our patient was a 48-year-old woman who presented 2 years ago with generalized tonic/clonic seizures. WD of the brain was diagnosed after a life-threatening subacute deterioration leading to reduced consciousness and eye movement abnormalities. She had atrophy and gliosis of the right hippocampal formation, and nodular enhanc-ing lesions. She developed the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, blepharospasm with a complete paralysis of vertical gaze, a severe amnesic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea, altered sleep physiology and CSF oligoclonal bands. Primary WD of the brain was diagnosed after PCR confirmed Tropheryma whipplei DNA in CSF and blood. She recovered after intravenous methylprednisolone, meropenem and cotrimoxazole. She has now survived for 24 months, lives independently and drives. Comparing our patient with the 19 others, two clinical syndromes were apparent, in both adults and children: (i) multifarious neurological symptoms and signs with a CT or MRI showing multiple nodular enhancing lesions; (ii) focal neurology secondary to solitary mass lesions.

SMA is classified in three clinical types, SMA I, SMA II, and SMA III, based on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset. About 95% of SMA cases are caused by homozygous deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene (5q13), or its conversion to SMN2. The molecular diagnosis of this disease is usually carried out by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach able to evidence the absence of both SMN1 copies. However, this approach is not able to identify heterozygous healthy carriers, which show a very high frequency in general population (1:50). We used the multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) approach for the molecular diagnosis of SMA in 19 affected patient and in 57 individuals at risk to become healthy carriers. This analysis detected the absence of the homozygous SMN1 in all the investigated cases, and allowed to discriminate between SMN1 deletion and conversion to SMN2 on the basis of the size showed by the peaks specific for the different genes mapped within the SMA critical region. Moreover, MLPA analysis evidenced a condition of the absence of the heterozygous SMN1 in 33 out of the 57 relatives of the affected patients, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach in the identification of healthy carriers. Thus, the MLPA technique represents an easy, low cost, and high throughput system in the molecular diagnosis of SMA, both in affected patients and in healthy carriers.","2006",,"Neurogenetics",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, DNA Probes, FALSE, Gene Dosage, TRUE, Genotype, FALSE, Heterozygote, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Polymerase Chain Reaction, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length, TRUE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Spinal Muscular Atrophies of Childhood, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Recently, scientific interest has increased in defining factors that possibly contribute to brain functional plasticity; the results might be useful to assess the relationship between MS lesion burden and clinical events, as well as explaining the well-known phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease. In this study, we explored the effect of the Val66Met brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) functional polymorphism on cognitive performances and volumetric measurements obtained by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in a selected population of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, with relatively short disease duration and minimal clinical disability, compared to gender, age and educational-level matched healthy subjects. We found that in the RRMS group, the BDNF Met-allele was significantly associated with the lower volume of cerebral grey matter (GM) (P = 0.005). Furthermore, a significant (P = 0.013) interaction effect between 'MS-status' and the BDNF genotype was found for GM volumes, with the result that patients carrying the BDNF Met-allele showed a higher risk of developing global GM atrophy than the homozygous Val/Val. No BDNF-related impact on global neuropsychological functions resulted in either RRMS patients or controls. Our data seem to be consistent with the reported influence of BDNF in neuronal plasticity, thus suggesting that the Met-allele might have a negative prognostic effect on cortical morphometry in RRMS patients.","2007",,"Genes Brain Behav",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Atrophy, FALSE, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cerebral Cortex, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gene Frequency, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Matched-Pair Analysis, FALSE, Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Neurons, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Organ Size, FALSE, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Reference Values, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, the prevalence of FXTAS within other diagnostic categories is not well defined.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted of all published (n = 14) genetic screens for expanded FMR1 alleles to assess the prevalence and CGG-repeat size bias of FMR1 premutation alleles in those populations.
RESULTS: In men with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, the prevalence of premutation alleles (1.5%; 16/1049) was 13 times greater than expected based on its prevalence in the general population (2%; 16/818 for age of onset >50 years; odds ratio 12.4; 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 93.5). Meta-analysis of CGG-repeat data for screened patients with premutation alleles shows a shift to larger repeat size than in the general population (p<0.001). 86% (19/22) of premutation alleles were larger than 70 repeats in the patients screened, whereas only approximately 22% of premutation alleles are larger than 70 repeats in the general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Expanded FMR1 alleles contribute to cases of late-onset sporadic cerebellar ataxia, suggesting that FMR1 genetic testing should be carried out in such cases. The biased distribution of FMR1 allele sizes has substantial implications for genetic counselling of carriers with smaller alleles who are at a low risk of developing FXTAS, and suggests that the estimated prevalence of FXTAS among men >50 years of age in the general population may be two to threefold lower than the initial figure of 1 in 3000.","2006",,"J Med Genet",,"meta analysis","Adult, FALSE, Age of Onset, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alleles, TRUE, Ataxia, FALSE, Bias, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Fragile X Syndrome, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Genetic Testing, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Movement Disorders, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Parkinsonian Disorders, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Prevalence, FALSE, Spinocerebellar Degenerations, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Tremor, FALSE, Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The increased enterogastric reflux may provide the basis for increased mucosal injury. Bile reflux gastritis can appear in two circumstances: gastric resection with ablation of pylorus and primary biliary reflux due to the failure of pylorus. The aim of the study was to evaluate the endoscopical and histological changes caused by duodenal reflux on the gastric mucosa. The mucosal features were correlated with the risk factors involved in the development of bile reflux gastritis. Our study included 230 patients with alkaline reflux gastritis admitted in Medical Clinic no. 1, Emergency County Hospital Craiova. In all cases we performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Multiple biopsies were taken from gastric mucosa in 89 patients and the histological features were scored in accordance with the Sydney system. The average age of the patients with bile reflux gastritis was 58.387 years and the incidence of alkaline reflux gastritis was higher between 51 and 80 years. Reflux gastritis was noted to 138 males lpar;60%rpar; and 92 females (40%), ratio males/females was 1.5/1. The most frequent risk factors for bile reflux gastritis were gastric and biliary surgery. Alkaline reflux gastritis was observed in 167 cases (72.6%) after gastric surgery, consisting in gastric resection, pyloroplasty and gastroenteric-anastomosis. Gastroduodenal reflux after biliary surgery was noted in 17 cases (7.39%), 13 cases (5.69%) with cholecystectomy and four cases (1.73%) with biliary anastomosis. The average time interval from original operation to the discovery of the alkaline reflux gastritis was 14.91 years after gastric surgery and 15.29 years after biliary surgery. The commonest endoscopic alterations were: erythema of the gastric mucosa in 139 cases (64.43%), the presence of bile into the stomach in 133 cases (57.83%), the thicken of gastric folds in 22 cases (9.55%), erosions in 12 cases (5.22%), gastric atrophy in 12 cases (5.22%), petechiaes in five cases (2.17%), intestinal metaplasia one case (0.43%) and gastric polyp one case (0.43%). The histologic alterations observed from tissues collected during endoscopic examination were: chronic inflammation in 75 cases (84.06%), foveolar hyperplasia in 36 cases (40.44%), intestinal metaplasia in 31 cases (34.83%), acute inflammation in 16 cases (16.08%), Helicobacter pylori infection in 16 cases (16.08%), chronic atrophic gastritis in 12 cases (13.46%), gastric polyps in 12 cases (13.46%), dysplasia in 10 cases (11.23%), benign ulcerations in seven cases (3.04%), edema in six cases (6.74%) and neoplasia two cases (2.24%). Conclusions. Bile reflux gastritis was more frequent to male gender. The most frequent risk factors for alkaline reflux gastritis were gastric and biliary surgery. Reflux gastritis after gastric resection, pyloroplasty and gastroenteric-anastomosis were more frequent to male gender, while cholecystectomy and biliary anastomosis were predominantly to female gender. The average time interval from original operation to the discovery of the bile reflux gastritis was similar after gastric and biliary surgery. The commonest endoscopic alterations were: erythema of the gastric mucosa, the presence of bile into the stomach, thickens of gastric folds, erosions, gastric atrophy, petechiaes, intestinal metaplasia and gastric polyp.

,"16613748","Fractures of the femoral neck: a review and personal statement.","Raaymakers EL","EPIDEMIOLOGY: The number of hip fractures will increase enormously in the decades to come as will the cost of treatment of these patients do. In the USA the annual cost has estimated to be nearly $10 billion. Hip fractures, therefore, represent an enormous socio-economic and medical problem and challenge (orthopaedic) surgeons an anaesthetists to find the cheapest and most effective way to treat them. At the same time the search for preventive measures should be continued. Biphosphonates and hip protectors seem to be able to decrease the risk of suffering a hip fracture with 50%.
CLASSIFICATION: The first classification of femoral neck fractures, proposed by Abraham Colles, in displaced and non-displaced (impacted) fractures appears to be still the most useful one. The Pauwels classification cannot be applied to the preoperative x-ray, because the fractured leg is always in external rotation. The Garden classification is not reproducible and does not lead us to the right treatment.
TREATMENT: Stability and healing chances of impacted fractures depend especially on age and general condition. In patients under 70 years of age without co-morbidity, the secondary instability rate after non-operative treatment is very low: 5%. In elderly people with multiple co-morbidity secondary instability can go up to 80%. These patients are better served with primary operative treatment. Although the majority of surgeons feel good with a strategy of prophylactic internal fixation in all patients, this author pleads for non-operative (early mobilization) treatment of all patients, who are healthy or have only one serious comorbidity. There is consensus about the treatment of displaced fractures in patients under 65 years of age: closed reduction and internal fixation. The best treatment for patients over 80 years of age is prosthetic replacement. In the (large) group of patients between 65 and 80 years of age calendar age is not a reliable guide to the right treatment. There is a growing conviction that the choice between internal fixation and prosthetic replacement in these patients should be made on the basis of the biological age (ASA-score, habitat, the activity level, the need for walking aids and cognitive function). Bone density does not seem to play an important role. If internal fixation is the preferred treatment, the choice of implant is controversial. It is the author's experience that fractures with a steep fracture line (Pauwels 3) should be anatomically reduced and stabilized with a sliding hip screw. The less steep fractures (Pauwels 1 and 2) can be slightly over-reduced in valgus and anteversion, which provides a bony support against shearing forces, and fixed with parallel screws according to the 3-point-fixation principle. The timing of surgery continues to be a controversial subject. From a recent study in our own institution we concluded that no significant association could be found between delay to surgery and the clinical outcomes.However, considering the trends towards less complications and shorter length of hospital stay, early surgery (within 1 day from admission) is likely to be beneficial for hip fracture patients who are able to undergo operation. There is agreement about the use of the cemented arthroplasty. If a hemiarthroplasty is chosen, the bipolar type is to be preferred to the unipolar type. The difference in price between both prostheses is negligible because the overall cost of the treatment have gone up so immensely. Furthermore, a basic advantage of the bipolar system is the relatively small operation, needed for conversion to a total hip replacement, because the stem can stay in place. As to the question hemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement, the discussion has not yet been closed. We studied the natural history of the cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty by evaluating 307 patients, operated between 1975 and 1989 in our institution. Only 3 patients, who not have been revised, were alive at the end of the observation period (2004). A striking difference was found in the occurrence of late mechanical complications (aseptic loosening and acetabular wear) between patients under 75 years of age (22%) and the older group of patients (6%). As to the patient's overall satisfaction 56% suffered no impairment from their sustained fracture, 36% were slightly impaired. We concluded that the use of the cemented bipolar prosthesis is justified in patients over 75 years of age. Patients between 65 and 75 years of age should either be treated with internal fixation or with a total hip replacement. NONUNION OF THE FEMORAL NECK: Nowadays in cases of nonunions of the femoral neck the surgeon is tempted to perform prosthetic replacement of the hip, the more so if there is also evidence of a disturbed vascularisation of the head. This will provide rapid pain relief and mobilization. However, long-term results of hip arthroplasties, especially in younger people and in presence of bone atrophy, are not always as expected and a less radical approach is worth considering. The intertrochanteric valgization osteotomy, described by Pauwels is an excellent alternative for patients up to 65 years of age with a non-union of the femoral neck. A union rate of 80-90% is described by most authors. Leg length, rotational and angular deformities can be corrected at the same time. Between 65 and 80 years a total hip replacement is probably the best option for fit patients. For elderly patients a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty is an adequate treatment.","2006",,"Acta Chir Orthop Traumatol Cech"," We studied the natural history of the cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty by evaluating 307 patients , operated between 1975 and 1989 in our institution "," review","Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, FALSE, Femoral Neck Fractures, FALSE, surgery, Q000601, Fracture Fixation, Internal, FALSE, Fractures, Ununited, FALSE, surgery, Q000601, Humans, FALSE, Osteotomy, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

RESULTS: Falls were recorded in 606 (77.5%) and fractures in 134 (17.1%). In PD, female gender, symmetrical onset, postural instability, and autonomic instability all independently predicted time to first fall. In PD, PSP, and MSA latency to first fall was shortest in those with older age of onset of disease. Median latency from disease onset to first fall was shortest in Richardson's syndrome (12 months), MSA (42), and PSP-parkinsonism (47), and longest in PD (108). In all patients fractures of the hip were more than twice as common as wrist and forearm fractures. Fractures of the skull, ribs, and vertebrae occurred more frequently in PSP than in other diseases.
CONCLUSION: Measures to prevent the morbidity associated with falls and fractures in bradykinetic rigid syndromes may be best directed at patients with the risk factors identified in this study.","2006",,"J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry",,"other","Accidental Falls, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Adult, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cognition Disorders, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Fractures, Bone, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Humans, FALSE, Hypokinesia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

We investigated whether or not gluten sensitivity is involved in Japanese patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with extracerebellar presentation.
PATIENTS OR MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with extracerebellar presentation (autonomic instability, parkinsonism, or pyramidal dysfunction in varying combinations) were screened for anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) to analyze for the presence or absence of gluten sensitivity. Patients with typical MR findings of multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type were excluded. As disease controls without cerebellar ataxia, 9 patients with Parkinson's disease and 18 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were screened for AGA. Forty-seven normal controls were also screened for AGA.
RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of AGA in 5 (36%) of 14 cerebellar ataxia patients, but in only 1 (4%) of 27 disease controls without cerebellar ataxia (odds ratio, 14.4; 95% CI, 1.41147; p<0.05) and in only 1 (2%) of 47 normal controls (odds ratio, 25.6; 95% CI, 2.66246; p<0.001). Among the cerebellar ataxia patients, atypical features such as sensorimotor neuropathy and/or mild cognitive impairment were more prevalent in the AGA-positive group (60%) than in the AGA-negative group (0%).

So far our group has created a number of animal models of striatonigral degeneration, the core pathology underlying progressive Parkinsonism associated with multiple system atrophy, as testbed for neurorestaurative and neuroprotective approaches. Using embryonic allografts of either nigral, striatal, or combined nigro-striatal tissue we were able to consistently show graft survival in a denervated and lesioned striatum as well as improvement of rotational behaviour. However, due to severe lesions of the striatum and the chosen time window of 3-6 weeks between lesion and grafting, severe gliosis led to demarcation of the graft and prevented re-innervation of the remaining adult striatum. The aim of the present study was to modify our ""double toxin-double lesion"" rat model by reducing the dose of quinolinic acid injected into the striatum from 150 to 75 nmol and shortening the interval between lesion and grafting to 1-2 weeks. Injection of 75 nmol quinolinic acid still led to a significant reduction of DARPP-32 positive neurons and volume in the striatum. Analysis of embryonic mesencephalic grafts revealed survival of dopaminergic neurons and outgrowth of fibres re-innervating the adult striatum. Rotation behaviour was improved in the graft group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients suspected to have MSA between 1995 and March 2005 were identified from the Movement Disorders database and the autonomic function testing results. The medical records were reviewed using a standardised data collection form. The diagnosis of MSA was verified using the consensus statement. Disease progression was evaluated using 2 pre-determined events: aid-requiring walking and wheelchair use.
RESULTS: Seventy-two per cent (33/46) fulfilled the consensus statement. There were 85% Chinese, 9% Malays, and 6% Indians. The mean age at onset of the disease was 60 +/- 10 years. We found a predominance of males (M:F = 1.5:1) as well as MSA-C cases (67%). The most common initial presenting features were parkinsonism and cerebellar signs (27% each). Abnormal neuroimaging was seen in 29 patients (91%). Autonomic function testing was abnormal in 58% (7/12). The risk for aid-requiring walking and wheelchair use at 3 years from onset of the disease was 31% and 17%, respectively. By 5 years, this had increased to 45% and 30%, respectively. There was no difference in the events rate between MSA subtypes.

In India the prevalence of Parkinson's disease varied markedly from one study to another. The prevalence rate is high among the urban Parsi community of Mumbai. Incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease increase with increasing age. Some risk factors for Parkinson's disease have been narrated briefly.

METHOD: The vertical distribution of the abnormal neurons (neurons with enlarged or atrophic perikarya), surviving neurons, glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NI) were studied in alpha-synuclein-stained material of frontal and temporal cortex in ten cases of MSA.
RESULTS: Abnormal neurons exhibited two common patterns of distribution, viz., density was either maximal in the upper cortex or a bimodal distribution was present with a density peak in the upper and lower cortex. The NI were either located in the lower cortex or were more uniformly distributed down the cortical profile. The distribution of the GCI varied considerably between gyri and cases. The density of the glial cell nuclei was maximal in the lower cortex in the majority of gyri. In a number of gyri, there was a positive correlation between the vertical densities of the abnormal neurons, the total number of surviving neurons, and the glial cell nuclei. The vertical densities of the GCI were not correlated with those of the surviving neurons or glial cells but the GCI and NI were positively correlated in a small number of gyri.

The recent generation of transgenic mouse models of oligodendroglial alpha-synucleinopathy has enabled studies to investigate how alphaSYN causally contributes to MSA neuropathology. Moreover, human disease-specific pathological modifications of alphaSYN were recapitulated in transgenic mice, including insolubility, phosphorylation at serine-129, and ubiquitination. Thus, the transgenic mice will be useful tools to assess cellular risk factors, such as protein folding stress, protein kinase hyperactivity, and failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Moreover, transgenic mice expressing a hyperactive alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor mutant showed evidence of alphaSYN pathology in oligodendrocytes, adding dysregulated adrenergic neurotransmission to the list of potential risk factors of MSA. Finally, a double-transgenic mouse model expressing both alphaSYN and tau revealed synergistic fibrillization of these two proteins, providing an animal model for the not uncommon neuropathological finding of concomitant alpha-synucleinopathy and tauopathy within oligodendrocytes. Despite the progress made modeling MSA neuropathology in the transgenic mouse models, the molecular mechanism of how alphaSYN aggregation in oligodendrocytes causes neurodegeneration remains to be established.

RESULTS: Across the three groups studied, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there were no differences in the quality of RBD symptoms (e.g., nature of unpleasant dream recall or behaviors witnessed by bed partners), most PSG variables, abnormal behaviors captured by VPSG, and clinical response to clonazepam. When compared to subjects with PD, however, patients with MSA had a significantly shorter duration of disease, a higher REM sleep without atonia percentage, a greater periodic leg movement index, and less total sleep time.

In this study, we sought to determine whether cell loss or selective neuronal damage was the basis for the peripheral neuropathy caused by oxaliplatin. Adult female rats were given 1.85 mg/kg oxaliplatin twice per week for 8 weeks. Nerve conduction and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were studied 1 week after the completion of all treatment. No mortality occurred during oxaliplatin treatment, but the rate of body weight gain was reduced compared to age-matched vehicle-treated controls. Oxaliplatin slowed conduction velocity and delayed conduction times in peripheral sensory nerves, without affecting central or motor nerve conduction. In L5 DRG, total numbers of neurons were unchanged by oxaliplatin, but there were significant reductions in neuronal size distribution, ganglion volume, average cell size and the relative frequency of large cells. In addition, the relative frequency of small DRG cells was increased by oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin significantly altered the size distribution and average cell body area of the predominantly large parvalbumin-immunoreactive DRG neurons without affecting the frequency of parvalbumin staining. On the contrary, neither the staining frequency nor the size distribution of the predominantly small substance P-immunoreactive DRG neurons was changed by oxaliplatin. In conclusion, oxaliplatin causes selective atrophy of a subpopulation of DRG neurons with predominantly large parvalbumin-expressing cells without inducing neuronal loss. Because DRG cell body size and axonal conduction velocity are positively correlated, neuronal atrophy may be the morphological basis for the development of decreased sensory nerve conduction velocity that characterizes oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy.","2005",,"Cancer Chemother Pharmacol"," In this study , we sought to determine whether cell loss or selective neuronal damage was the basis for the peripheral neuropathy caused by oxaliplatin ","other","Animals, FALSE, Antineoplastic Agents, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Female, FALSE, Ganglia, Spinal, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Neural Conduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Organoplatinum Compounds, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Oxaliplatin, FALSE, Parvalbumins, FALSE, isolation & purification, Q000302, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Wistar, FALSE, Substance P, FALSE, isolation & purification, Q000302",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The lesions that occur in multiple organ/tissues will be discussed, dividing them into those that affect (a) the parenchyma or epithelia, (b) the stromal elements, and (c) the blood vessels. Since not all lesions fit into these patterns, the exceptions will be described as characteristic organ lesions. Unless specified otherwise the alterations presented are those that result from electromagnetic radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) as used for clinical radiation therapy. Most of the material presented will be delayed injury (i.e. months-to-years after exposure). The epithelial/parenchymal lesions include atrophy, necrosis, metaplasia, cellular atypia, dysplasia, and neoplasia. The common stromal lesions--the best recognized by pathologists--include fibrosis, fibrinous exudates, necrosis (with a paucity of cellular inflammatory exudates), and atypical fibroblasts. The vascular lesions are quite consistent: most often they affect the microvessels (capillaries, sinusoids) producing lethal and sublethal damage to the endothelial cells, with capillary rupture or thrombosis. Medium-size vessels show neointimal proliferation, fibrinoid necrosis, thrombosis, or acute arteritis. Damage in large vessels is less common; it occurs more in arteries than in veins and includes neointimal proliferation, atheromatosis, thrombosis and rupture (a dramatic complication). Some of the characteristic organ lesions are veno-occlusive liver disease, acute radiation pneumonitis, permanent bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia, and colitis cystica profunda. Neoplasms are a well-recognized delayed complication of radiation and will not be described in detail. It is important to remember that there are no pathognomonic features of injuries produced by ionizing radiation.

Systemic administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an irreversible succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, not only induces a cellular ATP depletions but also causes a selective striatal degeneration similar to that seen in HD. Recent accumulating reports have shown that ginseng saponins (GTS), the major active ingredients of Panax ginseng, have protective effects against neurotoxin insults. In the present study, we examined in vitro and in vivo effects of GTS on striatal neurotoxicity induced by repeated treatment of 3-NP in rats. Here, we report that systemic administration of GTS produced significant protections against systemic 3-NP- and intrastriatal malonate-induced lesions in rat striatum with dose-dependent manner. GTS also improved significantly 3-NP-caused behavioral impairment and extended survival. However, GTS itself had no effect on 3-NP-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase activity. To explain the mechanisms underlying in vivo protective effects of GTS against 3-NP-induced striatal degeneration, we examined in vitro effect of GTS against 3-NP-caused cytotoxicity using cultured rat striatal neurons. We found that GTS inhibited 3-NP-induced intracellular Ca(2+) elevations. GTS restored 3-NP-caused mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction in cultured rat striatal neurons. GTS also prevented 3-NP-induced striatal neuronal cell deaths with dose-dependent manner. The EC(50) was 12.6 +/- 0. 7microg/ml. These results suggest that in vivo protective effects of GTS against 3-NP-induced rat striatal degeneration might be achieved via in vitro inhibition of 3-NP-induced intracellular Ca(2+) elevations and cytotoxicity of striatal neurons.","2005",,"Neuropharmacology",,"comparative study","Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Calcium, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cell Count, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Cell Death, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Corpus Striatum, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, FALSE, Drug Interactions, FALSE, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Immunohistochemistry, FALSE, methods, Q000379, In Situ Nick-End Labeling, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Male, FALSE, NADP, FALSE, Panax, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Pentanoic Acids, FALSE, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Saponins, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Striatonigral Degeneration, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Succinate Dehydrogenase, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Tetrazolium Salts, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

However, it is not certain whether LS may cause urinary retention in elderly women.
METHODS: In a period covering the past 3 years, we retrospectively reviewed: a) urodynamic case records of women with urinary retention (post-void residuals, PVR > 100 ml), b) the records of women with LUTD due to LS (cauda equina syndrome and spinal canal narrowing by MRI), and c) uro-neurological features of women who belonged to both a) and b).
RESULTS: a) One-hundred women with a mean age of 58 years had urinary retention. The most common underlying disease was multiple system atrophy [19], followed by multiple sclerosis [13] and cervical/thoracic tumours [8]. LS was the fourth most common [5], with the highest age (71 years) of all diseases. b) Nineteen women with LUTD had LS (12, canal narrowing of 50-70%; 7 > 70 %), with a mean PVR volume of 60 ml. A fourth [5] of them had urinary retention, with severe spinal canal narrowing (all 5 > 70%). c) Thus, 5 women belonged to both a) and b). In 4 of these women, LUTD followed or occurred together with typical cauda equina syndrome symptoms such as sciatica and saddle anesthesia. However, one elderly woman presented with painless urinary retention, and absent ankle reflexes were the sole neurological abnormality. The urodynamic abnormalities underlying urinary retention included an underactive detrusor in all 5, bladder sensory impairment in 3, an unrelaxing sphincter in 2, a low compliance detrusor in one, neurogenic sphincter motor unit potentials in 2 of 4 studied, and cholinergic supersensitivity of the detrusor in one of 3 studied. Surgical decompression ameliorated urinary retention in 1 of 2 women who had surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, only 5 percent of the women with urinary retention had LS, but LS poses a potential risk for retention, particularly in elderly women with severe spinal canal narrowing. Preganglionic somato-autonomic dysfunctions underlie this condition. It may appear as the sole initial complaint in cases in which no other obvious neurological abnormalities are found.","2005",,"J Neurol"," OBJECTIVES : Lumbar spondylosis ( LS ) is a common spinal degenerative disorder which causes various types of lower urinary tract dysfunction ( LUTD ) ","comparative study","Aged, FALSE, Electromyography, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lumbosacral Region, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Membrane Proteins, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Spondylolysis, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Tumor Suppressor Proteins, FALSE, Urinary Retention, FALSE, etiology, Q000209",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

CASE REPORT: We describe a case displaying clinical symptoms that included respiratory failure, dysmorphias, hypotonia, deep tendon areflexia and respiratory complications, like the cases described in the literature. In the genetic study it was not possible to find the motor neuron gene surviving from the infantile muscular atrophy. The neuropathological disorders found in the necropsy study were olivopontocerebellar hypoplasia with intense neuronal loss (fundamentally from Purkinje cells and from the granular layer of the cerebellum, olivary nuclei and pons), replacement gliosis and degeneration of the motor cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Death occurred due to a respiratory complication in the 11th postnatal month.
CONCLUSIONS: The paper describes the clinical-pathological study and the genetic study of a female patient who died at the age of 11 months after being diagnosed as presumably suffering from Werdnig-Hoffman disease. The autopsy revealed an olivopontocerebellar hypoplasia, which is a morphological trait that is not associated with the above-mentioned entity. The microscopic study revealed extensive areas of gliosis and neuronal loss.

DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional, population-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: All visually impaired individuals from 0 to 17 years of age who were born at full term from 1972 through 1989 in Finland and recorded in the Finnish Register of Visual Impairment (n = 556) were eligible for this study.
METHODS: Data in the Finnish Register of Visual Impairment relating to 556 subjects were supplemented with data from hospital records and other national registers (Register of Births, Register of Congenital Malformations, Finnish Care Register, and Finnish Cancer Register). Data relating to the children born at full term were compared with Finnish perinatal and vital statistics and with data concerning children born prematurely. The chi-square test (Mantel-Haenszel) and stepwise logistic regression analysis were used in statistical analysis of the data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, time of onset of visual impairment, ophthalmic diagnosis of visual impairment, systemic disease, multiple handicap, 5-minute Apgar score, prenatal disorders, perinatal disorders, disorders arising during infancy and childhood, and treatment.
RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-one of the 556 individuals with visual impairment (78%) had been born at full term. Visual impairment was predominantly associated with genetic (53%) and prenatal (34%) factors. Ocular malformations (34%), retinal diseases (31%), and neuro-ophthalmologic disorders (26%) were the main ophthalmic diagnoses.

PD, one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia or akinesia, and postural instability. The disease is characterized pathologically by distinctive neuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies in many surviving cells of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and other specific brain regions. Furthermore Lewy body type degeneration in the cardiac plexus has been observed in PD. In PD, cardiac MIBG uptake is reduced markedly even in the early disease stages; therefore, MIBG imaging can be used as an indicator of the presence of PD rather than disease severity. Other parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration demonstrate normal cardiac MIBG uptake or only mild reduction of MIBG uptake, indicating that MIBG imaging is a powerful method to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian syndromes. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) also shows severe reduction of MIBG uptake, whereas Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrates normal MIBG uptake, permitting differentiation of DLB from AD using MIBG scintigraphy. In pure autonomic failure, which shares similar pathological findings with PD and is thought to be associated with diffuse loss of sympathetic terminal innervation, cardiac MIBG uptake also decreases markedly. Considering all the data together, marked reduction of cardiac MIBG uptake seems to be a specific marker of Lewy body disease and thus extremely useful in the differentiation from other diseases with similar symptoms without Lewy bodies.","2004",,"Ann Nucl Med",," review","3-Iodobenzylguanidine, TRUE, Animals, FALSE, Autonomic Nervous System, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Clinical Trials as Topic, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lewy Body Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Radionuclide Imaging, FALSE, Radiopharmaceuticals, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: A total of 285 patients with pathologically proven neurodegenerative disorders, including diffuse and transitional Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and multiple system atrophy, with a mean age of 75.1 +/- 9.3 years, were suitable for genetic and pathological analysis. Disorders were grouped as tauopathies (progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration), synucleinopathies (Lewy body disease and multiple system atrophy), and frontotemporal degeneration. Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging and quantitative scores of senile plaques were used to determine the degree of concomitant Alzheimer-type pathologic features in each case, and apolipoprotein E genotype was determined from DNA isolated from frozen brain tissue. The relationship of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 to Alzheimer-type pathologic features was determined.
RESULTS: Across all neurodegenerative disorders, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 and older age independently predicted the co-occurrence of Alzheimer-type pathologic features (P<.001), whereas female sex had a lesser effect (P = .03). When divided into the 3 subgroups (tauopathies, synucleinopathies, and frontotemporal degeneration), apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 had a similar effect, whereas older age and female sex were less predictive. There was a significant difference between the frequency of Alzheimer-type pathologic features in synucleinopathies and the frequency of such features in tauopathies and frontotemporal degeneration (P<.001 for both).

CONCLUSIONS: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4, independent of older age and sex, contributes to the co-occurrence of Alzheimer-type pathologic features in tauopathies, synucleinopathies, and frontotemporal degeneration, but this does not explain why Alzheimer-type pathologic features are significantly more likely to coexist with synucleinopathies than with either tauopathies or frontotemporal degeneration.","2004",,"Arch Neurol"," OBJECTIVES : To determine if apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 influences the frequency of Alzheimer-type pathologic features in tauopathies , synucleinopathies , and frontotemporal degeneration and to determine if the frequency of Alzheimer-type pathologic features in synucleinopathies is similar to the frequency of such features in tauopathies and frontotemporal degeneration ","comparative study","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Apolipoprotein E4, FALSE, Apolipoproteins E, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Dementia, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Female, FALSE, Genetic Markers, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Neurofibrillary Tangles, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Odds Ratio, FALSE, Plaque, Amyloid, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Sex Factors, FALSE, Synucleins, FALSE, Tauopathies, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, tau Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The following variables were investigated: family history of neurodegenerative diseases, education, smoking habits, hobbies, and occupational history. Occupational history of farming was significantly more frequent among MSA cases than controls (OR adj = 2.52; 95% CI, 1.25 to 5.07, MSA vs. hospital controls; OR adj = 4.53; 95% CI, 1.68 to12.2, MSA cases vs. population controls). A dose-response analysis for years of farming corroborated this association. We recently found that smoking is significantly less frequent among MSA cases than controls (Vanacore et al.

Since autonomic disturbances affect patient survival, an understanding and recognition of these disturbances are important. We adopted several new methods to evaluate autonomic function accurately. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy can assess the cardiac autonomic function even in the presence of cardiac arrhythmia. Laser-Doppler flowmetry, ultrasonographic study in the vessels and near-infrared spectrophotoscopy techniques serve as useful markers for screening the dysfunction of vasomotor neurons and blood circulation. Electrogastrography and the circadian rhythms of protein C secretion could be markers of the visceromotor nerves in the abdomen. Electrogastrography is a particularly useful tool for reflecting on functional changes in gastrointestinal motility. The evaluation of anemia could be a marker of autonomic dysfunction in the kidney and bone marrow in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, pandysautonomia, and multiple system atrophy. Normocytic and normochromic anemia correlated with the severity of autonomic dysfunction were shown in these patients. We also evaluated the dysfunction of the neuroendocrine system and sudomotor neuron using our new autonomic function tests. The glucose-tolerance test could become one of the most useful clinical tools for detecting autonomic dysfunction in the endocrine system. Microhydrography and thermography could be useful tools for diagnosing the lesion site of dyshidrosis. Moreover, it is clinically important to check the systemic circulation and autonomic function in patients treated with sildenafil citrate and organ transplantation to save their lives.

The rationale for such an approach in autoimmune diseases is based on the concept of lymphoablation of self-reactive lymphocytes followed by de novo immune system reconstitution, which, in the presence of the autoantigens in the thymus, may reinduce self-tolerance. Our previous work shows that in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), autologous/syngeneic BMT not only prevents the appearance of paralytic signs, but can also partially reverse chronic disease and induce long-term, antigen-specific tolerance. However, there are serious reservations to be considered when interpreting these data and before applying similar protocols in patients with multiple sclerosis. (1) The model of EAE is not a completely reliable model of multiple sclerosis. (2) In animals with chronic EAE, although further relapses were prevented, the established paralysis was usually not reversible. According to recent data, in chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, damage caused by axonal loss/transection and cortical/spinal cord atrophy is irreversible and probably amenable to immunotherapy. (3) Long-term, antigen-specific tolerance may be induced with BMT, but not in all cases; in passively induced CR-EAE, many of the mice relapsed upon challenge with myelin antigens, which may indicate that the presence of the immunizing, myelin antigens (on the site of immunization) during the process of immune reconstitution is critical for induction of tolerance. Finally, one should weigh the procedure-related risks (including mortality of up to 5%) of bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation (SCT).

This article describes a fourth approach that is based on nuclear scanning to visualize cardiac sympathetic innervation and function and relationships between the neuroimaging findings and those from other approaches. Multiple-system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension (formerly the Shy-Drager syndrome) features normal cardiac sympathetic innervation and normal entry of norepinephrine into the coronary sinus (cardiac norepinephrine spillover), in contrast to Parkinson disease with orthostatic hypotension, which features neuroimaging and neurochemical evidence for loss of cardiac sympathetic nerves. This difference may have important implications not only for diagnosis but also for understanding the etiology of Parkinson disease. By analysis of curves relating myocardial radioactivity with time (time-activity curves) after injection of a sympathoneural imaging agent, it is possible to obtain information about cardiac sympathetic function. Abnormal time-activity curves are seen in common disorders such as heart failure and diabetic neuropathy and provide an independent, adverse prognostic index.

Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a moderate but significant correlation between brain or spinal cord atrophy and physical disability in patients with MS. Longitudinal studies (>/= 5 years) have shown that CNS atrophy is a significant predictor of subsequent long-term neurologic deterioration. The clinical relevance of CNS atrophy is reinforced by studies showing that atrophy accounts for more variance than conventional lesion measures in predicting disability. Impaired quality of life and both urodynamic and sexual dysfunction, but not fatigue, are associated with brain atrophy. It is likely that once the level of CNS atrophy reaches a critical threshold, patients begin to suffer clinical impairment and disease progression. Longitudinal studies suggest that CNS atrophy may occur in patients with clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes who are at high risk for developing clinically definite MS. Longitudinal natural history studies in relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS have suggested that patients develop CNS atrophy at a faster rate in the first few years of disease than later in the disease course. Similarly, long-term follow-up studies have shown a poor relationship between disease duration and the rate of brain atrophy.

Animal models are helpful for elucidating these different aspects. First, this paper describes a new model of shaken baby syndrome (SBS) in mice, without impact or hypoxia. Mortality was 27%; 75% of survivors had focal brain lesions consisting of haemorrhagic or cystic lesions of the white matter, corpus callosum and cerebellum. All shaken animals, with and without focal lesions, showed delayed white matter atrophy. White matter damage and atrophy were reduced by pre-treatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist, indicating that excess glutamate release contributed to the pathophysiology of the lesions. Secondly, it discusses data on neuroprotection after early brain injuries; drugs targeting the NMDA receptors cannot be used in clinical practice but indirect neuroprotection strategies including anti-NO, anti-free radicals and trophic factors hold promise for limiting the excitotoxic white matter damage induced by early injury, in particular caused by shaking, during brain development.

There is a growing appreciation that, far from being a disease with purely psychological manifestations, major depression is a systemic disease with deleterious effects on multiple organ systems. Stressful life events have a substantial causal association with depression, and there is now compelling evidence that even early life stress constitutes a major risk factor for the subsequent development of depression. The emerging evidence suggests that the combination of genetics, early life stress, and ongoing stress may ultimately determine individual responsiveness to stress and the vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, such as depression. It is likely that genetic factors and life stress contribute not only to neurochemical alterations, but also to the impairments of cellular plasticity and resilience observed in depression. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that signaling pathways involved in regulating cell plasticity and resilience are long-term targets for the actions of antidepressant agents. Agents capable of reversing the hypothesized impairments of cellular resilience, reductions in brain volume, and cell death or atrophy in depression have the potential of becoming new therapeutic classes of antidepressant drugs. Novel cellular targets include agents targeting neurotrophic pathways, glucocorticoid signaling, phosphodiesterase activity, and glutamatergic throughput. The future development of treatments that more directly target molecules in critical CNS (central nervous system) signaling pathways that regulate cellular plasticity thus hold promise as novel, improved long-term treatments for major depression.","2004",,"Sci STKE",," review","Animals, FALSE, Depression, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Genes, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Humans, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Signal Transduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Stress, Psychological, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Because the extent of presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation can be quantified in PD even at an early or preclinical stage of the disease, PET imaging may allow the selection of at-risk subjects for neuroprotective intervention trials. These techniques may also provide markers to follow progression of disease or evaluate the effects of neurorestorative interventions in patients who have more advanced disease. PET is expected to play an increasing role in the selection of patients who have PD for deep brain stimulation. Dopaminergic studies may have a limited clinical role in the diagnosis of patients who have symptoms that suggestive of PD yet do not respond to typical dopaminergic drugs, such as patients who have vascular parkinsonism or ET with mild resting tremor who may have normal dopaminergic innervation. The differential diagnosis between PD and multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or corticobasal degeneration is not yet clearly established by PET, but combined pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic imaging may be able to distinguish early idiopathic PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders, in general. Huntington's chorea is characterized by more prominent striatal dopamine receptor loss, whereas nigrostriatal denervation is present to a lesser degree. Patients who have TS may have enhanced synaptic dopamine release in the putamen. Functional imaging studies have generally failed to demonstrate nigrostriatal denervation in essential tremor or idiopathic dystonia. Studies have shown striatal dopamine receptor loss in selected subtypes of dystonic patients. In conclusion, it is expected that PET will help us to better understand the pathophysiology of movement disorders, increase the diagnostic accuracy, allow preclinical diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic agents.

We have been investigating the role of restraint stress in Theiler's virus infection in mice as a model for multiple sclerosis. We have previously determined that restraint stressed CBA mice had higher levels of mortality following infection with Theiler's virus. We proposed that this was due to high levels of stress-induced corticosterone, which resulted in decreased numbers of circulating lymphocytes, decreased inflammatory cell infiltrates into the brain and consequently decreased viral clearance from the central nervous system (CNS). The effect of restraint stress on the innate immune response to Theiler's virus is further investigated in the current study. Restraint stressed mice developed clinical signs of encephalitis, thymic atrophy, and adrenal hypertrophy. Decreased numbers of circulating lymphocytes and increased numbers of neutrophils were observed in the stressed mice. Stressed mice also had lower numbers of spleen cells which correlated with the decreased numbers of lymphocytes in circulation. Restraint stress caused elevations in serum tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha). Virus-induced natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxic activity was significantly reduced in restrained mice at one day post infection which may account for the reduced viral clearance from the CNS.

The authors evaluated the presence and the distribution of villous atrophy in children with celiac disease to see whether this histologic pattern exists in children.
METHODS: We studied 95 children at diagnosis (Group 1) and seven during gluten challenge (Group 2). We measured anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) by immunofluorescence on monkey esophagus, antihuman-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (anti-tTG Abs) by radioimmunoprecipitation, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 heterodimers by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers. During upper intestinal endoscopy, at least five duodenal biopsy samples were obtained, one from the duodenal bulb and four from the distal duodenum.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 95 (13.7%) patients in Group 1 and in 3 of 7 (42.9%) in Group 2 had patchy villous atrophy of the duodenum. In all 16 patients, villous atrophy of the bulb was present. In four children from Group 1, villous atrophy was observed only in the bulb samples. EMA, anti-tTG Abs, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 heterodimers were present in all patients.

To our knowledge, however, the clinical correlates of major depression have not been extensively studied.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical, neuropsychological, and structural neuroimaging correlates of major depression occurring after TBI.
DESIGN: Prospective, case-controlled, surveillance study conducted during the first year after the traumatic episode occurred. Settings University hospital level I trauma center and a specialized rehabilitation unit.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 91 patients with TBI. In addition, 27 patients with multiple traumas but without evidence of central nervous system injury constituted the control group. The patients' conditions were evaluated at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after the traumatic episode. Psychiatric diagnosis was made using a structured clinical interview and DSM-IV criteria. Neuropsychological testing and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging were performed at the 3-month follow-up visit.
RESULTS: Major depressive disorder was observed in 30 (33%) of 91 patients during the first year after sustaining a TBI. Major depressive disorder was significantly more frequent among patients with TBI than among the controls. Patients with TBI who had major depression were more likely to have a personal history of mood and anxiety disorders than patients who did not have major depression. Patients with major depression exhibited comorbid anxiety (76.7%) and aggressive behavior (56.7%). Patients with major depression had significantly greater impairment in executive functions than their nondepressed counterparts.

CONCLUSIONS: Major depression is a frequent complication of TBI that hinders a patient's recovery. It is associated with executive dysfunction, negative affect, and prominent anxiety symptoms. The neuropathological changes produced by TBI may lead to deactivation of lateral and dorsal prefrontal cortices and increased activation of ventral limbic and paralimbic structures including the amygdala.","2004",,"Arch Gen Psychiatry"," OBJECTIVE : To determine the clinical , neuropsychological , and structural neuroimaging correlates of major depression occurring after TBI ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aggression, FALSE, psychology, Q000523, Anxiety Disorders, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Atrophy, FALSE, Brain Injuries, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Brain Injury, Chronic, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Causality, FALSE, Comorbidity, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Depressive Disorder, Major, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Iowa, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple Trauma, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Neuropsychological Tests, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Personality Inventory, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Prefrontal Cortex, FALSE, injuries, Q000293, Psychometrics, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The aims of this study were to explore (1) the behavioral and histopathological consequences of combined MPTP plus 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) intoxication in C57/Bl6 mice and (2) its ability to reproduce the neuropathological hallmarks of SND. 3-NP was administered i.p. every 12 h (total dose=450 mg/kg in 9 days) and MPTP i.p. at 10 mg/(kg day) (total dose=90 mg/kg in 9 days). Four groups of mice (n=10) were compared: control, 3-NP alone, MPTP alone, MPTP + 3-NP. Mice intoxicated with 3-NP and MPTP + 3-NP developed motor symptoms, including hindlimb dystonia and clasping, truncal dystonia and impaired balance adjustments. The severity of motor disorder was worse and lasted longer in MPTP + 3-NP-treated mice compared to 3-NP alone, MPTP alone and controls. 3-NP and MPTP + 3-NP-treated mice also displayed altered gait patterns, impaired motor performance on the pole test, rotarod and traversing a beam tasks and activity parameters. Several of these sensorimotor deficits were also more severe and lasted longer in MPTP + 3-NP-treated mice. Histology demonstrated increased neuronal loss along with astrocytic activation (glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP) and a higher incidence of circumscribed striatal lateral lesions in MPTP + 3-NP-treated mice compared to 3-NP. Neuronal loss and astrocytic activation were increased in the lateral part of the striatum in 3-NP-intoxicated mice while observed both in the medial and lateral part in MPTP + 3-NP-intoxicated mice. There was also a significant loss of SNc dopaminergic neurons and striatal terminals, similar to that in MPTP-treated mice.

At least 2 factors explain this high prevalence. Dopamine-mimetic drugs may induce or enhance the occurrence of OH. Parkinson's disease is a cause of primary autonomic failure with involvement of the peripheral nervous system. CHARACTERISTIC HISTOLOGICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL ELEMENTS: Histology indicates that Lewy bodies exist in the sympathetic glands. Pharmacology reveals cardiac sympathetic denervation. These histological and pharmacological characteristics clearly differentiate autonomic failure of Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy (Shy-Drager's syndrome). If autonomic abnormalities appear to be present since the early stages of the disease, the early onset, within the first year, of symptomatic OH in the course of a parkinsonian syndrome can be considered as an exclusion criterion for idiopathic Parkinson's disease. REGARDING TREATMENT: No specific clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of antihypotensive drugs in the treatment of OH in Parkinson's disease. The management of this symptom requires education of the patient and the development of non-pharmacological measures. Drug therapy should be reserved for symptomatic patients who do not improve with the preceding methods.

Since the regulation system of laryngeal function is closely related to swallowing function, swallowing function is considered to be more involved in MSA patients with VFMI than in patients that do not have VFMI. However, the relationship between dysphagia and VFMI in MSA patients has not been systematically explored.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the relationship between VFMI and dysphagia in MSA.
METHODS: We evaluated swallowing function of 36 MSA patients with and without VFMI, by videofluoroscopy, and investigated the relationship between VFMI and pharyngeal swallowing function.
RESULTS: VFMI was found in 17 patients (47.2%). Patients with VFMI had advanced severity of the disease. Although there was a tendency for bolus stasis at the pyriform sinus and the upper oesophageal sphincter opening to be more involved in patients with VFMI, statistical analysis did not show significant differences in swallowing function of MSA patients between with and without VFMI. In contrast, patients who underwent a tracheotomy ultimately required tube feeding or a laryngectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Appearance of VFMI is a sign of disease progression but does not necessary mean patients should change their way of taking nutrition.

We now report identification by sequencing, restriction endonuclease analyses, and clonal analyses of a heteroplasmic missense A to G base pair substitution at nucleotide position 3796 (A3796G) in the gene encoding the ND1 subunit of mitochondrial complex I in a patient with adult-onset dystonia, spasticity, and core-type myopathy. The mutation converts a highly conserved threonine to an alanine. The same mutation subsequently was identified in 2 of 74 additional unrelated adult-onset dystonia patients. A muscle biopsy was obtained from 1 of these 2 subjects and this revealed abnormalities of electron transport chain (ETC) activities. The mutation was absent in 64 subjects with early onset dystonia, 82 normal controls, and 65 subjects with Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy. The A3796G mutation previously has been reported in 3 of 226 subjects from mitochondrial haplogroup H. Each of the 3 subjects in our study harboring the A3796G mutation was also from haplogroup H. However, a subgroup analysis of haplogroup H subjects from our study indicates that the A3796G mutation is significantly overrepresented among haplogroup H adult-onset dystonia subjects compared with haplogroup H controls (P<0.01). This difference remains significant even after excluding the index patient (P=0.04).

We examined the participation of dopamine and D1 dopamine receptors in the genesis of postsynaptic neurodegeneration. Chronic treatment of human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells with dopamine or H2O2 increased NO production and accelerated cytotoxicity, as indexed by enhanced nitrite levels and cell death. The antioxidant sodium metabisulfite or SCH 23390, a D1 dopamine receptor-selective antagonist, partially blocked dopamine effects but together ablated dopamine-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating the participation of both autoxidation and D1 receptor stimulation. Direct activation of D1 dopamine receptors with SKF R-38393 caused cytotoxicity, which was refractory to sodium metabisulfite. Dopamine and SKF R-38393 induced overexpression of the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms neuronal NOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS in a protein kinase A-dependent manner. Functional studies showed that approximately 60% of total NOS activity was due to activation of iNOS. The NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and genistein, wortmannin, or NF-kappaB SN50, inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and NF-kappaB, respectively, reduced nitrite production by dopamine and SKF R-38393 but were less effective in attenuating H2O2-mediated effects. In rat striatal neurons, dopamine and SKF R-38393, but not H2O2, accelerated cell death through increased expression of neuronal NOS and iNOS but not endothelial NOS.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a primary, neurodegenerative dementia sharing clinical and pathological characteristics with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Antiubiquitin immunocytochemical staining, developed in the early 1990s, allowed the frequency and distribution of cortical LBs to be defined. More recently, alpha-synuclein antibodies have revealed extensive neuritic pathology in DLB demonstrating a neurobiological link with other ""synucleinopathies"" including PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The most significant correlates of cognitive failure in DLB appear to be with cortical LB and Lewy neurites (LNs) rather than Alzheimer type pathology. Clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB, published in 1996, have been subjected to several validation studies against autopsy findings. These conclude that although diagnostic specificity is high (range 79- 100%, mean 92%), sensitivity is lower (range 0- 83 %, mean, 49%). Improved methods of case detection are therefore required. Fluctuating impairments in attention, visual recognition and construction are more indicative of DLB than AD. Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe volume on structural MRI and the use of SPECT tracers for regional blood flow and the dopamine transporter are the most reliable current biomarkers for DLB. There are no genetic or CSF tests recommended for the diagnosis of DLB at present. Between 15 and 20% of all elderly demented cases reaching autopsy have DLB, making it the most common cause of degenerative dementia after AD. Exquisite, not infrequently fatal, sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs and encouraging reports of the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive, psychiatric and neurological features, mean that an accurate diagnosis of DLB is more than merely of academic interest.

This phenotype is characterized by severe muscle weakness and hypotonia starting prenatally or at birth with a life span not exceeding a few months in most cases. Milder disease courses with later onset and longer survival are normally not diagnosed as PCH-1. We describe the clinical and neuroradiological findings in nine patients out of six siblingships with evidence of cerebellar defects and early onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), representing a broad spectrum of clinical variability. In all patients, the diagnosis of SMA (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) was made on the basis of electrophysiological data and muscle biopsy; however, genetic testing failed to confirm the diagnosis of infantile SMA with a gene defect on chromosome 5q and resulted in clinical reevaluation. Age at onset was after a normal period in the first months of life in three siblingships and pre- and postnatally in the other three families. Life span was 2-4 years in patients with later onset, and age at death occurred after birth or within months in the more severe group. Two siblingships showed discordant ages at death despite similar treatment. In contrast to the previous definition of PCH-1, our observations suggest the existence of milder phenotypes with pontocerebellar hypoplasia or olivopontocerebellar atrophy in combination with anterior horn cell loss. A pontine involvement is not necessarily seen by neuroimaging methods. The genetic basis of PCH-1 remains to be determined.

Alpha-synuclein, a major component of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, has the ability to interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which mediate several types of signal transduction pathways. To elucidate the role of these 14-3-3 proteins in patients with multiple system atrophy, we performed immunohistochemical studies on 14-3-3 in brain tissue specimens from 7 control subjects and from 15 patients with multiple system atrophy. In both control and multiple system atrophy cases, 14-3-3 immunoreactivity was observed mainly in the neuronal somata and proximal processes, as well as the nerve fibers. Even in the severely affected regions of patients with multiple system atrophy, 14-3-3 immunoreactivity generally was spared in the surviving neurons, some of which were strongly immunolabeled. In addition, numerous glial cytoplasmic inclusions were intensely immunostained, and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and dystrophic neurites were also immunoreactive for 14-3-3.

We now report that our mouse model has cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that colocalize with oligodendrocytes and neurons, are positive for alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin, and therefore may be classified as a synucleinopathy. Alpha-synuclein monomers as well as multimers were present in brain extracts from both normal and transgenic mice. However, similar to human MSA and other synucleinopathies, transgenic mice showed an increase in abnormal aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein, which also increased its nitrated content with age. However, the same extracts displayed decreased phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein. Other traits particular to MSA such as Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum and degeneration of the intermediolateral cell columns of the spinal cord also exist in our mouse model but differences still exist between them. Interestingly, long-term therapy with the alpha(1)-AR antagonist, terazosin, resulted in protection against the symptomatic as well as the neurodegeneration and alpha-synuclein inclusion body formation, suggesting that signaling of the alpha(1B)-AR is the cause of the pathology.

Diagnosis is challenging in that patients often suffer from subtle, if any, symptoms. The risk of clinically silent celiac disease is increased in various autoimmune conditions. The endocrinologist, especially, should maintain high suspicion and alertness to celiac disease, which is to be found in 2-5% of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroid disease. Patients with multiple endocrine disorders, Addison's disease, alopecia, or hypophysitis may also have concomitant celiac disease. Similar heredity and proneness to autoimmune conditions are considered to be explanations for these associations. A gluten-free diet is essential to prevent celiac complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and infertility. The diet may also be beneficial in the treatment of the underlying endocrinological disease; prolonged gluten exposure may even contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of celiac disease requires endoscopic biopsy, but serological screening with antiendomysial and antitissue transglutaminase antibody assays is an easy method for preliminary case finding.

,"12040060","Interferon gamma induces retrograde dendritic retraction and inhibits synapse formation.","Kim IJ","The expression of interferon gamma (IFNgamma) increases after neural injury, and it is sustained in chronic inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis and infection with human immunodeficiency virus. To understand how exposure to this proinflammatory cytokine might affect neural function, we examined its effects on cultures of neurons derived from the central and peripheral nervous systems. IFNgamma inhibits initial dendritic outgrowth in cultures of embryonic rat sympathetic and hippocampal neurons, and this inhibitory effect on process growth is associated with a decrease in the rate of synapse formation. In addition, in older cultures of sympathetic neurons, IFNgamma also selectively induces retraction of existing dendrites, ultimately leading to an 88% decrease in the size of the arbor. Dendritic retraction induced by IFNgamma represents a specific cellular response because it occurs without affecting axonal outgrowth or cell survival, and it is not observed with tumor necrosis factor alpha or other inflammatory cytokines. IFNgamma-induced dendritic retraction is associated with the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and expression of a dominant-negative STAT1 construct attenuates the inhibitory effect of IFNgamma. Moreover, retrograde dendritic retraction is observed when distal axons are selectively exposed to IFNgamma. These data imply that IFNgamma-mediated STAT1 activation induces both dendritic atrophy and synaptic loss and that this occurs both at the sites of IFNgamma release and at remote loci.

This is costly and inconvenient for the patient, and there is a need for a simple pregastroscopic screening method to reduce the endoscopy workload. Our aim was to develop a serological screening test for gastritis.
METHODS: Sera from subjects examined with gastroscopy and biopsy were analyzed for H,K-ATPase antibodies, Helicobacter pylori antibodies and pepsinogen I. The diagnoses were normal gastric mucosa (n=50), duodenal ulcer (n=53) and atrophic corpus gastritis, with (n=50) or without pernicious anemia (n=46).
RESULTS: An evaluation scheme was constructed to optimize the diagnostic agreement between serology and gastric mucosal morphology. The sensitivity to detect gastritis was 98% (146/149) (95% CI 94-100%) and the specificity 84% (42/50) (95% CI 71-93%). Additional sera from 483 subjects from the general population were analyzed. There was a good agreement between serology and gastric mucosal morphology.
CONCLUSIONS: Assays of multiple serum analytes are useful for the initial screening of gastritis. They are complementary to upper gastroscopy by identification of subjects with a normal gastric mucosa, those who qualify for eradication of H. pylori, and those who have developed atrophy and are at risk of developing malignancy and, therefore, require gastroscopic examination.","2002",,"Clin Chim Acta"," Our aim was to develop a serological screening test for gastritis ","comparative study","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Biopsy, FALSE, Endoscopy, Digestive System, FALSE, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gastric Mucosa, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Gastritis, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Gastroscopy, FALSE, H(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Helicobacter pylori, FALSE, immunology, Q000276, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Pepsinogen A, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE, Serologic Tests, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The median time from initial symptom to combined motor and autonomic dysfunction was 2 years (range 1-10). Median intervals from onset to aid-requiring walking, confinement to a wheelchair, a bedridden state and death were 3, 5, 8 and 9 years, respectively. Patients manifesting combined motor and autonomic involvement within 3 years of onset had a significantly increased risk of not only developing advanced disease stage but also shorter survival (P < 0.01). MSA-P patients had more rapid functional deterioration than MSA-C patients (aid-requiring walking, P = 0.03; confinement to a wheelchair, P < 0.01; bedridden state, P < 0.01), but showed similar survival. Onset in older individuals showed increased risk of confinement to a wheelchair (P < 0.05), bedridden state (P = 0.03) and death (P < 0.01). Patients initially complaining of motor symptoms had accelerated risk of aid-requiring walking (P < 0.01) and confinement to a wheelchair (P < 0.01) compared with those initially complaining of autonomic symptoms, while the time until confinement to a bedridden state and survival were no worse. Gender was not associated with differences in worsening of function or survival. On MRI, a hyperintense rim at the lateral edge of the dorsolateral putamen was seen in 34.5% of cases, and a 'hot cross bun' sign in the pontine basis (PB) in 63.3%. These putaminal and pontine abnormalities became more prominent as MSA-P and MSA-C features advanced. The atrophy of the cerebellar vermis and PB showed a significant correlation particularly with the interval following the appearance of cerebellar symptoms in MSA-C (r = 0.71, P < 0.01, r = 0.76 and P < 0.01, respectively), but the relationship between atrophy and functional status was highly variable among the individuals, suggesting that other factors influenced the functional deterioration. Atrophy of the corpus callosum was seen in a subpopulation of MSA, suggesting hemispheric involvement in a subgroup of MSA patients. The present study suggested that many factors are involved in the progression of MSA but, most importantly, the interval from initial symptom to combined motor and autonomic dysfunction can predict functional deterioration and survival in MSA.","2002",,"Brain"," We investigated the disease progression and survival in 230 Japanese patients with multiple system atrophy ( MSA ; 131 men , 99 women ; 208 probable MSA , 22 definite ; mean age at onset , 55","comparative study","Activities of Daily Living, FALSE, Disease Progression, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Prognosis, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Survival Analysis, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The extent of striatal dopaminergic denervation can be quantified with radiotracers as [18F]FDopa for PET and [123I]tropanes for SPECT. There are other radiotracers such as [11C]Dopa and meta-tyrosines as well as PET tracers for uptake sites. Striatal uptake of [18F]FDopa and [123I]tropanes is markedly decreased in PD, more in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus, and inversely correlates with the severity of motor signs and with duration of disease. PET and SPECT make possible the assessment by noninvasive means of the changes in dopamine receptor density, the effect of neuronal transplants or neuroprotective treatments in PD patients, or the nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in at-risk subjects. Activation studies using cerebral blood flow and metabolism measurements during a motor task reveal an impaired ability to activate the supplementary motor area and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in PD. This functional disability is reversed by the use of dopaminergic medication or by surgical treatment by pallidotomy or deep brain stimulation. The differential diagnosis between PD and multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration is not yet clearly established by PET and SPECT, even though these syndromes have some particular neurochemical and metabolic profiles. On the other hand, PET and SPECT are useful for distinguishing PD from Dopa-responsive dystonia, or for assessing the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in atypical cases of postural tremor or iatrogenic parkinsonian syndromes.","2001",,"Neurophysiol Clin",," review","Aging, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Animals, FALSE, Antiparkinson Agents, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Basal Ganglia, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Brain Tissue Transplantation, FALSE, Cell Transplantation, FALSE, Cerebrovascular Circulation, FALSE, Diagnosis, Differential, FALSE, Dihydroxyphenylalanine, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Dopamine Agonists, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Electric Stimulation Therapy, FALSE, Fetal Tissue Transplantation, FALSE, Forecasting, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Iatrogenic Disease, FALSE, Imagination, FALSE, Ligands, FALSE, Mesencephalon, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Motor Activity, FALSE, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Neurodegenerative Diseases, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Neurons, FALSE, transplantation, Q000637, Neuroprotective Agents, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Neurotransmitter Agents, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Parkinson Disease, Secondary, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Parkinsonian Disorders, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Radiopharmaceuticals, FALSE, Rats, FALSE, Receptors, Dopamine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Risk, FALSE, Tomography, Emission-Computed, TRUE, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, TRUE, Tremor, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

Expression of Fas, Fas ligand (Fas-L), ERK, MEK, Bcl-2, Bax, N-myc, c-myc, pro-caspase-2 and active caspase-3 was examined by immunohistochemistry in the cerebellum of six patients with sporadic CJD, three patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) and six age-matched controls. No modifications in the expression of these proteins were observed in granule cells in CJD and OPCA when compared with controls, except in a few cells in the molecular and granular layers in CJD that displayed dense homogeneous active caspase-3 immunostaining. This suggests selective activation of caspase-3 in association with increased cellular vulnerability in CJD. No modifications in pro-caspase-2 and c-myc immunoreactivity were observed in Purkinje cells in diseased brains when compared with controls. However, increased diffuse Fas, Fas-L, MEK, ERK and Bax expression, and enhanced granular active caspase-3 immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells in CJD. Increase in Bcl-2 and N-myc occurred in Purkinje cells in CJD and OPCA. These results indicate that enhanced Fas, Fas-L, MERK, ERK, Bax and granular active caspase-3 expression is not lethal to Purkinje cells in CJD, whereas increased Bcl-2 and N-myc does not preclude per se cell death or death survival in CJD and OPCA.

However, the relationship between its accumulation and pathogenesis is still unclear. Recently, we reported that overexpression of alpha-synuclein affects Elk-1 phosphorylation in cultured cells, which is mainly performed by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). We further examined the relationship between MAPK signaling and the effects of alpha-synuclein expression on ecdysone-inducible neuro2a cell lines and found that cells expressing alpha-synuclein had less phosphorylated MAPKs. Moreover, they showed significant cell death when the concentration of serum in the culture medium was reduced. Under normal serum conditions, the addition of the MAPK inhibitor U0126 also caused cell death in alpha-synuclein-expressing cells. Transfection of constitutively active MEK-1 resulted in MAPK phosphorylation in alpha-synuclein-expressing cells and improved cell viability even under reduced serum conditions. Thus, we conclude that alpha-synuclein regulates the MAPK pathway by reducing the amount of available active MAPK.

In vivo, sodium butyrate treatment of SMA-like mice resulted in increased expression of SMN protein in motor neurons of the spinal cord and resulted in significant improvement of SMA clinical symptoms.

In patients with Parkinson's disease, the prevalence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension may be as high as 20%. Two factors could explain this high prevalence. First, dopaminergic drugs may induce or worsen orthostatic hypotension. Secondly, Parkinson's disease is a cause of primary autonomic failure with an involvement of the peripheral autonomic system as shown by the ubiquitous distribution of Lewy bodies and reduced iobenguane [metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)] cardiac uptake. These pathological and pharmacological characteristics clearly differentiate autonomic failure of Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy. If autonomic abnormalities appear to be present from the first stage of the disease, early onset (within the first year) of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension in the course of parkinsonism can be considered as an exclusion criteria for idiopathic Parkinson's disease. No specific clinical trials have evaluated the effects of antihypotensive drugs in patients with Parkinson's disease and thus no specific therapeutic strategy can be recommended. The management of orthostatic hypotension in patients with Parkinson's disease should always start with patient education and nonpharmacological treatment. Drug therapy should be reserved for symptomatic patients who do not get benefit from nonpharmacological management. Among the available drugs, alpha1-adrenergic agonists (mainly midodrine) or plasma volume expanders (mainly fludrocortisone) are the most frequently used. There are also some drugs that are currently investigational such as yohimbine and droxidopa. Other drugs such as desmopressin or octreotide may be of interest in some situations.

In multiple system atrophy, alpha-synuclein conforms the cytoplasmic oligodendroglial inclusions and the neuronal inclusions which are the hallmark of this disease. Finally, the amyloidogenic fragment 61-95 amino acids of alpha-synuclein is the non-Abeta component of senile plaque amyloid in Alzheimer disease. Accumulations of alpha-synuclein in all these disorders have in common a fibrilar configuration, but they differ in the binding of alpha-synuclein to distinct proteins with the exception of ubiquitin whose binding to alpha-synuclein is common to all alpha-synuclein inclusions. The mechanisms leading to alpha-synuclein fragmentation and aggegation into extracellular amyloid are not known, although alpha-synuclein fragment and betaA4 aggregates are the result of abnormal cleavage of large precursors. On the other hand, several studies have shown that alpha-synuclein may adopt a fibrilar conformation and give rise to insoluble forms and high molecular weight aggregates in vitro.

Striatonigral degeneration (SND) and sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy (sOPCA) can progress to include autonomic failure and thus may be forms of MSA, but it is not known whether all such cases progress to MSA. Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) with various ligands, my colleagues and I have investigated the biochemical changes in sOPCA and MSA to understand the relationship between these disorders. An initial study revealed decreased local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in the brainstem, cerebellum, putamen, thalamus and cerebral cortex in both MSA and sOPCA, suggesting that many sOPCA patients would evolve to develop MSA. Later studies confirmed this by demonstrating decreased monoaminergic nigrostriatal terminals in both sOPCA and MSA patients. The studies suggest that the ligand used might be helpful in determining the risk that an individual patient with sOPCA will progress to develop MSA. An investigation of the course of sOPCA patients observed clinically over several years revealed that approximately one-fourth of them progress to MSA within five years. Studies of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A/benzodiazepine neurotransmitter receptors revealed that these sites are largely preserved in sOPCA and MSA, indicating that symptomatic pharmacological therapy may be possible in these disorders.","2001",,"Parkinsonism Relat Disord",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The density of Hp, polymorphonuclear neutrophil activity, chronic inflammation, glandular atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia (IM) were scored according to the updated Sydney System. B-cell monoclonality was analyzed for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement using polymerase chain reaction amplification. B-cell monoclonality was detected in 6% of informative samples. B-cell monoclonality was found in 18% of the samples from Hp-CG patients with marked glandular atrophy but in none of the samples from Hp-CG patients with none to moderate glandular atrophy.

However, the discovery that alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the pathological hallmarks of PD, confirmed its role in PD pathogenesis. Pathological aggregation of the protein might be responsible for neurodegeneration. In addition, soluble oligomers of alpha-synuclein might be even more toxic than the insoluble fibrils found in Lewy bodies. Multiple factors have been shown to accelerate alpha-synuclein aggregation in vitro. Therapeutic strategies aimed to prevent this aggregation are therefore envisaged. Although little has been learned about its normal function, alpha-synuclein appears to interact with a variety of proteins and membrane phospholipids, and may therefore participate in a number of signaling pathways. In particular, it may play a role in regulating cell differentiation, synaptic plasticity, cell survival, and dopaminergic neurotransmission. Thus, pathological mechanisms based on disrupted normal function are also possible.","2000",,"Cell Mol Life Sci"," Therapeutic strategies aimed to prevent this aggregation are therefore envisaged "," review","14-3-3 Proteins, FALSE, Alzheimer Disease, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Animals, FALSE, Carrier Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cell Differentiation, FALSE, Cell Survival, FALSE, Dopamine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Molecular Chaperones, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Neuronal Plasticity, FALSE, Neurons, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Parkinson Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Protein Structure, Tertiary, FALSE, Synucleins, FALSE, Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, alpha-Synuclein, FALSE, tau Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"
,"11176964","Progression of dysarthria and dysphagia in postmortem-confirmed parkinsonian disorders.","Müller J","BACKGROUND: Dysarthria and dysphagia are known to occur in parkinsonian syndromes such as Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Differences in the evolution of these symptoms have not been studied systematically in postmortem-confirmed cases.
OBJECTIVE: To study differences in the evolution of dysarthria and dysphagia in postmortem-confirmed parkinsonian disorders.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three pathologically confirmed cases (PD, n = 17; MSA, n = 15; DLB, n = 14; PSP, n = 24; and CBD, n = 13) formed the basis for a multicenter clinicopathological study organized by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, Md. Cases with enough clinicopathological documentation for the purpose of the study were selected from research and neuropathological files of 7 medical centers in 4 countries (Austria, France, England, and the United States).
RESULTS: Median dysarthria latencies were short in PSP and MSA (24 months each), intermediate in CBD and DLB (40 and 42 months), and long in PD (84 months). Median dysphagia latencies were intermediate in PSP (42 months), DLB (43 months), CBD (64 months), and MSA (67 months), and long in PD (130 months). Dysarthria or dysphagia within 1 year of disease onset was a distinguishing feature for atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs) (specificity, 100%) but failed to further distinguish among the APDs. Survival time after onset of a complaint of dysphagia was similar in PD, MSA, and PSP (15 to 24 months, P =.7) and latency to a complaint of dysphagia was highly correlated with total survival time (rho = 0.88; P<.001) in all disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Latency to onset of dysarthria and dysphagia clearly differentiated PD from the APDs, but did not help distinguish different APDs. Survival after onset of dysphagia was similarly poor among all parkinsonian disorders. Evaluation and adequate treatment of patients with PD who complain of dysphagia might prevent or delay complications such as aspiration pneumonia, which in turn may improve quality of life and increase survival time.","2001",,"Arch Neurol"," OBJECTIVE : To study differences in the evolution of dysarthria and dysphagia in postmortem-confirmed parkinsonian disorders ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Chi-Square Distribution, FALSE, Deglutition Disorders, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Disease Progression, FALSE, Dysarthria, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Parkinsonian Disorders, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Statistics, Nonparametric, FALSE, Survival Rate, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report 9 newborns diagnosed as oxidatic phosporilation deficit during the last 8 years in our hospital by means of clinical, metabolic, pathological and molecular studies, among other evaluations. The diagnosis was established based on ensymatic deficit of the respiratory chain, associated with alterations in the mtDNA in one case, and with mitochondrial ultrastructural anomalies in 5 cases.
RESULTS: There was an incidence of 1/3.555 newborns and 1/832 newborns admitted in our Neonatal Unit. In four of them there were familial antecedents and polihidramnios in two. Most of them, 8 out of 9, were born at term after a normal pregnancy and delivery, with normal Apgar score and auxological examination. Symptomatology started immediately at the neonatal period as acute neurological damage in most of them. There was a severe evolution as 5 children died and 4 survived with severe damage. All of them had the classical phenotype of early severe encefalopathy, associated with dismorphic features, hypotomía, neurosensorial defects, brain dysgenesis and atrophy, anomalies in the EEG and in 5 of them there were also systemic anomalies, mainly cardiopathy. The most frequent biochemical alteration was a significative increment of the quotient lactate/piruvate. Five patients presented ultrastructural alterations of the mitochondria in thr muscle biopsy but Cox stain was not positive in any case. Three cases has a deficit of the complex IV, e of the complex I-IV, 2 of the complex I and one the complex I-III-IV. Only one patient had multiple deletions in the mtDNA.

To investigate the role of GDNF in the human cerebellum, we examined the cerebella of eight control cases and eight patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) immunohistochemically using a polyclonal anti-GDNF antibody. The antibody recognized a single band of approximately 34 kDa on Western blot analysis of human cerebellar homogenates. In the cerebella from normal subjects, the neuronal somata and dendrites of the Purkinje cells were immunostained intensely, as were some axons, including torpedoes, immunolabeled in the granular layer. Many axons and a few oligodendrocytes were also immunopositive in the white matter, and weak immunoreactivity was detected in the granule cells and neurons in the cerebellar nuclei. In the cerebella from patients with MSA, the general immunostaining pattern was similar to that observed in the normal subjects. Most of the remaining Purkinje cells showed strong immunoreactivity, and abundant GDNF-positive granular structures or dense arborizations of GDNF-positive dendrites were found in some areas of the molecular layer. These data suggest that GDNF may be mainly produced and localized in the Purkinje cells of the human cerebellum, even in patients with MSA, and that the functional impairment of the Purkinje cells of MSA patients might cause a focal accumulation of GDNF in the dendrites of some of the surviving Purkinje cells.","2000",,"Acta Neuropathol"," To investigate the role of GDNF in the human cerebellum , we examined the cerebella of eight control cases and eight patients with multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) immunohistochemically using a polyclonal anti-GDNF antibody ","other","Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Blotting, Western, FALSE, Cerebellum, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Immunohistochemistry, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Nerve Growth Factors, TRUE, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Reference Values, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

METHODS: Observations of the course of 51 sOPCA patients 20 years of age or older initially evaluated in an ataxia clinic over 14 years and followed at 3- to 6-month intervals for 3 months to 10 years (median 2.5 years, interquartile range 5 months to 4 years).
RESULTS: Seventeen patients evolved to develop MSA, whereas the remaining 34 manifested only progressively worsening cerebellar ataxia. The features of the MSA cases included autonomic failure and parkinsonism in 10 patients, autonomic failure without parkinsonism in six, and parkinsonism without autonomic failure in one. Using survival analysis methods, the authors estimated that 24% of subjects in this population will evolve to MSA within 5 years of the onset of sOPCA symptoms (95% CI 10% to 36%). An older age at onset of symptoms and a shorter time from onset of symptoms to first presentation in a neurology specialty clinic were both highly predictive of evolution to MSA. Six of the 17 patients who evolved to MSA died 4 months to 5 years after they had met diagnostic criteria for MSA. The estimated median survival time from time of transition was 3.5 years. In contrast, death occurred in only one of the 34 patients with sOPCA who did not evolve to MSA. Autopsy examination of all six patients with MSA who died confirmed the diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-fourth of sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy patients will evolve to multiple system atrophy within 5 years, and this transition carries a poor prognosis for survival.

Nine of 11 patients with stridor died a median of 2 years from presentation and the only two survivors had undergone tracheostomy. Patients with daytime stridor and immobile vocal cords had especially poor prognoses. However, two of four patients with tracheostomies also died, as did six of 19 without stridor. We postulate that central hypoventilation and its complications may have been responsible for many of these other deaths.

Male Wistar rats subjected to a sequential unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the medial forebrain bundle followed by a quinolinic acid lesion of the ipsilateral striatum were divided into four treatment groups, receiving either mesencephalic, striatal, mesencephalic/striatal co-grafts or sham grafts. Amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation behaviour was recorded prior to and up to 10 weeks following transplantation. 6-Hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals showed ipsiversive amphetamine-induced and contraversive apomorphine-induced rotation behaviour. Amphetamine-induced rotation rates persisted after the subsequent quinolinic acid lesion, whereas rotation induced by apomorphine was decreased. In 11 of 14 animals receiving mesencephalic or mesencephalic/striatal co-grafts, amphetamine-induced rotation scores were decreased by >50% at the 10-week post-grafting time-point. In contrast, only one of 12 animals receiving non-mesencephalic (striatal or sham) grafts exhibited diminished rotation rates at this time-point. Apomorphine-induced rotation rates were significantly increased following transplantation of mesencephalic, striatal or sham grafts. The largest increase of apomorphine-induced rotation rates approaching post-6-hydroxydopamine levels were observed in animals with striatal grafts. In contrast, in the co-graft group, there was no significant increase of apomorphine-induced rotation compared to the post-quinolinic acid time-point. Morphometric analysis revealed a 63-74% reduction of striatal surface areas across the treatment groups. Striatal [3H]mazindol binding on the lesioned side (excluding the demarcated graft area) revealed a marked loss of dopamine re-uptake sites across all treatment groups, indicating missing graft-induced dopaminergic re-innervation of the host. In eight (73%) of the 11 animals with mesencephalic grafts and reduced amphetamine-induced circling, discrete areas of [3H]mazindol binding (""hot spots"") were observed, indicating graft survival. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor binding was preserved in the remaining lesioned striatum irrespective of treatment assignment, except for a significant reduction of D2 receptor binding in animals receiving mesencephalic grafts. ""Hot spots"" of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor binding were observed in 10 (83%) and nine (75%) of 12 animals receiving striatal grafts or co-grafts, consistent with survival of embryonic primordial striatum grafted into a severely denervated and lesioned striatum. Our study confirms that functional improvement may be obtained from embryonic neuronal grafts in a double-lesion rat model of multiple system atrophy/striatonigral degeneration type. Co-grafts appear to be required for reversal of both amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation behaviour in this model. We propose that the partial reversal of amphetamine-induced rotation asymmetry in double-lesioned rats receiving mesencephalic or mesencephalic/striatal co-grafts reflects non-synaptic graft-derived dopamine release. The changes of apomorphine-induced rotation following transplantation are likely to reflect a complex interaction of graft- and host-derived striatal projection pathways and basal ganglia output nuclei.

BACKGROUND: No epidemiologic studies have been performed on smoking habits in MSA. A previous investigation in PSP revealed no differences in smoking habits between patients and hospital control subjects.
METHODS: Seventy-six MSA patients, 55 PSP patients, 140 PD patients, and 134 healthy control subjects were enrolled consecutively at seven neurologic clinics from January 1, 1994, to July 31, 1998. Detailed information on smoking habits was obtained using a structured questionnaire.
RESULTS: The comparison between frequencies of never-smokers versus ever-smokers (ex-smokers/current smokers; adjusted odds ratio [ORadj], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.06) and a dose-response analysis for never-smokers, moderate smokers (ORadj, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.32), and heavy smokers (ORadj, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.05) suggest that MSA patients smoke less than population control subjects.

Current information on the frequency, pattern, and prevalence of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism in these communities is unclear and controversial. While several workers have suggested that there is a low prevalence of Parkinson's disease in populations of African origin, other workers have suggested a higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease in African Americans. Furthermore, little information is available in relation to the pattern of parkinsonism in these subjects. A recent phenomenologic study of parkinsonism in the French West Indies by Caparros-Lefebvre and colleagues has indicated a significantly increased frequency of atypical parkinsonism in local non-white subjects. Since 1995, we have been studying the pattern and frequency of parkinsonism in Afro-Caribbean and Indian (originating from the Indian subcontinent) patients living in the UK, with London serving as the coordinating center. Our results indicate that there is a three- to fourfold increase in the frequency of occurrence of sporadic atypical parkinsonism characterized by levodopa hyporesponsiveness, bradykinesia-dominant disease, and early cognitive dysfunction in these patients even after exclusion of patients with clinically probable multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Lewy body dementia. These findings are similar to observations made in the French West Indies. Ongoing studies in India suggest that atypical parkinsonism also affects local patients, and the pattern of parkinsonism tends to differ from Afro-Caribbean subjects in the UK. Studies are currently underway to unravel the mechanism of increased frequency of atypical parkinsonism in these ethnic groups and include genetic studies addressing polymorphisms of enzymes metabolizing levodopa, dietary neurotoxin screen and functional imaging studies of the striatum using positron emission tomography.

In rat sympathetic ganglia decentralization leads to new synapse formation. We explored whether these synapses are functional, and whether chronically decentralized neurones respond normally to activation, in terms of exocytosis. Potassium depolarization and cholinergic agonists were applied to freshly excised rat superior cervical sympathetic ganglia, preganglionically denervated with prevented reinnervation 5 months earlier. Ganglia were incubated and stimulated in the presence of tannic acid, which stabilizes released vesicle cores for subsequent electron microscopy. In denervated ganglia exocytosis was observed from newly formed synaptic nerve terminals, and from nonsynaptic surfaces of neurone somata and dendrites. The results demonstrated that the new intraganglionic synapses, which are mostly catecholaminergic, can function and that chronically decentralized sympathetic neurones remain capable of stimulant-induced exocytosis from somata and dendrites. The maximal release upon potassium depolarization did not differ significantly between denervated and contralateral ganglia. Relative to this, the exocytotic responses of decentralized somata and dendrites to nicotine resembled those of contralateral ganglia. Responses to muscarine were significantly less in denervated than in contralateral ganglia, indicating inhibition in dendrites. Responses to carbachol suggested interactions between nicotinic and excitatory muscarinic effects. Nerve terminals in denervated ganglia showed high basal release. Their responses to muscarine and carbachol resembled those of the decentralized neurones, from which most may originate. Their response to nicotine evidenced inhibition. Their actions, coupled with nonsynaptic effects of soma-dendritic exocytosis, might modulate responses of the decentralized neurone population to other surviving inputs.

,"10495104","Molecular mechanisms regulating motor neuron development and degeneration.","Kilpatrick TJ","Motor neurons are a well-defined, although heterogeneous group of cells responsible for transmitting information from the central nervous system to the locomotor system. Spinal motor neurons are specified by soluble factors produced by structures adjacent to the primordial spinal cord, signaling through homeodomain proteins. Axonal pathfinding is regulated by cell-surface receptors that interact with extracellular ligands and once synaptic connections have formed, the survival of the somatic motor neuron is dependent on the provision of target-derived growth factors, although nontarget-derived factors, produced by either astrocytes or Schwann cells, are also potentially implicated. Somatic motor neuron degeneration leads to profound disability, and multiple pathogenetic mechanisms including aberrant growth factor signaling, abnormal neurofilament accumulation, excitotoxicity, and autoimmunity have been postulated to be responsible. Even when specific deficits have been identified, for example, mutations of the superoxide dismutase-1 gene in familial amyotrophic sclerosis and polyglutamine expansion of the androgen receptor in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, the mechanisms by which somatic motor neuronal degeneration occurs remain unclear. In order to treat motor system degeneration effectively, we will need to understand these mechanisms more thoroughly.","1999",,"Mol Neurobiol",," review","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Amino Acid Transport System X-AG, FALSE, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Animals, FALSE, Cell Death, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Growth Substances, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Humans, FALSE, Motor Neurons, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Muscular Atrophy, Spinal, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Nerve Degeneration, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The percentage of patients with MSA among the cases of spinocerebellar degeneration was 40% in National Tokyo Hospital. There were 12 women and 9 men, and the mean age at onset was 56 years. Seventy-four percent of MSA patients was olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), 22% was striatonigral degeneration (SND). The mean age of 17 deceased patients (10 women, and 7 men) was 65.5 years. Ten patients did not undergo tracheostomy and deceased, and 11 patients underwent tracheostomy, among whom 4 patients are still alive. Mean duration of illness from onset to death (without tracheostomy) or tracheostomy was 6.8 years. Cause of death of patients who did not undergo tracheostomy was related to paresis of the larynx or pharynx, for example, aspiration pneumonia due to dysphagia, vocal cord paralysis and sudden death. Some of those who underwent tracheostomy deceased for causes which were not directly related to MSA such as cerebral hemorrhage or uremia, but others seem to be related to some problems of respiratory center such as central chronic respiratory failure, or sudden death (sometimes it happened after infection, but the obstruction of the respiratory tract was not always present at autopsy).","1999",,"Rinsho Shinkeigaku",,"other","Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Prognosis, FALSE, Survival Analysis, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE, Tracheostomy, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"

The findings were correlated with the results of neurological evaluations and magnetic resonance imaging studies. Specific binding was significantly reduced in the putamen of all patient groups in the order MSA-P < MSA-C < sOPCA, compared with controls. Mean blood-to-brain ligand transport (K1) was significantly decreased in the putamen of all patient groups and in the cerebellar hemispheres of MSA-C and sOPCA but not MSA-P groups, compared with controls. Significant negative correlations were found between striatal binding and the intensity of parkinsonian features and between cerebellar K1 and the intensity of cerebellar dysfunction. The results suggest fundamental differences between MSA-P and MSA-C groups reflecting differential severity of degeneration of nigrostriatal and cerebellar systems in these two forms of MSA. The findings also show that some sOPCA patients have subclinical nigrostriatal dysfunction and are at risk of developing MSA with disease progression.","1999",,"Ann Neurol",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Brain, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Corpus Striatum, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multiple System Atrophy, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Tetrabenazine, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Tomography, Emission-Computed, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"
,"9987028","Intrastriatal grafting of a GDNF-producing cell line protects striatonigral neurons from quinolinic acid excitotoxicity in vivo.","Pérez-Navarro E","Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a neurotrophic factor with a therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders. GDNF is expressed in the adult striatum, but its signalling tyrosine kinase receptor, c-ret, has not been detected in this structure by in situ hybridization. In the present work, we first examined c-ret and GDNF receptor alpha 1 (GFR-alpha 1) expression using an RNAse protection assay, and found that both receptors are expressed in the adult rat striatum. We then examined whether GDNF was able to regulate the phenotype and/or prevent the degeneration of striatal projection neurons in a well-characterized model of excitotoxic damage. A fibroblast cell line, engineered to overexpress GDNF, was grafted in adult rats striatum 24 h before quinolinic acid (QUIN) injection. QUIN injection alone or in combination with the control cell line induced a loss of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD)-, preprotachykinin A (PPTA)-, prodynorphin (DYN)- and preproenkephalin (PPE)-positive neurons. GDNF selectively prevented: (i) the loss of a subpopulation of striatonigral neurons expressing GAD and PPTA; (ii) the atrophy of PPTA-positive neurons; and (iii) the decrease in GAD, PPTA and DYN mRNA expression, after QUIN injection. Moreover, in unlesioned animals, GDNF increased the size of PPTA-positive neurons and up-regulated their mRNA levels. In contrast, GDNF showed no effect in intact or lesioned striatopallidal PPE-positive neurons. Thus, our findings show that GDNF selectively regulates the phenotype and protects striatonigral neurons from QUIN-induced excitotoxicity, suggesting that GDNF may be used for the treatment of striatonigral degenerative disorders, e.g. Huntington's disease and multiple system atrophy.","1999",,"Eur J Neurosci",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Brain Tissue Transplantation, TRUE, Cell Death, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Cell Survival, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Corpus Striatum, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Drosophila Proteins, TRUE, Enkephalins, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Fluorescent Dyes, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, FALSE, Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, FALSE, Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors, FALSE, Glutamate Decarboxylase, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Graft Survival, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, In Situ Hybridization, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Nerve Growth Factors, TRUE, Nerve Tissue Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Neurons, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Neuroprotective Agents, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Neurotoxins, FALSE, Protein Precursors, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret, FALSE, Quinolinic Acid, FALSE, RNA, Messenger, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Inbred F344, FALSE, Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Recombinant Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Stilbamidines, TRUE, Substantia Nigra, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Tachykinins, FALSE, analysis, Q000032",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"
,"9838257","Mortality in blind subjects. A population-based study on social security files from Baden-Württemberg.","Krumpaszky HG","BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated that mortality is increased in blind subjects. However, no detailed analysis with respect to causes of blindness and the effect of additional diseases has been performed. The present study was undertaken to examine these questions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation is based on social security files from the Württemberg-Hohenzollern region (population 5.5 millions) in Germany. In total, 571 files of blind subjects whose blindness benefits terminated (mostly due to death) in 1994 were included. Medical opinions on ophthalmological status and general health were extracted from the files. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) on the basis of life tables of former West Germany were calculated using maximum likelihood methods taking into account censoring.
RESULTS: Most subjects in our study had one or more additional diseases at onset of blindness (74%). The SMR in all blind is 1.41 [95% CI (confidence interval) = 1.28-1.54; n= 571]. Mortality of blind subjects is increased if subjects suffer from multiple disease at onset of blindness: the SMR in blind with multiple diseases is 1.76 (95% CI = 1.58-1.94; n = 421) versus 0.85 (CI = 0.70-1.0; n = 150) in otherwise healthy blind subjects. In cases where specifically ocular diseases were responsible for the visual loss, the symbol [M] indicates that the blind subject suffered from multiple disease at onset of blindness and [E] denotes that this was not the case. The SMRs for main causes of blindness are: macular degeneration [M] 1.5 (CI = 1.3-1.8; n = 123), [E] 1.1 (CI = 0.8-1.5; n = 43); glaucoma [M] 1.6 (CI = 1.3-2.1; n = 65), [E] 1.0 (CI = 0.6-1.5; n = 26); high myopia [M] 1.2 (CI = 0.8-1.7; n = 32), [E] 0.8 (CI = 0.5-1.2; n = 21); optic atrophy [M] 1.1 (CI = 0. 6-1.8; n = 19), [E] 1.4 (CI = 0.4-3.2; n = 4), and tapetoretinal degeneration [M] 2.3 (CI = 1.1- 4.2; n = 10), [E] 0.9 (CI = 0.4-1.8; n = 12). The SMR of cases of blindness in conjunction with other diseases was fairly high for diabetic retinopathy: 5.5 (CI = 4.4-6. 8; n = 81). Central-nervous-system-triggered blindness led to an SMR of 1.5 (CI = 1.0-2.2; n = 37).
DISCUSSION: According to the results of the present study mortality is significantly increased in blind subjects. However, increased mortality in cases of blindness due to specifically ocular disease (e.g. macular degeneration) is associated with the presence of multiple (extra-ocular) diseases at onset of blindness.","1999",,"Ophthalmologica",,"comparative study","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Age of Onset, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Blindness, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Germany, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Humans, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Life Tables, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Population Surveillance, FALSE, Registries, TRUE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Social Security, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Visual Acuity, FALSE, Visual Fields, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoMSA","2024-02-05"
