,"30970355"," Iron Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease. ","Gafter-Gvili A. et al.","Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD patients suffer from both absolute and functional iron deficiency. Absolute iron deficiency is defined by severely reduced or absent iron stores, while functional iron deficiency is defined by adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability for incorporation into erythroid precursors. This is due to increased levels of hepcidin. Anemia in CKD is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The association between anemia and mortality may be related to the severity of anemia. All CKD patients should be screened for anemia during the initial evaluation for CKD. Criteria used to define iron deficiency are different among CKD compared to normal renal function. Among CKD patients, absolute iron deficiency is defined when the transferrin saturation (TSAT) is ≤20% and the serum ferritin concentration is ≤100 ng/mL among predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients or ≤200 ng/mL among hemodialysis patients. Functional iron deficiency, also known as iron-restricted erythropoiesis, is characterized by TSAT ≤20% and elevated ferritin levels. Iron supplementation is recommended for all CKD patients with anemia. There is general agreement according to guidelines that intravenous (i.v.) iron supplementation is the preferred method for CKD patients on dialysis (CKD stage 5D) and either i.v. or oral iron is recommended for patients with CKD ND (CKD stages 3-5). In this review we discuss the evidence base for these recommendations.","2019","Acta haematologica",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Batchelor E. et al.","Anemia is a complication that affects a majority of individuals with advanced CKD. Although relative deficiency of erythropoietin production is the major driver of anemia in CKD, iron deficiency stands out among the mechanisms contributing to the impaired erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced kidney function. Iron deficiency plays a significant role in anemia in CKD. This may be due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation. The traditional biomarkers used for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with CKD have limitations, leading to persistent challenges in the detection and monitoring of IDA in these patients. Here, we review the pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD, we discuss the literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of IDA in CKD, and we summarize the available oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD. Two important issues are addressed, including the potential risks of a more liberal approach to iron supplementation as well as the potential risks and benefits of IV versus oral iron supplementation in patients with CKD.","2020","Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN"," Here , we review the pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD , we discuss the literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of IDA in CKD , and we summarize the available oral and intravenous ( IV ) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"33123967"," Burden of Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: Beyond Erythropoietin. ","Hanna R. et al.","Anemia is a frequent comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with a considerable burden because of decreased patient health-related quality of life and increased healthcare resource utilization. Based on observational data, anemia is associated with an increased risk of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. The current standard of care includes oral or intravenous iron supplementation, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and red blood cell transfusion. However, each of these therapies has its own set of population-specific patient concerns, including increased risk of cardiovascular disease, thrombosis, and mortality. Patients receiving dialysis or those who have concurrent diabetes or high blood pressure may be at greater risk of developing these complications. In particular, treatment with high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has been associated with increased rates of hospitalization, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents remains a therapeutic challenge in a subset of patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor transcription factors, which regulate several genes involved in erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, can be stabilized by a new class of drugs that act as inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase enzymes to promote erythropoiesis and elevate hemoglobin levels. Here, we review the burden of anemia of chronic kidney disease, the shortcomings of current standard of care, and the potential practical advantages of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors in the treatment of patients with anemia of CKD.","2021","Advances in therapy"," Here , we review the burden of anemia of chronic kidney disease , the shortcomings of current standard of care , and the potential practical advantages of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors in the treatment of patients with anemia of CKD ","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This article examines the structural characteristics and trial data enabling regulatory approval of these novel oral agents. Newer intravenous iron therapies, including ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose, allow for fewer infusions and decreased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Concerns about adverse effects such as cardiovascular events and infections are discussed. The potential risk of 6H syndrome (high FGF-23, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, hypovitaminosis D, hypocalcemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism) due to these intravenous agents is emphasized. The proposed pathophysiology of 6H syndrome and hypophosphatemia is described. Ferric pyrophosphate citrate enables administration of iron for repletion through dialysate.

Patients are most commonly managed with oral or intravenous iron supplements and with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). However, these treatments have associated risks, and sometimes are insufficiently effective. Nonetheless, in the last years, there have been some remarkable advances in the treatment of CKD-related anemia, which have raised great expectations. On the one hand, a novel family of drugs has been developed: the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs). These agents induce, among other effects, an increase in the production of endogenous EPO, improve iron availability and reduce hepcidin levels.

LI","Ueda N. and Takasawa K.","Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major problem in chronic kidney disease (CKD), causing increased mortality. Ferritin stores iron, representing iron status. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, thereby inhibiting iron absorption/efflux. Inflammation in CKD increases ferritin and hepcidin independent of iron status, which reduce iron availability. While intravenous iron therapy (IIT) is superior to oral iron therapy (OIT) in CKD patients with inflammation, OIT is as effective as IIT in those without. Inflammation reduces predictive values of ferritin and hepcidin for iron status and responsiveness to iron therapy. Upper limit of ferritin to predict iron overload is higher in CKD patients with inflammation than in those without. However, magnetic resonance imaging studies show lower cutoff levels of serum ferritin to predict iron overload in dialysis patients with apparent inflammation than upper limit of ferritin proposed by international guidelines. Compared to CKD patients with inflammation, optimal ferritin levels for IDA are lower in those without, requiring reduced iron dose and leading to decreased mortality. The management of IDA should differ between CKD patients with and without inflammation and include minimization of inflammation. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of inflammation on ferritin, hepcidin and therapeutic strategy for IDA in CKD.","2018","Nutrients",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The analysis was limited to adults aged >18 who participated in both the interview and exam components of the survey. Three outcomes were assessed: the prevalence of CKD, the prevalence of anemia in subjects with CKD, and the self-reported treatment of anemia. CKD was classified into 5 stages based on the glomerular filtration rate and evidence of kidney damage, in accordance with the guidelines of the National Kidney Foundation. Anemia was defined as serum hemoglobin levels ≤12 g/dL in women and ≤13 g/dL in men. We found that an estimated 14.0% of the US adult population had CKD in 2007-2010. Anemia was twice as prevalent in people with CKD (15.4%) as in the general population (7.6%). The prevalence of anemia increased with stage of CKD, from 8.4% at stage 1 to 53.4% at stage 5. A total of 22.8% of CKD patients with anemia reported being treated for anemia within the previous 3 months-14.6% of patients at CKD stages 1-2 and 26.4% of patients at stages 3-4.

In this review, we highlight the differences in regulatory mechanisms as well as pathophysiology of ID in CKD and HF population both at the systemic and cellular levels. We will review the major clinical trials in HF patients that have shown symptomatic benefit from IV iron supplementation but without effect on clinical outcomes. Intravenous iron loading bypasses the mechanisms that tightly regulate iron uptake and can potentially cause myocardial and endothelial damage by releasing reactive oxygen species.

","Singh A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease, usually develops as a consequence of erythropoietin deficiency. Recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) is indicated for the correction of anemia associated with this condition. However, the optimal level of hemoglobin correction is not defined. METHODS: In this open-label trial, we studied 1432 patients with chronic kidney disease, 715 of whom were randomly assigned to receive a dose of epoetin alfa targeted to achieve a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g per deciliter and 717 of whom were assigned to receive a dose targeted to achieve a level of 11.3 g per deciliter. The median study duration was 16 months. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure (without renal replacement therapy), and stroke. RESULTS: A total of 222 composite events occurred: 125 events in the high-hemoglobin group, as compared with 97 events in the low-hemoglobin group (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.74; P=0.03). There were 65 deaths (29.3%), 101 hospitalizations for congestive heart failure (45.5%), 25 myocardial infarctions (11.3%), and 23 strokes (10.4%). Seven patients (3.2%) were hospitalized for congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction combined, and one patient (0.5%) died after having a stroke. Improvements in the quality of life were similar in the two groups. More patients in the high-hemoglobin group had at least one serious adverse event.

","Liu J. et al.","The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide and the current prevalence rate is 13.4%. There are > 120 million CKD patients in China and this number is expected to increase. One of the main abnormalities in patients with CKD and kidney impairment is decreased synthesis of erythropoietin (EPO), which causes anemia and affects iron metabolism. The probability of developing is higher in anemia patients with CKD than in the general population, and the incidence increases as kidney function decreases. Deficient EPO production by the kidney is the most important cause of renal anemia. Notably, anemia in patients with CKD has multiple causes, such as bleeding caused by platelet dysfunction, iron deficiency due to digestive and absorption disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and shorter red blood cell life. Anemia is also a leading cause of hospitalization in patients with CKD. A new oral medication to treat renal anemia, the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor called roxadustat (FG-4592), regulates iron metabolism and promotes erythropoiesis. This drug has a therapeutic effect on patients with CKD. Roxadustat showed advantages over EPO in clinical experiments.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been the mainstay of renal anemia treatment. However, there are several safety drawbacks, and a safer and more effective alternative treatment has been sought. AREAS COVERED: Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) have been developed as a novel orally active therapeutic agent for renal anemia. HIF-PHIs stimulate endogenous EPO and optimize iron utilization. Roxadustat is a first-in-class HIF-PHI for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients approved in China, Japan, South Korea, and Chile. The authors herein evaluate the pharmacology of roxadustat and give their expert perspectives on its use. EXPERT OPINION: Phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated that roxadustat effectively increases and maintains hemoglobin (Hb) levels in both nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients. Roxadustat also improved iron metabolism and reduced intravenous (IV) iron requirements. However, pooled analyses of phase 3 studies have revealed frequent thromboembolic events in the roxadustat group, which might be attributed to rapid changes in Hb and inadequate iron supplementation. Roxadustat is an attractive alternative treatment especially for patients with ESA hyporesponsive due to impaired iron utilization, and so appropriate selection of target patients and its proper use are crucially important.","2022","Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Koury M. et al.","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop anemia largely because of inappropriately low erythropoietin (EPO) production and insufficient iron available to erythroid precursors. In four phase 3, randomized, open-label, clinical trials in dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD and anemia, the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, vadadustat, was noninferior to the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, darbepoetin alfa, in increasing and maintaining target hemoglobin concentrations. In these trials, vadadustat increased the concentrations of serum EPO, the numbers of circulating erythrocytes, and the numbers of circulating reticulocytes. Achieved hemoglobin concentrations were similar in patients treated with either vadadustat or darbepoetin alfa, but compared with patients receiving darbepoetin alfa, those receiving vadadustat had erythrocytes with increased mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, while the red cell distribution width was decreased. Increased serum transferrin concentrations, as measured by total iron-binding capacity, combined with stable serum iron concentrations, resulted in decreased transferrin saturation in patients randomized to vadadustat compared with patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa. The decreases in transferrin saturation were associated with relatively greater declines in serum hepcidin and ferritin in patients receiving vadadustat compared with those receiving darbepoetin alfa. These results for serum transferrin saturation, hepcidin, ferritin, and erythrocyte indices were consistent with improved iron availability in the patients receiving vadadustat. Thus, overall, vadadustat had beneficial effects on three aspects of erythropoiesis in patients with anemia associated with CKD: increased endogenous EPO production, improved iron availability to erythroid cells, and increased reticulocytes in the circulation.","2022","American journal of hematology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

For more than 3 decades, however, nephrologists have focused primarily on the correction of anemia. The achievement of target hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations is prioritized over repletion of iron stores, and iron status is generally a secondary consideration only assessed in those patients with anemia. Historically, the correction of ID independent of anemia has not been a primary focus in the management of CKD. In contrast, ID is a key therapeutic target in the setting of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); correction of ID in this population improves functional status and quality of life and may improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Given the strong interrelationships between HF and CKD, it is reasonable to consider whether iron therapy alone may benefit those with CKD and evidence of ID irrespective of Hgb concentration. In this review, we differentiate anemia from ID by considering both epidemiologic and pathophysiological perspectives and by reviewing the evidence linking correction of ID to outcomes in patients with HF and/or CKD.

Oral and intravenous iron agents are both available to replete iron in patients with chronic kidney disease diagnosed with iron deficiency. The choice of which agent to use is most often dictated by goals of therapy, tolerability, convenience, and response to prior therapy. Diminished absorption of iron in the gastrointestinal tract and a high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects can reduce the efficacy of oral iron agents, necessitating the use of i.v. iron formulations to treat iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients requiring kidney replacement therapy. Newer oral agents may help to overcome these limitations and help treat iron deficiency in those not requiring kidney replacement therapy.

LI","Begum S. and Latunde-Dada G.","Iron is vital for a vast variety of cellular processes and its homeostasis is strictly controlled and regulated. Nevertheless, disorders of iron metabolism are diverse and can be caused by insufficiency, overload or iron mal-distribution in tissues. Iron deficiency (ID) progresses to iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) after iron stores are depleted. Inflammation is of diverse etiology in anemia of chronic disease (ACD). It results in serum hypoferremia and tissue hyperferritinemia, which are caused by elevated serum hepcidin levels, and this underlies the onset of functional iron-deficiency anemia. Inflammation is also inhibitory to erythropoietin function and may directly increase hepcidin level, which influences iron metabolism. Consequently, immune responses orchestrate iron metabolism, aggravate iron sequestration and, ultimately, impair the processes of erythropoiesis. Hence, functional iron-deficiency anemia is a risk factor for several ailments, disorders and diseases. Therefore, therapeutic strategies depend on the symptoms, severity, comorbidities and the associated risk factors of anemia. Oral iron supplements can be employed to treat ID and mild anemia particularly, when gastrointestinal intolerance is minimal. Intravenous (IV) iron is the option in moderate and severe anemic conditions, for patients with compromised intestinal integrity, or when oral iron is refractory. Erythropoietin (EPO) is used to treat functional iron deficiency, and blood transfusion is restricted to refractory patients or in life-threatening emergency situations.

To repair iron-deficiency anemia, replacement of iron is needed. Iron can be replaced either by the oral route or by the intravenous route. In a meta-analysis, 5 of the 6 trials were short-term, 1 to 3 months, and compared to oral iron, the mean increase in hemoglobin with intravenous iron was only 0.31 g/dL. However, one of the studies included in this meta-analysis was 6 months long and had a mean decline in hemoglobin of 0.52 g/dL associated with intravenous iron administration. Given the short duration of most of the clinical trials comparing oral with intravenous administration of iron the long-term safety of these modes of administration of supplemental iron could not be assessed. Replacement of iron by the oral route is associated with mostly minor complications such as black stools, constipation, and abdominal discomfort. In contrast, intravenous administration of iron may lead to severe adverse events such as anaphylaxis and, as a more recent randomized trial has suggested, delayed complications such as infections and cardiovascular disease. Delayed complications of repeated intravenous iron use are difficult to recognize at an individual level therefore inpatients who have had recent cardiovascular events or are infected, intravenous iron should probably be avoided. Balancing safety and efficacy would require clinical judgment because 1 size may not fit all till we have better data to support the liberal use of parenteral iron.","2017","Hemodialysis international.

Iron deficiency, absolute and functional, with and without anemia, is associated with adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Heart failure and CKD frequently occur together. Intravenous iron therapy has been shown to reduce heart failure symptoms and improve physical function in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with iron deficiency. In CKD, intravenous or oral iron therapy are often used for management of anemia, along with erythropoiesis stimulating agents, yet the risks and benefits of intravenous iron use is controversial. In this review, we survey available evidence and ongoing studies of iron deficiency and iron supplementation in heart failure, and integrate with recent evidence on effectiveness and safety of intravenous iron therapy in CKD. RECENT FINDINGS: Intravenous iron therapy improves heart failure symptoms and physical function in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency, regardless of anemia, and may reduce heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Sustained intravenous iron therapy regardless of hemoglobin level in selected patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis improves outcomes, and does not appear to cause infectious complications.

","Cernaro V. et al.","Erythropoiesis is triggered by hypoxia and is strictly regulated by hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and vitamins to ensure an adequate oxygen delivery to all body cells. Abnormalities in one or more of these factors may induce different kinds of anemia requiring different treatments. A key player in red blood cell production is erythropoietin. It is a glycoprotein hormone, mainly produced by the kidneys, that promotes erythroid progenitor cell survival and differentiation in the bone marrow and regulates iron metabolism. A deficit in erythropoietin synthesis is the main cause of the normochromic normocytic anemia frequently observed in patients with progressive chronic kidney disease. The present review summarizes the most recent findings about each step of the erythropoietic process, going from the renal oxygen sensing system to the cascade of events induced by erythropoietin through its own receptor in the bone marrow. The paper also describes the new class of drugs designed to stabilize the hypoxia-inducible factor by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase, with a discussion about their metabolism, disposition, efficacy, and safety. According to many trials, these drugs seem able to simulate tissue hypoxia and then stimulate erythropoiesis in patients affected by renal impairment. In conclusion, the in-depth investigation of all events involved in erythropoiesis is crucial to understand anemia pathophysiology and to identify new therapeutic strategies, in an attempt to overcome the potential side effects of the commonly used erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.","2019","Medicinal research reviews",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) treatments targeting mild anemia (10-12 g/dl) can decrease the risk of occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure. As the large randomized controlled trials such as Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta, Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency and Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Thearpy in the Western countries suggested, we do not recommend high doses of ESA to achieve the target hemoglobin (Hb) level. The target Hb of >13 g/dl might lead to increase in the risk of CVD although maintaining a high Hb of >12 g/dl without ESA is not harmful for CKD patients. It is desirable to determine the target Hb in dialysis patients depending on their ages. Renal anemia should be monitored constantly to start ESA and iron replacement therapy at an appropriate time, while avoiding their excess in order to minimize the occurrence of CVD and other complications. Taken all the international guidelines and our clinical experiences together, we should consider administration of ESA when the Hb level becomes <11 g/dl in pre-dialysis patients and <10 g/dl in dialysis patients.","2015","Nephron",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Roxadustat use was associated with a greater reduction in serum ferritin levels than seen with ESAs and an increase in serum iron levels compared to a decrease with ESAs. Decreases in transferrin saturation in patients treated with roxadustat were relatively small and, in the case of patients with NDD CKD, not observed by Week 52. These changes reflect the concomitant increases in both serum iron and total iron-binding capacity. Compared to placebo and an ESA, roxadustat improved iron availability and increased erythropoiesis while requiring less intravenous iron use. Hepcidin levels generally decreased in patients who received roxadustat compared to baseline values in all CKD populations; these decreases appear to be more robust with roxadustat than with an ESA or placebo.

Here, we review recent literature that extends our current knowledge on the interactions between FGF23 and anemia in CKD and the impact of anemia-targeting therapeutics on FGF23 elevation in CKD. RECENT FINDINGS: The anemia of CKD is primarily driven by a lack of erythropoietin (EPO) and iron deficiency. In addition to EPO and iron replacement, novel drug classes to treat anemia have been approved or are in clinical development. A recent observational study provides supportive evidence for the hypothesis that FGF23 elevation in CKD mediates adverse effects of iron deficiency on the cardiovascular system in patients with CKD. Preclinical and clinical studies revealed that ferric citrate (FC), and hypoxia-induced factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) treatment may reduce elevated FGF23 levels in CKD, suggesting that correcting anemia in CKD could potentially lower FGF23 levels. However, as we describe, HIF-PHI have context-dependent effects. Moreover, whether a reduction in FGF23 will improve patient outcomes in patients with CKD remains to be determined.

Given the challenges with the treatment options for patients with cardiorenal anemia syndrome (CRSA), new therapeutic agents such as hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors (HIF-PH) or hepcidin antagonists are emerging in the light of recent research. This review summarizes the potential therapeutic tools for anemia therapy in the cardiorenal population.","2023","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

It is accepted that people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop anaemia as their kidney function declines. METHODS: To better understand IDA in CKD, it is necessary to appreciate the normal iron metabolism and utilisation of iron and how these processes can be disordered in patients with CKD. The problems related to infection / inflammation and oxidative stress are examined. Whilst National and international guidelines recommend specific tests for IDA, these and alternative tests are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst iron supplementation is necessary for CKD patients with IDA, iron metabolism and utilisation can be affected by factors such as infection or inflammation. Iron is essential element for all life, it can be toxic to cells through the process of oxidative stress. The recommended tests for IDA may be affected by factors such as infection and inflammation. Alternative tests are available, which may be a more accurate indicator of IDA as they are not affected by external factors.","2013","Journal of renal care",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials have demonstrated that HIF stabilizers effectively increase hemoglobin levels of both nondialysis and dialysis CKD patients without causing serious adverse effects. HIF stabilizers not only restore EPO production but also optimize iron metabolism by reducing hepcidin levels. Considering the pleiotropic roles of the PHD-HIF pathway, HIF stabilizers might have both advantageous and disadvantageous effects in humans, in addition to erythropoiesis. Results of studies in animal models have suggested that HIF stabilizers alleviate ischemia-reperfusion injury and play protective roles against metabolic diseases. In contrast, a theoretical concern exists regarding the potential for tumorigenesis due to HIF stabilization. SUMMARY: At least five HIF stabilizers are now in phase III trials and may appear on the market in 1-2 years.

In these patients, intravenous iron reduces ESA dose requirements and increases the likelihood of maintaining levels of hemoglobin within the desired range. Oral iron is inferior to intravenous iron in patients on hemodialysis, in part because elevated serum levels of hepcidin prevent intestinal absorption of iron. Increased levels of hepcidin also impair the normal recycling of iron through the reticuloendothelial system. Levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation below 450 pmol/l and 20%, respectively are indicative of iron deficiency, but values above the normal range lack diagnostic value in patients with CKD on dialysis.

","Oriot P. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Assessment of glucose exposure via glycated hemoglobin A(1)c (HbA(1)c) has limitations for interpretation in individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The glucose management indicator (GMI) derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data could be an alternative. However, the concordance between HbA(1)c measured in laboratory and GMI (HbA(1)c-GMI) is uncertain in individuals with CKD. The purpose of this study is to analyze this discrepancy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We performed a multicentric, retrospective, observational study. A group of individuals with diabetes and CKD (n = 170) was compared with a group of individuals with diabetes without CKD (n = 185). All individuals used an intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM). A comparison of 14-day and 90-day glucose data recorded by the isCGM was performed to calculate GMI and the discordance between lab HbA(1)c and GMI was analyzed by a Bland-Altman method and linear regression. RESULTS: HbA(1)c-GMI discordance was significantly higher in the CKD group versus without CKD group (0.78 ± 0.57 [0.66-0.90] vs 0.59 ± 0.44 [0.50-0.66]%, P < .005). An absolute difference >0.5% was found in 68.2% of individuals with CKD versus 42.2% of individuals without CKD. We suggest a new specific formula to estimate HbA(1)c from the linear regression between HbA(1)c and mean glucose CGM, namely CKD-GMI = 0.0261 × 90-day mean glucose (mg/L) + 3.5579 (r(2) = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c-GMI discordance is frequent and usually in favor of an HbA1c level higher than the GMI value, which can lead to errors in changes in glucose-lowering therapy, especially for individuals with CKD. This latter population should benefit from the CGM to measure their glucose exposure more precisely.","2023","Journal of diabetes science and technology"," The purpose of this study is to analyze this discrepancy ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Intravenous iron is more effective and can raise levels of hemoglobin even without the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Unfortunately, the current assays of iron status that are presently widely available are not especially helpful in predicting response. In patients on dialysis, i.v. iron is effective over a wide range of serum ferritin from <100 ng/ml to 800 ng/ml. None of the three available randomized controlled trials comparing oral with i.v. iron showed evidence of nephrotoxicity caused by i.v. iron. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for thrombocytosis and should, wherever possible, be avoided. Optimal coadministration of iron may reduce the risk for ESA-driven cardiovascular events. Increased total body iron stores (imperfectly reflected by serum ferritin levels in CKD) do not appear to be related to such events or hospitalization in CKD; it is unclear what other risk factors and mechanisms need to be considered. In the appreciable proportion of patients with both renal and cardiac dysfunction, management is further complicated by a vicious circle (which can be characterized as cardiorenal anemia syndrome) in which CKD, heart failure, and anemia exacerbate each other.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed in December 2011 and updated in February 2012 for any new trials. Randomized trials designed to evaluate effects of high (generally the Hb about 13.0 g/dL) and low Hb (generally the Hb about 10.0 g/dL) targets on clinical outcomes in CKD patients with anemia were collected. All statistical analysis was calculated using the RevMan software available free from the Cochrane Collaboration. 24 trials involving 10361 patients were identified. Our findings demonstrated a statistically significant increased risk of mortality in the high Hb levels (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37) while the high and low Hb groups were both treated with ESAs. Overall, compared with low Hb levels, high Hb levels are associated with increased risk of hypertension (RR 1.40; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.75), stroke (RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.29), and hospitalizations (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14).

Higher doses of ESAs have been demonstrated to result in a higher risk for cardiovascular disease due to elevated blood pressure or increased thrombogenicity. In addition, a high dose of iron might enhance inflammatory responses to infection and impair the phagocytic function of neutrophils. Moreover, iron induces the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which accelerate atherosclerosis. Patients with hyporesponsiveness to ESAs or dysutilization of iron for erythropoiesis tend to be treated with ESAs or iron at doses exceeding the physiological level. However, the optimal doses of ESAs and iron for maintaining target Hb levels in these patients are not well established.

","Ansari I. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has adverse consequences on almost all body systems. The kidney does not function merely as an excretory organ, but participates in normal erythropoiesis, normal bone mineral deposition and blood pressure regulation. REVIEW: Anemia is prevalent in CKD with known deleterious effects on the car diovascular system. It is mostly due to erythropoietin deficiency, inhibition of erythropoiesis by uremic solutes, and reduction in red blood cell life span. Other possible causes include iron, B12 or folic acid deficiency or blood loss. Dysfunction of the endogenous erythropoietin is usually clinically evident once the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 20-25 ml/min. Treating anemia of CKD is based on correction of iron deficiency and replacement of decreased erythropoietin production by erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). Guidelines recommend targeting hemoglobin levels of no more than 10-12 g/dl since there is evidence of increased mortality and morbidity in patients with higher levels. Increased level of pro-coagulant biomarkers cause enhanced thrombotic activity in CKD patients which promotes ischemic cardiac events while platelet dysfunction leads to bleeding diathesis. If anticoagulation is indicated, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) offer certain advantage sbut the dosage needs to be adjusted with increasing grade of renal insufficiency. Antiplatelet agents are effective in averting shunt and catheter thrombosis, but not for avoiding the thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts.

Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitors are currently being developed and approved in some countries as a new treatment for CKD patients with anemia due to the stabilization of intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α and HIF2α by PHD inhibition. Daprodustat is one of the orally administrated small-molecule HIF-PH inhibitors, leading to an increase in erythropoietin production, which is regulated by HIF. Also, daprodustat is expected to improve iron metabolism. Recently, several clinical trials showed its efficacy and safety in both hemodialysis- and non-hemodialysis- dependent CKD patients. In addition, some international Phase 3 studies are underway to confirm these effects and reveal the safety profile.

","Iseki K. and Kohagura K.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important and leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and moreover, plays a role in the morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, infection, and cancer. Anemia develops during the early stages of CKD and is common in patients with ESRD. Anemia is an important cause of left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure. Correction of anemia by erthyropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) has been shown to improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure. Anemia is counted as one of the non-conventional risk factors associated with CKD. Hypoxia is one of the common mechanisms of CKD progression. Treatment by ESA is expected to improve quality of life, survival, and prevent the CKD progression. Several clinical studies have shown the beneficial effects of anemia correction on renal outcomes. However, recent prospective trials both in ESRD and in CKD stages 3 and 4 failed to confirm the beneficial effects of correcting anemia on survival. Similarly, treatment of other risk factors such as hyperlipidemia by statin showed no improvement in the survival of dialysis patients. Given the high prevalence of anemia in ESRD and untoward effects of anemia in CKD stages 3 and 4, appropriate and timely intervention on renal anemia using ESA is required for practicing nephrologists and others involved in the care of high-risk population. Lessons from the recent studies are to correct renal anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dl not hemoglobin > or =13 g/dl). Early intervention for renal anemia is a part of the treatment option in the prevention clinic.

In this review, we evaluate the latest research on anemia management in chronic kidney disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents indicate that targeting the complete correction of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease results in a greater risk of morbidity and mortality despite improved hemoglobin and quality of life. Conversely, intravenous iron has been found effective and relatively well tolerated in treating anemia in chronic kidney disease, even in patients with elevated ferritin. New agents to manage anemia, including long-acting erythropoietin derivatives, are also in active development.

RECENT FINDINGS: ESA treatment to higher hemoglobin targets is now more clearly associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events. The mechanisms are unclear, but treatment has become somewhat more conservative as a result. New ESA drugs in development include methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator) and hematide, an erythropoietin mimetic. The Dialysis patients' Response to I.V. iron with Elevated ferritin (DRIVE) series of studies have provided important new information about i.v. iron treatment when serum ferritin is more than 500 ng/ml. Ferumoxytol, a new i.v. iron drug, has interesting properties that may improve the convenience of i.v. iron treatment.

In this editorial we review the clinical data that contribute to this controversy and the physiologic concepts underlying the treatment of anemia. Furthermore, we discuss the need to individualize hemoglobin targets for specific patient populations and the importance of early identification and treatment of anemia in patients with kidney disease. The economic impact of normalizing hemoglobin with the use of erythropoietin and intravenous or oral iron has affected clinical practice over the last decade. Current guidelines published by Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (KDOQI), the European Working Group on Anemia Management, and the Canadian Society of Nephrology all recommend target hemoglobin concentrations and thresholds for initiation of therapy and also suggest the need for reevaluation of current targets in light of new evidence. This editorial supports those guidelines and challenges the reader to critically evaluate current practice in the context of the accumulating data and the physiologic principles discussed herein. The therapy of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly sophisticated and is an essential component of care in patients with CKD. However, the effects of therapy will be most impressive when accompanied by the optimal care of all hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities that are associated with CKD.","2002","Seminars in dialysis"," In this editorial we review the clinical data that contribute to this controversy and the physiologic concepts underlying the treatment of anemia ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kalantar-Zadeh K. and Aronoff G.","Hemoglobin levels in individuals with chronic kidney disease fluctuate frequently above or below the recommended target levels within short periods of time even though the calculated mean hemoglobin remains within the target range of 11 to 12 g/dl. Both pharmacologic features and dosing of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may lead to cyclic pattern of hemoglobin levels within the recommended range. Several longitudinal studies highlight the complexity of maintaining stable hemoglobin levels over time. As a consequence, patients may risk increased hospitalization and mortality, because both low and high hemoglobin levels are associated with increased cardiovascular events and death. The duration of time that hemoglobin remains higher or lower than the target thresholds may be important to adverse outcomes. It is not clear whether adverse effects of hemoglobin variability are because of the therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and/or iron or despite such a therapy. Several factors affect hemoglobin variability, including those that are drug related, such as pharmacokinetic parameters, patient-related differences in demographic characteristics, and factors affecting clinical status, as well as clinical practice guidelines, treatment protocols, and reimbursement policies.

METHODS: We conducted qualitative concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive debriefing (CD) interviews to assess the frequency, duration, and severity of symptoms and impacts associated with anemia of CKD and to facilitate the development of a new patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure. We interviewed 36 patients with CKD and hemoglobin levels ≥8.0 to <12.0 g/dL using a semi-structured interview guide developed specifically for this study until saturation was reached. We used MAXQDA to perform qualitative analysis of interview transcripts to determine the most relevant symptoms and impacts (based on the frequency of concept mentions) experienced by participants. RESULTS: Most participants had stage 4/5 CKD (81%) and were being treated with an erythropoietin stimulating agent (69%). Spontaneously reported symptoms included feeling tired (79%), shortness of breath (39%), and weak/lacking strength (36%). We developed the Chronic Kidney Disease and Anemia Questionnaire (CKD-AQ), which includes 23 items assessing frequency and severity of the most relevant symptoms and impacts identified by patients with anemia of CKD. The CD interviews confirmed the clarity and relevance of the concepts identified in the CE phase. CONCLUSION: The CKD-AQ is a novel PRO measure that captures the frequency and severity of the most relevant symptoms and impacts associated with anemia of CKD.

Hyperkalemia is defined by a plasma level above 5.0 mmol/L, after ruling out pre-analytical problems such as hemolysis. It is frequent in CKD, most often due to drugs and notably renin/ angiotensin blockers. Chronic hyperkalemia is deleterious, with an increased risk of mortality. Therapeutic strategies to decrease the incidence and severity of hyperkalemia are therefore crucial in nephrology: experts recommend to maintain the renin/angiotensin blockers as long as possible, whilst associating diuretics and potassium binders. There are apparent discrepancies between optimal protein intake and decreased phosphate intake in CKD; this is even more important in dialysis since protein decrease is associated with denutrition and subsequent increased risk of mortality. Nutritional phosphate intake from vegetables are less absorbed; in contrast, phosphate additives are almost completely absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract. These ""hidden"" intake may increase the total daily phosphate intake by 1 000 mg. As such in addition to optimized dialysis, phosphate binders should be used but compliance may be challenging on the long-term.

","Rossert J. and Froissart M.","Anemia is a well-known consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and its prevalence progressively increases when the estimated glomerular filtration rate decreases to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, analyses of the consequences of anemia and of the mechanisms of progression of CKD suggest that anemia also could contribute to the deterioration of kidney function. This hypothesis is based mostly on experimental data that imply that hypoxia of tubular cells plays an important role in tubulointerstitial damage associated with CKD and, thus, in the progression of renal failure. It also is supported by the fact that red blood cells represent a major antioxidant component of blood and that oxidative stress appears to contribute to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage. In humans, post hoc analysis of the Reduction of End points in non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan study and analyses of smaller prospective cohorts of CKD patients have shown that anemia is an independent risk factor for progression of CKD. In addition, 3 small randomized studies have suggested that anemia correction could slow the progression of CKD. Thus, the existence of a relationship between anemia and progression of CKD is not only plausible biologically, but also is supported by observational studies and by small intervention studies. However, only a large, randomized, prospective trial will be able to establish if anemia correction can slow the progression of CKD effectively.","2006","Seminars in nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

RESULTS: Anemia was more frequent in the diabetic CKD patients group (52.4%, p < 0.001). Anemia prevalence was also higher in all CKD patients as well as in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic ones. Iron deficiency was more frequent in diabetic patients. Among CKD diabetic patients the prevalence of iron deficiency was higher than in non-diabetic CKD ones. Diminished iron availability prevalence was higher in non-diabetic patients.

However, in the general population, the mean Hb levels differ by sex and age. Furthermore, the comorbidities and activities of daily living of elderly patients are markedly different from those of nonelderly patients. CKD in elderly patients is accompanied by not only chronic inflammation, which is more severe than that in nonelderly patients, but also changes in the secretion of sex hormones with aging and decreases in erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. Thus, it is presumed that compared with nonelderly CKD patients, elderly CKD patients are hyporesponsive to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and show the dysutilization of iron for erythropoiesis. However, in these patients, the target Hb levels and the appropriate doses of ESA and iron preparations are not indicated clearly. Recent clinical trials have reported that higher Hb levels, the same as those in nonelderly CKD patients, might not necessarily improve the quality of life or survival of elderly CKD patients. We have also revealed that hyporesponsiveness to ESAs and higher doses of intravenous iron affect the adverse events occurring in elderly patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis compared with nonelderly CKD patients.

","Vaziri N.","Observational studies have shown a strong positive correlation between the severity of anemia and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This observation was initially taken to imply that adverse outcomes in CKD are caused by anemia. However, the assumption of causality ignores the possibility that anemia and adverse outcomes might be unrelated and that both are caused by underlying inflammation, oxidative stress and comorbid conditions. Randomized clinical trials of anemia correction have revealed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients assigned to normal, rather than subnormal, hemoglobin targets. As a result, correction of anemia is now considered potentially hazardous in patients with CKD. Notably, individuals who did not reach the target hemoglobin level in the clinical trials, despite receiving high doses of erythropoietin and iron, experienced a disproportionately large share of the adverse outcomes. These observations point to overdose of erythropoietin and iron, rather than anemia correction per se, as the likely culprit. This Review explores the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the findings of observational studies and randomized clinical trials of anemia treatment in CKD. I have focused on data from basic and translational studies, which are often overlooked in the design and interpretation of clinical studies and in the formulation of clinical guidelines.","2008","Nature clinical practice.

Use of erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESA) in chronic kidney disease patients with anemia is similarly based on strong observational data indicating that the degree of anemia is independently associated with higher risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In non-dialysis patients with mild to moderate anemia, current clinical outcome studies have only addressed arbitrary hemoglobin targets for ESA therapy and have shown that targeting the higher hemoglobin levels was not associated with the benefit and may even result in harm.

METHODS: Electronic healthcare records and medical claims data of pre-dialysis CKD patients were aggregated from a large US managed care provider (2011-13). ESA use patterns, characteristics, and outcomes of ESA-treated/untreated patients were quantified. RESULTS: At baseline, 109/32,308 patients (0.3%) were ESA users. Treated patients were older, had more advanced CKD (58.8% vs 5.4% with stage 4/5 vs 3) and greater prevalence of comorbid diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. An additional 266 patients initiated ESA: hemoglobin at initiation was 8-10 g/dL in 193 of these and >10 g/dL in the remainder; 61.7% had stage 4/5 CKD; prevalence of cardiovascular disease was high (50.8% heart failure; 25.2% prior myocardial infarction; 24.1% prior stroke).

Therefore, high levels of serum ferritin in patients on MHD can be used to indicate iron deposition in most cells, including vascular and immunocompetent cells, and is still a reliable indicator of the need to withhold iron administration.","2010","American journal of nephrology",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Nakanishi T. et al.","BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) could be multifactorial. In recent animal studies, hepcidin knockout (KO) mice with adenine-induced CKD did not exhibit anemia and iron deﬁciency. Hepcidin has emerged as a major player in the development of anemia in CKD. We suspected that erythropoietin (EPO) deﬁciency may not be the mainstay of anemia in CKD, although relative EPO deﬁciency could contribute to the failure to increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Some factors may interfere with the differentiation of erythroids. SUMMARY: Based on previous flow cytometric analysis, the differentiation and maturation of bone marrow erythroid precursors were compared between 2 mouse models of anemia, namely, EPO-KO mice and adenine-induced CKD mice. EPO-KO mice exhibited greater than 50% reduction in the CD71-low/Ter119-high population, which represents a mature erythroid stage in the bone marrow. In contrast, these mice exhibited no reduction in the CD71-high/Ter119-low and CD71-high/Ter119-high cell populations, which represent an early erythroid stage. However, in CKD mice, the percentages of CD71-high/Ter119-low and CD71-high/Ter119-high erythroid cells, which correspond to proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts, respectively, were decreased in bone marrow. Thus, the CKD mice exhibited a decrease in the number of cells expressing transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) or early stage erythroblasts, which was completely different from the results obtained for EPO-KO mice. Thus, in CKD, decreased expression of TfR1 in erythroblasts as well as increased hepcidin levels in circulation may hamper erythroblast differentiation by decreasing the iron supply, as iron is an indispensable component of erythroblast differentiation. We conclude that deregulated iron metabolism could be the principal cause of anemia in CKD, impeding the differentiation of erythroblasts. We propose that the ""hepcidin-anemia axis"" is involved in the pathogenesis of CKD-associated anemia. For the treatment of anemia in CKD, declining hepcidin levels are essential for efficient erythropoiesis. Key Messages: These findings have led us to target the hepcidin-anemia axis as a new treatment strategy for anemia in CKD, including via newly developed erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and hypoxia inducible factor stabilizers.","2019","Contributions to nephrology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

In order to circumvent costly recombinant DNA technology, synthetic chemistry techniques were used to manufacture peginesatide, a synthetic peptide that bore no resemblance to previous erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and yet was capable of stimulating erythropoiesis. Compared with other ESAs, peginesatide was deemed to have advantages related to immunogenicity, administration schedule, and cost. Marketing approval was restricted to CKD patients on dialysis because cardiovascular events were more common with peginesatide than with darbepoetin in non-dialysis CKD patients. Unfortunately, unexplained serious adverse drug reactions (sADR) led to quick withdrawal of peginesatide from the market. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the efficacy and safety of peginesatide in pre-approval clinical trials, sADRs after marketing approval, and lessons learned during its short life-span. EXPERT OPINION: The case of peginesatide illustrates the difficulties in detecting rare sADRs in trials with limited patient populations and the need for improved pharmacovigilance after marketing approval. However, the need for simpler drug production methods as a result of non-dependence on recombinant DNA techniques and mammalian cell lines remains.

","Paganini E.","The development of hypoproliferative anemia with generally normocytic red blood cells in most patients with chronic renal failure impairs the success of maintenance dialysis therapy, particularly hemodialysis. Anemia can be a complication of the hemodialysis procedure itself, with its associated blood losses and mild effect on oxygen transport functioning. However, the primary cause of anemia in the chronic dialysis patient is decreased erythropoiesis. The most important mechanism leading to decreased erythropoiesis involves the production of subnormal levels of erythropoietin (EPO). Insufficient nephric output of EPO or, possibly, suppression of the effect of EPO by uremic inhibitors may cause this decreased erythropoiesis. Other factors, such as iron deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, systemic infections, and aluminum toxicity may contribute to anemia in some patients. Increased hemolysis, a comparatively mild factor in the anemia of chronic dialysis patients, may be related to retention of protein metabolism products, hypersplenism, hypophosphatemia, drugs, or other conditions in affected patients. There are several traditional treatment options for anemia: transfusions; iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid supplementation when indicated; a change to peritoneal dialysis; parathyroidectomy; and administration of androgens. None of these treatments have proved satisfactory, and some, such as transfusions and androgen therapy, pose risks and have serious side effects. A comparatively new approach, administration of genetically engineered erythropoietin (r-HuEPO; EPOGEN, AMGEN inc, Thousand Oaks, CA), has been found effective in treating anemia in clinical trials. Patients have shown improved cardiac performance as well as enhanced quality of life, and hypertension appears to be the most serious side effect of r-HuEPO therapy.","1989","Seminars in nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Objective: To assess the prevalence and correlations of anemia, iron deficiency and overhydration in patients with stage 2 to 5 CKD. Methods and Results: This cross-sectional study enrolled 125 erythropoietin and iron therapy naïve non-dialysis CKD patients, without a identifiable cause of anemia. Parameters of hematological, iron, inflammatory and nutritional status were measured. The overhydration parameter (OH) assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy was used to characterize hydration status. The prevalence of decreased hemoglobin (Hb) <110g/L increased along CKD stages from 0% to 40% (p=0.008). Fluid overload (OH >1L) and lower serum albumin (<40g/L) were more common in stage 5 versus stage 3 CKD (53% vs. 10%, p<0.001, and 27% vs. 3%, p=0.02, respectively), suggesting a potential dilutional reduction in serum proteins. Conversely, decreased iron stores (ferritin <100mcg/L) and iron availability (transferrin saturation, TSAT<0.20) were similarly prevalent irrespective of kidney function decline. Hemoglobin was positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum albumin, and transferrin saturation, but inversely with OH. However, in a model of multiple linear regression which explained 32% of hemoglobin variation, only eGFR and overhydration remained the independent predictors of anemia. Discussion: As fluid overload is a common denominator for hemoglobin and TSAT levels, and is closely related to the declining kidney function, it should be considered in the management of renal anemia, at least in advanced CKD.","2018","Journal of medicine and life"," Objective : To assess the prevalence and correlations of anemia , iron deficiency and overhydration in patients with stage 2 to 5 CKD ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

,"24175256"," Hepcidin and HFE protein: Iron metabolism as a target for the anemia of chronic kidney disease. ","Canavesi E. et al.","The anemia of chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis is characterized by chronic inflammation and release of cytokines, resulting in the upregulation of the iron hormone hepcidin, also increased by iron therapy and reduced glomerular filtration, with consequent reduction in iron absorption, recycling, and availability to the erythron. This response proves advantageous in the short-term to restrain iron availability to pathogens, but ultimately leads to severe anemia, and impairs the response to erythropoietin (Epo) and iron. Homozygosity for the common C282Y and H63D HFE polymorphisms influence iron metabolism by hampering hepcidin release by hepatocytes in response to increased iron stores, thereby resulting in inadequate inhibition of the activity of Ferroportin-1, inappropriately high iron absorption and recycling, and iron overload. However, in hemodialysis patients, carriage of HFE mutations may confer an adaptive benefit by decreasing hepcidin release in response to iron infusion and inflammation, thereby improving iron availability to erythropoiesis, anemia control, the response to Epo, and possibly survival. Therefore, anti-hepcidin therapies may improve anemia management in hemodialysis. However, HFE mutations directly favor hemoglobinization independently of hepcidin, and reduce macrophages activation in response to inflammation, whereas hepcidin might also play a beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-microbic action during sepsis, so that direct inhibition of HFE-mediated regulation of iron metabolism may represent a valuable alternative therapeutic target. Genetic studies may offer a valuable tool to test these hypotheses and guide the research of new therapies.","2012","World journal of nephrology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Perfluorocarbons are potent oxygen transporters used in organ preservation and synthetic blood development. Data are scarce on their relationship with kidney function, especially in diabetes where anemia and hypoxia are more prevalent. We investigated the relationship of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAS) with kidney function and variation by diabetes and anemia status. METHODS: Data on 53,650 adults (5,210 with diabetes) were obtained from the C8 Health Project. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Four PFAS were investigated: perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and perfluorononanoic acid. FINDINGS: Each PFAS was positively associated with eGFR among those with CKD or anemia; this was the strongest among those with both CKD and anemia, followed by those with CKD uncomplicated by anemia. These relationships were more pronounced among those with diabetes (all P<0.01). In the absence of both CKD and anemia, PFAS was inversely associated with eGFR. Among persons with both anemia and diabetes, when further stratified by CKD stage, compared to an eGFR <30, ORs (95% CI) for being in the eGFR ≥ 90, 60-89, 45-59, and 30-45 range, respectively, were 3.20 (2.00-5.13), 2.64 (1.83-3.80), 3.18 (2.17-4.67), and 1.99 (1.38-2.86) for each ng/dL increase in PFHxS.

A total of 182 active compounds were identified in NDQ granules, and 397 putative targets associated with different diseases were derived through ADME modelling and target prediction tools. Protein-protein interaction networks of CKD-related and putative NDQ targets were constructed, and 219 candidate targets were identified based on topological features. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the candidate targets were mostly related to the TGF-β, the p38MAPK, and the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor signaling pathways, which are known contributors to renal fibrosis and/or renal anemia. A rat model of CKD was established to validate the drug-target mechanisms predicted by the systems pharmacology analysis. Experimental results confirmed that NDQ granules exerted therapeutic effects on CKD and its comorbidities, including renal anemia, mainly by modulating the TGF-β and EPO signaling pathways.

Certain symptoms previously attributed to CKD are now known to be a consequence of anemia. Anemia contributes to an increased cardiac output, and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, angina and congestive heart failure, leading to high morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. The multifunctional α-klotho (KL) protein, which is predominantly expressed in the kidneys, is associated with the occurrence of anemia in patients with CKD. The present review presents current evidence on the potential role of α-KL in renal anemia. Low expression of α-KL appears to improve anemia in patients with CKD, and has been hypothesized to be a compensatory mechanism to attenuate the effects of anemia in patients with CKD. Further understanding of the role of α-KL in renal anemia may offer novel insights into the treatment of patients with CKD complicated with anemia.","2017","Experimental and therapeutic medicine",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

In studies of physiological responses to other erythropoietic stimuli, erythropoietin induced erythroblast secretion of erythroferrone (ERFE), which acts on the liver to suppress hepcidin production and mobilize iron for erythropoiesis. We therefore investigated whether vadadustat effects on erythropoiesis and iron metabolism are dependent on ERFE. Wild type and ERFE knockout mice with and without CKD were treated with vadadustat or vehicle. In both wild type and ERFE knockout CKD models, vadadustat was similarly effective, as evidenced by normalized hemoglobin concentrations, increased expression of duodenal iron transporters, lower serum hepcidin levels, and decreased tissue iron concentrations. This is consistent with ERFE-independent increased iron mobilization. Vadadustat treatment also lowered serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations and decreased expression of kidney fibrosis markers. Lastly, vadadustat affected fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) profiles: in non-CKD mice, vadadustat increased plasma total FGF23 out of proportion to intact FGF23, consistent with the known effects of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and erythropoietin on FGF23 production and metabolism. However, in the mice with CKD, vadadustat markedly decreased both total and intact FGF23, effects likely contributed to by the reduced loss of kidney function. Thus, in this CKD model, vadadustat ameliorated anemia independently of ERFE, improved kidney parameters, and decreased FGF23.

High-precision Fe isotopic analysis of blood serum samples of CKD patients with and without ID/anemia was performed via multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) for such a purpose. Patients with CKD and/or iron disorders showed a heavier serum Fe isotopic composition than controls. Many clinical parameters used for the diagnosis and follow-up of anemia correlated significantly with the serum Fe isotopic composition. In contrast, no relation was observed between the serum Fe isotopic composition and the estimated glomerular filtration rate as a measure of kidney function. Among the CKD patients, the serum Fe isotopic composition was substantially heavier in the occurrence of ID anemia, while erythropoietin-related anemia did not exert this effect.

Hgb levels and kidney functions were analyzed on the same day as CGA measurements. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to detect the optimum level of Hgb according to the best performance of CGA parameters. RESULTS: 622 elderly CKD patients (69.3% female, 55.7% with anemia) were included. After adjustment for confounders, those with anemia had dynapenia (OR 1.60), high risk of falls (OR 1.60), and decreased functional capacity (OR 1.83) among females and those with anemia had dynapenia (OR 4.31), a high risk of falling (OR 2.42) and decreased functional capacity (OR 2.94) among males.

It is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease. During chronic kidney disease, iron deficiency is defined by a transferrin saturation <20% and/or a serum ferritin <100 μg/L. In France, about half of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients have absolute iron deficiency (transferrin saturation <20% and serum ferritin <100 μg/L) and/or functional iron deficiency (transferrin saturation <20% and serum ferritin >100 μg/L). Despite this, iron deficiency is usually not investigated. In fact, more than 60% of nephrologists do not assess iron status at least once a year. In addition, iron deficiency is rarely treated: only 12% of patients are prescribed oral or intravenous iron. Early detection and treatment are fundamental and should be systematic. In order to help improve the management of iron deficiency among non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients, we propose an algorithm that takes into account current recommendations and the most recent data from the literature. Initial blood test requires the measurement of hemoglobin concentration, transferrin saturation and serum ferritin. A transferrin saturation <20% establishes the diagnosis of iron deficiency and the serum ferritin level points towards an absolute or functional deficiency. The combination of both values makes it possible to adapt the treatment, particularly in an inflammatory context where oral iron is not effective.","2022","Nephrologie & therapeutique",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on chronic kidney disease patients at a tertiary care center. Demographic data like age, sex, height and weight were collected with the help of using Performa. The hematological and biochemical study variables were assayed by blood sample of the patients in the clinical laboratory services. Data were analyzed by statistical package for the social sciences Version 20.0 Results: Out of 171 patients with chronic kidney disease, 162 (94.7%) were anemic, with the highest percentage 54 (31.5%) having hypertension. The median value with inter-quartile range of hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, TIBC and transferring saturation were 8.9 gm/dl (6.7-10.0), 115.0 (µg/dl) (60.0-140.0), 599.0 ng/ml (142.6-973.0), 279.0 µg/dl (250.0-342.0) and 41.0 % (22.0-53.0) respectively. Serum creatinine and eGFR were significantly correlated with hemoglobin and iron indices.

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study on 770 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) attending a diabetes centre in 2002-2017. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify HbA1c trajectories. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine association between the trajectories and CKD progression which was defined as deterioration across the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes estimated glomerular filtration rate categories with ≥25% drop from baseline. RESULTS: We identified four HbA1c trajectories: 'near-optimal stable' (49.1%), 'moderate stable' (37.9%), 'moderate-increasing' (6.0%) and 'high-decreasing' (7.0%). Over a median follow-up period of 4.6 years (interquartile range 2.5-5.6), CKD progression occurred in 35.6% of patients. The risk of CKD progression was significantly higher in the moderate-increasing with adjusted hazard ratios (HR) 2.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-4.57). After additional adjustment for mean HbA1c, the association between the moderate-increasing subgroup and CKD progression remained significant at HR 3.07 (95% CI 1.08-8.77).

,"11726002"," Considerations for optimal iron use for anemia due to chronic kidney disease. ","Hudson J. and Comstock T.","BACKGROUND: Availability of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has improved the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron deficiency is the most common cause of resistance to rHuEPO therapy, contributing to ineffective erythropoiesis and hematocrit/hemoglobin values below the recommended target range (33%-36%/11-12 g/dL). I.v. iron supplementation is necessary to meet increased iron demands from stimulation of erythropoiesis and chronic blood loss; however, questions remain as to the optimal supplementation strategy to maintain appropriate yet safe iron status. Treatment guidelines for anemia management have been developed through the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI). OBJECTIVE: This review presents the basis of need for the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines and includes detailed information concerning iron physiology, metabolism, iron preparations, and evaluation of iron status. METHODS: This review was based on a MEDLINE search and complemented by references from the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines (whose review extended beyond MEDLINE). References focusing on normal iron physiology and metabolism, alterations in iron physiology in patients with CKD, laboratory evaluation methods, and strategies for iron supplementation were obtained from MEDLINE and reviewed for content. RESULTS: Controversy over appropriate use of iron supplementation has led to disparity in accepted practice procedures. Oral iron (ferrous salts and polysaccharide iron complex) and i.v. iron preparations (iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, and iron sucrose) are available. Problems with oral iron supplementation include limited absorption and patient noncompliance. Although most available data on i.v. iron use in the United States are specific to iron dextran preparations, published information based on clinical use of sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose products has been promising. The use of chronic i.v. iron administration to sustain iron stores has been more widely accepted to prevent development of absolute and functional iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Although iron therapy is commonly warranted in patients with CKD, questions remain as to the most favorable supplementation strategy to optimize therapy through improvements in hematocrits, efficient use of rHuEPO, and maintenance of appropriate and safe iron levels. Clinicians will need to devise strategies based on the compilation of information from clinical experience and the available literature.

","Majoni S. et al.","Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians (Indigenous Australians) suffer some of the highest rates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the world. Among Indigenous Australians in remote areas of the Northern Territory, prevalence rates for renal replacement therapy (RRT) are up to 30 times higher than national prevalence. Anemia among patients with CKD is a common complication. Iron deficiency is one of the major causes. Iron deficiency is also one of the key causes of poor response to the mainstay of anemia therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Therefore, the effective management of anemia in people with CKD is largely dependent on effective identification and correction of iron deficiency. The current identification of iron deficiency in routine clinical practice is dependent on 2 surrogate markers of iron status: serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation (TSAT). However, questions exist regarding the use of serum ferritin concentration in people with CKD because it is an acute-phase reactant that can be raised in the context of acute and chronic inflammation. Serum ferritin concentration among Indigenous Australians receiving RRT is often markedly elevated and falls outside reference ranges within most national and international guidelines for iron therapy for people with CKD.

The findings also underscore the importance of maintaining a stable hemoglobin concentration within the target range to reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity. BACKGROUND: Anemia management in patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD has attracted attention with the introduction of novel therapeutic agents; however, few studies have provided comprehensive epidemiologic information. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in adult patients with stage ≥3a nondialysis-dependent CKD and hemoglobin (Hb) <11 g/dl (January 2013–November 2021; N=26,626) to assess longitudinal treatment patterns, Hb, and iron parameters (ferritin and transferrin saturation) for anemia management. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess the risk of clinical events, including death, cardiovascular events, dialysis introduction, and red blood cell transfusion, associated with temporal fluctuation patterns of Hb levels. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of anemia treatment initiation within 12 months was 37.1%, including erythropoiesis-stimulating agents 26.5%, iron oral 16.8%, iron intravenous 5.1%, and hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor 0.2%. The mean (±SD) Hb levels were improved from 9.9±1.2 to 10.9±1.6 g/dl at 12 months. Despite erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor therapy, 30.1% of patients remained Hb <10 g/dl. The risks of premature death, cardiovascular events, dialysis introduction, and red blood cell transfusion were significantly higher in groups with consistently low Hb or low-amplitude Hb fluctuation around the lower limit of target Hb range than in patients with target Hb range (P < 0.05). Similarly, significantly higher risks for dialysis introduction and red blood cell transfusion were associated with high-amplitude Hb fluctuation across target Hb range were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the importance of stable Hb control within the target range to reduce the mortality and morbidity risks in patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD while highlighting the suboptimal and heterogeneous treatment of anemia in clinical practice.","2023","Kidney360",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study in three different nephrology clinics. Adult (>18 years of age) chronic kidney disease patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min, and who were not started dialysis were recruited. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data regarding anemia and its management were collected using a standard data form.

In this study, we explored the most cost-effective Hb target for anemia treatment in persons with CKD stages 3-4. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The CKD Health Policy Model was populated with a synthetic cohort of persons over age 30 with prevalent CKD stages 3-4 (i.e., not on dialysis) and anemia created from the 1999-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), computed as incremental cost divided by incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs), were assessed for Hb targets of 10 g/dl to 13 g/dl at 0.5 g/dl increments. Targeting a Hb of 10 g/dl resulted in an ICER of $32,111 compared with no treatment and targeting a Hb of 10.5 g/dl resulted in an ICER of $32,475 compared with a Hb target of 10 g/dl. QALYs increased to 4.63 for a Hb target of 10 g/dl and to 4.75 for a target of 10.5 g/dl or 11 g/dl. Any treatment target above 11 g/dl increased medical costs and decreased QALYs.

","Kalantar-Zadeh K. et al.","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those requiring maintenance hemodialysis treatments, may lose up to 3 g of iron each year because of frequent blood losses. Higher doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may worsen iron depletion and lead to an increased platelet count (thrombocytosis), ESA hyporesponsiveness, and hemoglobin variability. Hence, ESA therapy requires concurrent iron supplementation. Traditional iron markers such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation ratio (TSAT) (ie, serum iron divided by total iron-binding capacity [TIBC]), may be confounded by non-iron-related conditions. Whereas serum ferritin <200 ng/mL suggests iron deficiency in CKD patients, ferritin levels between 200 and 1,200 ng/mL may be related to inflammation, latent infections, malignancies, or liver disease. Protein-energy wasting may lower TIBC, leading to a TSAT within the normal range, even when iron deficiency is present. Iron and anemia indices have different mortality predictabilities, in that high serum ferritin but low iron, TIBC, and TSAT levels are associated with increased mortality, whereas hemoglobin exhibits a U-shaped risk for death. The increased mortality associated with targeting hemoglobin above 13 g/dL may result from iron depletion-associated thrombocytosis. Intravenous (IV) iron administration may not only decrease hemoglobin variability and ESA hyporesponsiveness, it may also reduce the greater mortality associated with the much higher ESA doses that have been used in some patients when targeting higher hemoglobin levels.","2009","Advances in chronic kidney disease",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

SUMMARY: Although erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are the mainstay of anemia treatment, concomitant iron supplementation is often required. Patients with CKD are at risk for developing iron deficiency due to frequent blood testing, decreased dietary intake, inflammation, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, the use of phosphate binders, hemodialysis, and treatment with ESAs. Seven randomized, controlled trials compared i.v. and oral iron in this population, six in patients treated with ESAs and one in patients not receiving ESAs. Two studies found no difference between i.v. and oral iron. An additional study found the two formulations to be equivalent when evaluating ESA dosage requirements. All studies found i.v. iron to be superior in increasing ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. Five of the studies compared baseline laboratory values for patients treated with i.v. and oral iron; all of these found oral iron to significantly increase hemoglobin, ferritin, or TSAT levels. Only one trial found a significant decrease from baseline in ferritin and TSAT for oral iron. Interpretation of the results of these studies is limited by several factors, the most significant of which is a short study duration, ranging from 21 days to six months. CONCLUSION: Published evidence does not support the use of i.v. iron over oral iron to treat deficiencies in non-hemodialysis-dependent patients with CKD.

However, no consensus has been reached which cutoffs of these parameters should be applied to define iron deficiency. Hence, we aimed to assess prospectively which cutoffs of ferritin and TSAT performed optimally for outcomes in CKD patients. METHODS: We meticulously analyzed 975 CKD community dwelling patients of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease prospective study based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73m(2), albuminuria > 30 mg/24 h, or albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses using different sets and combinations of cutoffs of ferritin and TSAT were performed to assess prospective associations with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and development of anemia. RESULTS: Of the included 975 CKD patients (62 ± 12 years, 64% male with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 77 ± 23 ml/min/1.73m(2)), 173 CKD patients died during a median follow-up of 8.0 (interquartile range 7.5-8.7) years of which 70 from a cardiovascular cause.

CONCLUSION: In this study, we have shown that of the traditionally used markers of iron status, reduced TSAT, especially TSAT< 10%, is most strongly associated with the risk of adverse outcomes in CKD patients irrespective of serum ferritin level, suggesting that clinicians should focus more on TSAT rather than ferritin in this patient setting.

Doses were titrated to maintain hemoglobin levels between 10 g/dL and 12 g/dL during the 25 weeks of the study. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean hemoglobin values during the evaluation period (weeks 20 - 25). ♦ RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin value during the evaluation period was 11.3 ± 1.07 g/dL, and the mean change from baseline was 0.10 ± 1.15 g/dL (95% confidence limits: -0.24, 0.44 g/dL). During the evaluation period, most patients maintained hemoglobin levels between 10 g/dL and 12 g/dL (63.0%) and within ±1.0 g/dL of baseline (60.9%).

In this population CKD progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at quadruple the rate in Caucasians. Factors fueling progression to ESRD include diabetes and hypertension, which show high prevalences and accelerated renal damage in African- Americans, as well as possible nutritional, socioeconomic, and genetic factors. Anemia, a common and deleterious complication of CKD, is more prevalent and severe in African-American than Caucasian patients at each stage of the disease. Proactive management of diabetes, hypertension, anemia, and other complications throughout the course of CKD can prevent or delay disease progression and alleviate the burden of ESRD for the African-American community. Currently, African-Americans with CKD are less likely than Caucasian patients to receive anemia treatment before and after the onset of dialysis. Although African-Americans often require higher doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, this may result from late treatment initiation, lower hemoglobin levels, or the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and inflammation, although racial differences in response cannot be excluded.

After the introduction of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA's) the treatment of anemia in CKD has changed dramatically. Today, ESA's have a fundamental role in the increase of Hb values in CKD. Previously, severe anemia was frequent and blood transfusions were often necessary to improve patients quality of life. Small observational studies performed during the late 80's suggested that high Hb values may be benefic in CKD patients. At that time, the use of ESA's became universal. Later randomized trials tried to show the positive impact of rising Hb levels with ESA's in patient's outcome. The results of such studies were disappointing. Some of them even documented higher mortality associated with near normal Hb levels, failing to prove the real benefit of the complete correction of CKD anemia. We're still waiting for new randomized trials to be elucidated about the optimal target of Hb to achieve in CKD and the treatment algorithm with ESA's.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study subjects were divided into four groups. Group-A: HDCKD Patients receiving iv iron (n=290). Group-B: Patients not initiated on to hemodialysis (NDCKD), and received oral iron (n=38). Group-C: HDCKD patients with erythropoietin hypo responsiveness (n=9). Group-D: Healthy controls (n=36). The group-A, patients were sub-divided into five groups (A-1 to A-5) based on their serum ferritin levels. RESULTS: Serum ferritin and tissue iron levels in group-A and C patients were significantly greater than the group-D(p<0.0001) and group-B patients(p<0.001). Transferrin level of group-A and C showed lowered values and consequently a higher %TSAT when compared to group-D.

,"21063931"," Management of anemia and iron deficiency in heart failure. ","O'Meara E. and de D.","Anemia is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). The diagnosis of anemia should prompt assessment of the underlying cause(s), first by using routine laboratory measurements (i.e., serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, folic acid, and thyroid stimulating hormone). In clinical practice, it remains unclear whether using levels of the soluble transferrin receptor in HF patients to assess iron deficiency is warranted. Further investigation should follow these simple tests when judged appropriate (e.g., if occult gastrointestinal blood losses are suspected). Hemodilution may contribute significantly to anemia in patients with advanced HF and may be suspected when signs of hypervolemia are present. Euvolemia should be the first goal in such cases (as always), followed by optimization of the disease-modifying therapies used in HF (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, or aldosterone antagonists and cardiac resynchronization therapy in selected cases). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) can be used to improve functional capacity in patients with significant chronic kidney disease (CKD), a frequent comorbidity in HF patients. ESA and iron therapy is recommended in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), with a target hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL. In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, weekly administration of intravenous iron significantly improved symptoms, New York Heart Association class, quality of life, and exercise capacity in both anemic and non-anemic HF patients. A trend toward fewer hospitalizations was seen in the group treated with intravenous iron. The rates of adverse events were similar in the treatment and the placebo groups. Larger-scale and longer-term studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy profile of intravenous iron in non-CKD HF patients and in HF patients without anemia. Studies designed to further unravel the pathophysiology of anemia in HF are essential in order to determine 1) novel treatment targets and 2) whether and how the treatment of anemia could improve outcomes.","2010","Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

One factor that has generally been ignored in many of these people is the fact that they are often anemic. The anemia in CHF is due mainly to the frequently-associated CKD but also to the inhibitory effects of cytokines on erythropoietin production and on bone marrow activity, as well as to their interference with iron absorption from the gut and their inhibiting effect on the release of iron from iron stores. Anemia itself may further worsen cardiac and renal function and make the patients resistant to standard CHF therapy. Indeed anemia in CHF has been associated with increased severity of CHF, increased hospitalization, worse cardiac function and functional class, the need for higher doses of diuretics, progressive worsening of renal function and reduced QoL. In both controlled and uncontrolled studies of CHF, the correction of the anemia with erythropoietin (EPO) and oral or intravenous (IV) iron has been associated with improvement in many cardiac and renal parameters and an increased QoL. EPO itself may also play a direct role in improving the heart unrelated to the improvement of the anemia--by reducing apoptosis of cardiac and endothelial cells, increasing the number of endothelial progenitor cells, and improving endothelial cell function and neovascularization of the heart. Anemia may also play a role in the worsening of acute myocardial infarction and chronic coronary heart disease (CHD) and in the cardiovascular complications of renal transplantation.

Hepcidin levels increased as CKD progressed through stage 3-5 (P trend = 0.015) but did not correlate with estimated glomerular filtration rate. Hepcidin correlated positively with ferritin (P < 0.0001) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) (P = 0.0217) and negatively with erythropoietin (EPO) levels (P = 0.0258) but did not correlate with either hsCRP or estimated glomerular filtration rate. Iron status influenced hepcidin levels of patients. Patients were divided according to iron status on the basis of TSAT and serum ferritin levels. We observed that while absolute iron deficiency (transferrin saturation <20%, ferritin <40 ng/ml) is associated with downregulation of hepcidin, hepcidin is elevated in other two categories of CKD patients (P = 0.0039). Iron status of patients also influenced interaction between hepcidin and hemoglobin (Hb). Hepcidin correlated negatively with Hb in patients with sufficient iron status (r = -0.7452, P < 0.0001) but nearly correlated positively with Hb in patients with absolute iron deficiency (r = 0.9428, P = 0.0572). Almost similar association persisted when cutoff value for serum ferritin was raised to 100 ng/ml as per NKF/KDOQI 2006 clinical practice guidelines except that no association was observed in absolute iron deficiency category. Cutoff value for hepcidin for differentiating absolute iron deficiency from other categories in our study population is ≤ 34 ng/ml (area under curve = 0.836, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, serum hepcidin level is increased in nondialysis CKD patients as compared to healthy adults possibly due to associated inflammation and decreased renal clearance.

","van d. et al.","PURPOSE: Hemoglobin cycling has been reported in hemodialysis patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and is associated with increased mortality. Information on hemoglobin cycling in Europe is limited. We investigated hemoglobin variability in the Netherlands. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients were studied and pre-dialysis patients were enrolled. METHODS: This observational retrospective study was executed in a Dutch dialysis center. We studied 157 patients from 2005 to 2007: 56 hemodialysis, 12 peritoneal dialysis and 29 pre-dialysis patients, all treated with ESA; and 60 pre-dialysis patients without ESA. Patients were divided on the basis of their pattern of hemoglobin fluctuation around a range of 11-12 g/dL. In dialysis patients, the amount of time that hemoglobin remained within that range was calculated. For all patients, the magnitude of hemoglobin fluctuations was assessed (i.e. the difference between hemoglobin maximum and minimum) and data on ESA dose changes and hospitalizations were collected. RESULTS: None of the ESA treated patients had hemoglobin levels stable within the target range over a one-year period. Pre-dialysis patients without ESA also showed variable hemoglobin levels. A stepwise decrease in the magnitudes of hemoglobin fluctuation was observed in the hemodialysis patients, peritoneal dialysis patients, pre-dialysis patients using ESA, and the pre-dialysis patients without ESA, respectively.

","Liu W. et al.","Impaired orthostatic blood pressure (BP) stabilization is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with adverse outcomes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that reduced hemoglobin is an important contributor to orthostatic intolerance in CKD in the present study. This study included 262 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. Seated and standing BP was measured, and orthostatic BP reduction was calculated for both systolic BP (∆ SBP) and diastolic BP (∆ DBP). The association between orthostatic BP reduction and hemoglobin was determined by multiple linear regression models. We also performed mediation analysis to test to what extent the effect of renal dysfunction on impaired orthostatic BP stabilization can be explained by reduced hemoglobin. The mean age of the patients was 57.7 (±14.5) years, and 61.5% were male. Both ∆ SBP and ∆ DBP correlated negatively with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). With adjustment for age and sex, hemoglobin level was negatively associated with ∆ SBP (β = -1.4, SE = 0.4, P < .001) and ∆ DBP (β = -0.6, SE = 0.2, P = .009). The associations remained significant with further adjustment for additional covariates. When eGFR was introduced as a covariate, it did not eliminate the significance (both P < .05). The associations remained essentially unchanged in a sensitivity analysis excluding those with concurrent erythropoietin use. Mediation analysis demonstrated that reduced hemoglobin accounted for 35.4% (P = .004) of the effect of eGFR on ∆ SBP and 47.7% (P = .032) on ∆ DBP.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of peginesatide, as compared with another ESA, darbepoetin, in 983 such patients who were not undergoing dialysis. METHODS: In two randomized, controlled, open-label studies (PEARL 1 and 2), patients received peginesatide once a month, at a starting dose of 0.025 mg or 0.04 mg per kilogram of body weight, or darbepoetin once every 2 weeks, at a starting dose of 0.75 μg per kilogram. Doses of both drugs were adjusted to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between 11.0 and 12.0 g per deciliter for 52 weeks or more. The primary efficacy end point was the mean change from the baseline hemoglobin level to the mean level during the evaluation period; noninferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 97.5% confidence interval was -1.0 g per deciliter or higher. Cardiovascular safety was evaluated on the basis of an adjudicated composite end point. RESULTS: In both studies and at both starting doses, peginesatide was noninferior to darbepoetin in increasing and maintaining hemoglobin levels. The mean differences in the hemoglobin level with peginesatide as compared with darbepoetin in PEARL 1 were 0.03 g per deciliter (97.5% confidence interval [CI], -0.19 to 0.26) for the lower starting dose of peginesatide and 0.26 g per deciliter (97.5% CI, 0.04 to 0.48) for the higher starting dose, and in PEARL 2 they were 0.14 g per deciliter (97.5% CI, -0.09 to 0.36) and 0.31 g per deciliter (97.5% CI, 0.08 to 0.54), respectively. The hazard ratio for the cardiovascular safety end point was 1.32 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.81) for peginesatide relative to darbepoetin, with higher incidences of death, unstable angina, and arrhythmia with peginesatide. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of peginesatide (administered monthly) was similar to that of darbepoetin (administered every 2 weeks) in increasing and maintaining hemoglobin levels. However, cardiovascular events and mortality were increased with peginesatide in patients with chronic kidney disease who were not undergoing dialysis.

,"15663760"," Should the target hemoglobin for patients with chronic kidney disease treated with erythropoietic replacement therapy be changed? ","Berns J.","Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO, epoetin) revolutionized the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) when it was approved for use in the United States in 1989. Among dialysis patients, the mean hemoglobin (Hb) in patients undergoing dialysis rose from 7-8 g/dl prior to 1989 to 11-12 g/dl today. Among patients with CKD not on dialysis, epoetin use has not been as broadly applied as among dialysis patients, and although the mean Hb level in this patient population has increased, the impact has been less than in patients on dialysis. The optimal treatment target for epoetin remains controversial. Consistent with clinical practice guidelines, current practice in dialysis patients in the United States aims to maintain a target Hb of 11-12 g/dl, a level that is still well below the normal range. Debate centers on whether the current Hb target is too low and whether the target range is too narrow. Quality of life clearly improves in many individuals as Hb rises into the normal range from lower levels. In retrospective studies, higher Hb levels have been associated with lower risks of hospitalization and mortality. However, one large, prospective clinical trial has raised concern about normalizing Hb in hemodialysis patients with cardiac disease, and other prospective studies have not yet provided convincing evidence of significant benefits from normalizing Hb in dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD. A relative lack of information on non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD and changes in fiscal policies regulating reimbursement for epoetin have contributed to uncertainty as to the best practices for anemia management in patients with CKD. There is increasing interest in the potential benefits of broadening the current target Hb range or eliminating an upper limit altogether and instead establishing a minimum Hb goal. While some extension of the upper limit of the currently recommended target Hb range might appear to be reasonable, the extent to which this should be extended, the benefits, risks, and costs of maintaining higher Hb levels in patients with CKD, and whether target Hb levels should be different in different CKD patient groups remains to be determined. Future efforts are likely to focus on selecting patient populations most likely to benefit from normalizing Hb, while adjusting the range of a subnormal Hb target for others.","2005","Seminars in dialysis"," Consistent with clinical practice guidelines , current practice in dialysis patients in the United States aims to maintain a target Hb of 11-12 g / dl , a level that is still well below the normal range ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

In this study, we investigated associations between low hemoglobin levels and psoriasis in patients with CKD using data from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea. During a mean follow-up period of 6.16 ± 1.02 years, psoriasis was recorded in 13,803 patients with CKD (2.39% of CKD patients). The cumulative incidence of psoriasis was significantly higher in CKD patients with anemia (hemoglobin levels < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women) than those without. In multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, the risk of psoriasis was significantly higher in anemic CKD patients than nonanemic CKD patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.136, 95% CI 1.089-1.185, p < 0.001). Additionally, we noted that the incidence of psoriasis decreased with increasing hemoglobin levels in CKD patients (HR 0.953, 95% CI 0.942-0.965, p < 0.001). Altogether, our findings indicate that low hemoglobin levels are significantly related to psoriasis risk in patients with CKD.

NGAL was inversely correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, serum iron, and TSAT. NGAL adequately diagnosed the status of iron deficiency among CKD patients by ROC analysis. The optimal NGAL cutoff value able to identify iron deficiency was found to be > 244.8 ng/mL, with 73.01% sensitivity and 68.29% specificity.

For the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), we used the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.

The patients were stratified according to their GFR as follows: stage 1: 19 patients, stage 2: 35 patients, stage 3: 67 patients, stage 4: 68 patients, and stage 5: 61 patients. The composite of proteinuria and abnormal imaging in stages 1 and 2 was satisfied in 100% of the cases. The prevalence of anemia was elevated for the hemoglobin levels below 12 g/dL (the level at which the evaluation of anemia in CKD should be initiated) in the different stages of CKD, that is, 42%, 33%, 48%, 71%, and 82% in the stages from 1 to 5, respectively.

RESULTS: Among 97,636 patients with CKD and anemia, we observed 68,556 transfusion events (61 events per 100 person-years), 86.6% of which occurred in inpatient settings. At all Hb levels, transfusion events were highest during periods of no treatment and increased with declining Hb levels.

RECENT FINDINGS: The Normal Hematocrit Study, Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin-beta, Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency, and Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy demonstrate increased risk of mortality and/or cardiovascular complications with targeting of a higher hemoglobin (Hb) in CKD patients. Although a higher Hb level was targeted in these trials, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) exposure itself might account for the observed increased risk. This is because, in these trials, achieving a normal or near normal Hb was associated with improved survival and reduced cardiovascular risk. Indeed, it was the 'targeting' of a higher Hb with ESA that seemed to be the problem. Observational data, although conflicting, on the whole provide support for high dosage of ESA being harmful but cannot, by their very nature, prove causality. SUMMARY: After 20 years of ESA use, is it plausible that ESAs could be toxic? How does one reconcile conflicting observational data with a hypothesis that postulates ESA toxicity? Does the biology of erythropoietin provide a mechanistic explanation? The answers to these questions, among others, will be important in charting a future role for ESAs in treating CKD anemia.","2010","Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : This article examines the potential mechanisms underlying adverse risk observed in four randomized controlled trials of anemia correction in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patients ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The question remains as to whether normalizing hemoglobin (Hgb) is desirable in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review provides an analysis and commentary on the available reports and, for the most part, randomized, controlled trials on the topic. In dialysis patients, normalization of Hgb is associated with improved quality of life and exercise capacity but not with reduced mortality and hospitalization rate. Moreover, no significant changes in the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy have been demonstrated. By contrast, an increased mortality rate has been reported for hemodialysis patients with overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) when randomly assigned to normal hematocrit by EPO. Data regarding patients who have CKD but are not yet on renal replacement therapy are scarce, and the effects of EPO on renal disease progression require further elucidation through controlled trials. The conclusion that can be drawn from the available studies is that Hgb >11 g/dl is the minimum required to achieve improved quality of life in patients with CKD, whereas values >12 g/dl are not recommended for patients with overt CVD.

","Nissenson A.","Since its introduction, recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has become the standard of care for renal anemia. Because of its relatively short half-life, however, it generally is administered two to three times per week. Darbepoetin alfa (novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein [NESP]) is a longer acting erythropoietic agent that allows less frequent dosing to treat anemia. Decreased dosing frequency should result in enhanced patient compliance and convenience and minimize the burden of frequent administration on staff. NESP is biochemically distinct from rHuEPO, having five N-linked carbohydrate chains (two more than rHuEPO). In animal studies, NESP had a half-life approximately three times longer than rHuEPO and raised hemoglobin effectively when administered less frequently than rHuEPO. NESP has been evaluated in clinical trials of dialysis and chronic kidney disease patients. Pharmacokinetic data confirmed that patients with anemia required less frequent dosing with NESP than rHuEPO. After intravenous administration, the mean elimination half-life of NESP was 25.3 hours versus 8.5 hours for rHuEPO. In patients who are rHuEPO-naive and in patients previously managed with rHuEPO, NESP is as effective as rHuEPO for maintaining hemoglobin concentration when administered intravenously or subcutaneously at a reduced frequency of once weekly or once every other week. NESP is well tolerated and has a safety profile comparable to that of rHuEPO. There have been no reports of antibody formation associated with NESP. NESP is an important new tool for physicians to use in the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease.","2001","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Bárány P. and Müller H.","The introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents radically advanced the management of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The European Best Practice Guidelines recommend that most patients with CKD achieve a target haemoglobin (Hb) >/=11 g/dl to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. The optimal upper Hb level has not been determined and will likely vary among CKD patient populations. Recently reported studies show evidence that normalising Hb ( approximately 14 g/dl) in CKD may increase the risk of adverse events and puts attention to the importance of the upper Hb target. Most patients can achieve target Hb levels with proper treatment. However, recent studies have demonstrated that while average Hb levels may fall within desired targets, the Hb levels of many patients are not being adequately controlled, i.e. their Hb levels are not consistently maintained within a specified target range over time. Furthermore, data indicate that failing to control Hb levels over time may increase the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. This review will discuss the challenges in controlling Hb in the CKD patient population, particularly in haemodialysis patients. Factors that affect Hb control over time will be considered, as well as the clinical criteria for its assessment. Although challenging, control of Hb is manageable and has potential clinical benefits.","2007","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Methods: Prospective cohort study. At baseline, a total of 7 407 nondiabetic patients without a history of CKD from Pingguoyuan Community of the Shijingshan District in Beijing were included from December 2011 to August 2012, who were then divided into three groups according to the tertiles of their baseline HGI levels. The CKD incidence rate was compared among the different HGI groups at last follow-up. Cox multivariable regression was applied to evaluate whether HGI measures predicted CKD risk. Test for trend across tertiles were examined using ordinal values in separate models. Results: The mean age of the subjects was (56.4±7.5) years, and 4 933 (66.6%) were female. At mean follow-up of 3.23 years, 107 (1.4%) individuals developed CKD.

Because little free iron is present in the preparation, doses of 510 mg have been administered safely in as little as 17 seconds. Two prospective, randomized studies compared two doses of ferumoxytol 510 mg given in 5 +/- 3 days with 3 weeks of oral iron 200 mg/day (as ferrous fumarate) in anemic patients with CKD. One study enrolled 304 patients with stages 1-5 CKD (predialysis), and the other study enrolled 230 patients with stage 5D CKD (undergoing hemodialysis). In both studies, a greater increase in hemoglobin level from baseline to end of study (day 35) was noted in patients who received ferumoxytol compared with those who received oral iron (mean +/- SD 0.82 +/- 1.24 vs 0.16 +/- 1.02 g/dl in patients with stages 1-5 CKD and 1.02 +/- 1.13 vs 0.46 +/- 1.06 g/dl in patients with stage 5D CKD, p<0.001). A greater proportion of both predialysis and hemodialysis patients who received ferumoxytol had hemoglobin level increases from baseline of 1 g/dl or more compared with those who received oral iron (p<0.001). In a prospective, double-blind, crossover study of more than 700 patients with CKD stages 1-5D that compared the safety of ferumoxytol with normal saline injection, the rates of treatment-related adverse events were 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively. Serious treatment-related adverse events were seen in one patient in each treatment group. The most common adverse events with ferumoxytol occurred at the injection site (bruising, pain, swelling, erythema). Dizziness, nausea, pruritus, headache, and fatigue occurred in less than 2% of patients receiving ferumoxytol, with a similar frequency noted after administration of normal saline. In short-term studies, intravenous ferumoxytol was safely and rapidly administered, and was more effective than oral iron therapy in increasing hemoglobin levels in anemic patients with CKD. Long-term clinical trials with clinical outcomes and studies comparing ferumoxytol with other parenteral iron agents will help define the role of ferumoxytol in treating the anemia of CKD.","2010","Pharmacotherapy",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Levin A.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anemia is a well recognized complication of chronic kidney disease and is associated with significant morbidity. It is important for clinical care to identify appropriate treatments and targets for hemoglobin. This review describes current understandings of the treatment of anemia using the most recent published articles. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies, including observational and randomized control trials, of varying sizes and using both surrogate and hard outcomes have been published. On balance, there is little to support normalization of hemoglobin in the chronic kidney disease population. While some studies have described harm, there are some issues related to overinterpretation based on study trial reporting. The treatment of anemia can be successfully achieved with the use of oral or intravenous iron and erythropoiten-stimulating agents. Caution should be exercised when treating those with significant cardiovascular morbidity, and those who require very high doses of erythropoiten-stimulating agents to achieve normal hemoglobin. SUMMARY: Large observational population-based studies continue to demonstrate the association of low hemoglobin with adverse outcomes, and randomized control trials fail to show a benefit of normalized hemoglobin. Anemia therapy does improve quality of life. In the current era of aggressive chronic kidney disease management, it does not appear that anemia therapy attenuates left ventricular growth or changes cardiovascular outcomes.","2007","Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Anemia is a well recognized complication of chronic kidney disease and is associated with significant morbidity ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"21612756"," Anemia, inflammation and health-related quality of life in chronic kidney disease patients. ","Farag Y. et al.","BACKGROUND: There is controversy regarding whether an incremental increase in hemoglobin levels is associated with improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). We hypothesized that HRQOL in anemic CKD patients has a multifactorial etiology, including the effects of anemia and inflammation. METHODS: 69 non-dialysis CKD patients over 18 years of age with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 43.7 ± 28.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 were divided into anemic and non-anemic cohorts. Kidney disease quality of life (KDQOL) was prospectively recorded using Short Form (SF)-36 components of KDQOL-SF-™ version 1.3 questionnaire. Inflammation was assessed by using a composite of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels in the upper two quartiles. RESULTS: Anemic patients had significantly worse SF-36 components of KDQOL-SF-™ version 1.3, including SF-12 mental component (p = 0.02), role emotional (p = 0.002) and physical function (p = 0.01) compared to patients without anemia. However, in multiple linear regression models, adjusted for GFR, age, gender and inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, ferritin, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, anemia predicted mental components of SF-36 (SF-12 mental component (p = 0.02) and role emotional (p = 0.04)) but not physical components (SF-12 physical component (p > 0.05) and physical function (p > 0.05), supporting the multifactorial nature of reduced HRQOL in anemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced HRQOL in anemic patients is likely related to both anemic and inflammatory status. Prospective studies will be needed to evaluate whether modulating the inflammatory state independent of changes in the hemoglobin concentration improves physical components of HRQOL.","2011","Clinical nephrology",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Ferrari P. et al.","AIM: To assess whether pentoxifylline improves anaemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) via suppression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and improved iron mobilization. BACKGROUND: CKD patients may have elevated IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha levels. These cytokines can increase hepcidin production, which in turn reduces iron release from macrophages resulting in reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis. In experimental models, pentoxifylline was shown to reduce IL-6 expression. METHODS: We studied 14 patients with stages 4-5 CKD (glomerular filtration rate <30mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) due to non-inflammatory renal diseases. None of the patients had received immunosuppressive or erythropoietin-stimulating agents or parenteral iron. Patients had weekly blood tests for iron studies and cytokines during a control run-in period of 3 weeks and during 4 weeks of pentoxifylline treatment. RESULTS: Ten patients (eGFR 23 + or - 6 mL/min) completed the study. At the end of the run-in period average haemoglobin was 111 + or - 5 g/L, ferritin 92 + or - 26 microg/L, transferrin saturation 15 + or - 3% and circulating IL-6 10.6 + or - 3.8 pg/mL. Tumour necrosis factor alpha values were below threshold for detection. Treatment with pentoxifylline reduced circulating IL-6 (6.6 + or - 1.6 pg/mL, P < 0.01), increased transferrin saturation (20 + or - 5%, P < 0.003) and decreased serum ferritin (81 + or - 25 microg/L, P = NS). Haemoglobin increased after the second week of pentoxifylline, reaching 123 + or - 6 g/L by week 4 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline reduces circulating IL-6 and improves haemoglobin in non-inflammatory moderate to severe CKD. These changes are associated with changes in circulating transferrin saturation and ferritin, suggesting improved iron release. It is hypothesized that pentoxifylline improves iron disposition possibly through modulation of hepcidin.","2010","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)"," AIM : To assess whether pentoxifylline improves anaemia of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) via suppression of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and improved iron mobilization ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Existing studies have mostly addressed the pathogenesis and treatment of bone metabolism abnormality and anemia in patients with CKD, but few have evaluated their mutual connection. Administration of exogenous erythropoietin to CKD patients with anemia used to be the mainstay of therapeutic approaches; however, with the availability of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizers such as roxadustat, more therapeutic choices for renal anemia are expected in the future. However, the effects posed by the hypoxic environment on both CKD complications remain incompletely understood. AIM: To summarize the relationship between renal anemia and abnormal bone metabolism, and to discuss the influence of hypoxia on bone metabolism. METHODS: CNKI and PubMed searches were performed using the key words ""chronic kidney disease,"" ""abnormal bone metabolism,"" ""anemia,"" ""hypoxia,"" and ""HIF"" to identify relevant articles published in multiple languages and fields. Reference lists from identified articles were reviewed to extract additional pertinent articles. Then we retrieved the Abstract and Introduction and searched the results from the literature, classified the extracted information, and summarized important information. Finally, we made our own conclusions. RESULTS: There is a bidirectional relationship between renal anemia and abnormal bone metabolism. Abnormal vitamin D metabolism and hyperparathyroidism can affect bone metabolism, blood cell production, and survival rates through multiple pathways. Anemia will further attenuate the normal bone growth. The hypoxic environment regulates bone morphogenetic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor, and neuropilin-1, and affects osteoblast/osteoclast maturation and differentiation through bone metabolic changes. Hypoxia preconditioning of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can enhance their paracrine effects and promote fracture healing. Concurrently, hypoxia reduces the inhibitory effect on osteocyte differentiation by inhibiting the expression of fibroblast growth factor 23. Hypoxia potentially improves bone metabolism, but it still carries potential risks. The optimal concentration and duration of hypoxia remain unclear. CONCLUSION: There is a bidirectional relationship between renal anemia and abnormal bone metabolism. Hypoxia may improve bone metabolism but the concentration and duration of hypoxia remain unclear and need further study.","2021","World journal of clinical cases"," AIM : To summarize the relationship between renal anemia and abnormal bone metabolism , and to discuss the influence of hypoxia on bone metabolism ","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This was a cross-sectional study of 896 participants from the NEFRONA study (273 CKD3, 246 CKD4-5, 282 dialysis and 95 controls). The levels of 25(OH) and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, intact FGF23 (iFGF23) and soluble Klotho were measured, together with standard blood biochemistries. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels < 13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. Patients with anemia (407, 45.4%) were younger, mostly men and diabetic; were in advanced CKD stages; had lower calcium, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D and albumin levels; and had higher ferritin, phosphate, intact PTH, and iFGF23. An inverse correlation was observed between hemoglobin and both iFGF23 and phosphate. The multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the adjusted risk of anemia was independently associated with higher serum phosphate and LogiFGF23 levels (ORs (95% CIs) of 4.33 (2.11−8.90) and 8.75 (3.17−24.2), respectively (p < 0.001)). A significant interaction between phosphate and iFGF23 (OR of 0.66 (0.53−0.83), p < 0.001) showed that the rise in the adjusted predicted risk of anemia with the increase in iFGF23 was steeper when phosphate levels were low. Phosphate levels acted as modifiers of the effect of iFGF23 concentration on anemia. Thus, the effect of the increase in iFGF23 levels was stronger when phosphate levels were low.","2022","Nutrients",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This study was designed to determine the variability in Hgb values for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving or not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) compared with patients on dialysis receiving ESAs. METHODS: This cross-sectional review of anemia management in CKD and dialysis patients analyzed Hgb variability by patient-year, defined as the coefficient of variability calculated for individual patients. One hundred thirty-seven CKD patient-years and 350 dialysis patient-years were available for analysis. Hgb variability was defined as the coefficient of variability calculated as the individual patient's Hgb standard deviation divided by the patient's mean Hgb times 100. RESULTS: The coefficient of variability in Hgb values were significantly less in patients with CKD not treated with ESAs than in patients with CKD treated with ESAs whether they were receiving dialysis (medians: 3.96 versus 8.53%, P < 0.05) or not receiving dialysis (medians: 3.96 versus 7.37%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CKD and hemodialysis patients receiving treatment with ESAs have significantly greater Hgb variability than patients with CKD not receiving ESAs.

","Del V. and Locatelli F.","INTRODUCTION: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been the main therapy for anemia in CKD patients since the late eighties. Since then, treatment indications have progressively changed, together with a progressive increase in therapeutic targets, in terms of hemoglobin levels. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses possible concerns about ESA use and increased cardiovascular risk (in particular stroke), hypertension, cancer progression and the development of pure red cell aplasia. A literature search was done on PubMed to obtain studies about the adverse effects of ESA in the CKD population. EXPERT OPINION: The publication of the TREAT study has largely contributed to the concerns about ESA use, indicating that complete anemia correction may not be safe in the CKD population. This may be particularly true in high-risk patients, especially if hyporesponsive to ESA treatment. However, there is a gray area of no evidence either way for intermediate levels (11.5 - 13 g/dl), in comparison with higher or lower levels. New recommendations about ESA use in the CKD population by the Food and Drug Administration seem to move toward treatment individualization.","2012","Expert opinion on drug safety",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

,"22536082"," Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta for anemia with chronic kidney disease. ","Ohashi N. et al.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for end-stage renal failure and cardiovascular events. In patients with CKD, anemia is often caused by decreased erythropoietin production relative to hemoglobin levels. As correction of anemia is associated with improved cardiac and renal function and quality of life, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are standard therapy for anemia in CKD patients. However, traditional ESAs such as epoetin or darbepoetin have short half-lives and require frequent administration, dose changes, and close monitoring of hemoglobin concentration to maintain target hemoglobin levels. Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (MPG-EPO) is the only ESA that is generated by chemical modification of glycosylated erythropoietin through the integration of one specific, long, linear chain of polyethylene glycol. This ESA induces continuous erythropoietin receptor activation and has a long half-life (approximately 130 hours). Subcutaneous or intravenous administration of MPG-EPO once every 2 weeks or monthly achieved a high hemoglobin response rate in patients with anemia associated with CKD, regardless of whether the patient was undergoing dialysis. According to data from an observational time and motion study, MPG-EPO maintains hemoglobin levels when the same dose is administered, however infrequently. This suggests that compared with the use of traditional ESAs, administration of MPG-EPO reduces the overall time and cost associated with the management of anemia in CKD patients undergoing dialysis. MPG-EPO is generally well tolerated and most adverse events are of mild to moderate severity. The most commonly reported adverse effects are hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and diarrhea. Subcutaneous injection of MPG-EPO is significantly less painful than subcutaneous injection of darbepoetin. In conclusion, MPG-EPO is as effective and safe as traditional ESAs in managing renal anemia, irrespective of whether the patient is undergoing dialysis.","2012","International journal of nephrology and renovascular disease",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Treatment of anemia in the early stages of CKD is essential to reduce the risk of developing anemia-associated complications and to improve health-related quality of life. Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO, epoetin alfa) can correct erythropoietin deficiency and increase red blood cell production, but the short half-life of r-HuEPO necessitates frequent injections. Reducing the frequency of administration has potential benefits for both patients and health care providers. Darbepoetin alfa is a new erythropoietic protein with greater biologic activity and a longer dosing interval than those of r-HuEPO. It has been shown to be effective when administered once/week and once every 2, 3, or 4 weeks, and is well tolerated.

METHODOLOGY: All participants were initially started on erythropoietin alpha and then converted to erythropoietin beta after three months. The effectiveness of the erythropoietin alpha and erythropoietin beta was calculated on the basis of net change of mean hemoglobin and mean hematocrit level in the last four weeks on either erythropoietin therapy. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients completed the study, in which 47 (58.8%) were males while 33 (41.3%) were females. The mean age was 59.7 ± 14.7 years. The net mean hemoglobin change during last 04 weeks was ̶ 0.19 ± 1.2 and ̶ 0.03 ± 1.0 for erythropoietin alpha and erythropoietin erythropoietin beta, respectively (p = 0.41).

Daprodustat is effective in subjects who are hyporesponsive to ESAs, and this is one circumstance when daprodustat may be preferred to ESAs. However, to become a widely used medicine in subjects with CKD responsive to ESAs, daprodustat needs to be well tolerated, used by a high percentage of subjects over a long time, and be superior to ESAs in improving clinical outcomes. As this may not be the case, there is not a strong basis for recommending daprodustat over ESAs.

We evaluated the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), a non-dextran parenteral iron permitting large single-dose infusions, versus iron sucrose in patients with iron-deficiency anemia and NDD-CKD. METHODS: A total of 2584 participants were randomized to two doses of FCM 750 mg in one week, or iron sucrose 200 mg administered in up to five infusions in 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change to highest hemoglobin from baseline to Day 56. The primary composite safety endpoint included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and hyper- and hypotensive events. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin increase was 1.13 g/dL in the FCM group and 0.92 g/dL in the iron sucrose group (95% CI, 0.13-0.28). Similar results were observed across all subgroups, except Stage 2 CKD. More subjects in the FCM group achieved a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.0 g/dL between baseline and Day 56 (48.6 versus 41.0%; 95% CI, 3.6-11.6%). There was no significant difference between FCM and iron sucrose recipients with respect to the primary composite safety endpoint, including the major adverse cardiac events of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. A significant difference in the number of protocol-defined, predominantly transient hypertensive episodes was observed in the FCM group.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Hb variability was determined using 6 mo of ""baseline"" data between January 1, 2003, and October 31, 2005. A variety of definitions for Hb variability were examined to ensure consistency and robustness. RESULTS: A total of 6165 patients from 22 centers in seven countries were followed for a mean of 34.0 +/- 15.8 mo; 49% were prescribed an ESA. There was increased Hb variability with ESA use; the residual SD of Hb was 4.9 +/- 4.4 g/L in patients who were not receiving an ESA, compared with 6.8 +/- 4.8 g/L. Hb variability was associated with a small but significantly increased risk for death per g/L residual SD, irrespective of ESA use. Multivariate linear regression model explained only 11% of the total variance of Hb variability. CONCLUSIONS: Hb variability is increased in patients who have CKD and are receiving ESA and is associated with an increased risk for death (even in those who are not receiving ESAs).

Although the biological mechanisms linking anemia, renal failure, and heart failure are incompletely understood, more prevalent anemia is consistent in patients with more severe heart failure and is associated with higher mortality rates. Impaired erythropoietin production and resistance to erythropoietin are major contributors to anemia in patients with heart failure. By targeting hemoglobin levels in anemic patients with CKD, through the use of recombinant erythropoietin (epoetin) therapy, it has been hoped that anemia, CKD, and heart failure outcomes can be improved.

SUMMARY: Approximately 20 million people in the United States population have CKD, and 2-4 million of these may also have anemia, which often goes undetected and untreated. Patients with CKD are now classified into five stages based on the degree of kidney function impairment. Here, anemia is caused by insufficient erythropoietin production, and may occur as early as stage 3 CKD. Potential consequences of anemia include cognitive impairment, angina, and the cardiorenal anemia syndrome, a triad of worsening anemia, worsening CKD, and worsening congestive heart failure. Treatment of anemia in predialysis patients with stage 2-4 CKD may slow renal disease progression and improve energy, work capacity, health-related quality of life, and cardiac function. Optimizing the hemoglobin or hematocrit value before initiating dialysis may reduce mortality. Anemia contributes to significant healthcare costs associated with CKD. Substitution of the subcutaneous route of administration for the intravenous route of administration for epoetin alfa can reduce drug acquisition and healthcare costs, the two largest components of healthcare costs in CKD patients. Efforts to slow the progression of CKD could also have a substantial impact on hospitalizations and costs. CONCLUSION: Correcting anemia has the potential to improve clinical and economic outcomes in patients with CKD.","2007","American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists"," PURPOSE : The prevalence of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) and anemia in the United States , classification scheme for CKD , definition of anemia , etiology and consequences of anemia in patients with CKD , and the clinical and economic benefits of correcting anemia are described ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kogika M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia and systemic oxidative stress may occur in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Only scarce information regarding the intraerythrocytic redox status under these conditions is available at this time. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the indicators of oxidative stress and intraerythrocytic antioxidant defense in dogs with anemia of CKD. METHODS: Thirty dogs with CKD in stages 3 or 4 with nonregenerative anemia (HCT ≤ 37%) were compared to 20 healthy dogs. Complete blood count, reticulocyte %, blood smear evaluation, intraerythrocytic concentrations of total (GSHt), reduced (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSH), and activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBAR) were determined. RESULTS: Anemia of CKD dogs was nonregenerative (reticulocytes ≤ 0.2% with scarce anisocytosis and poikilocytosis). Intraerythrocytic GSSH and SOD, and plasma TBAR were higher in dogs with CKD. There was a positive correlation between the creatinine concentration and TBAR, and negative correlations between creatinine concentration and HCT, as well as between HCT and TBAR. In CKD dogs with a higher degree of anemia, SOD levels were higher and GSSH concentrations were lower. Despite the evidence of increased systemic oxidative stress, the compensatory response of SOD and the sustained intraerythrocytic concentrations of GSSH in CKD dogs with anemia indicated that the erythrocytes maintained the antioxidant defense. CONCLUSIONS: There was no strong evidence that oxidative stress was associated with higher degrees of anemia in dogs with CKD.","2015","Veterinary clinical pathology"," OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the indicators of oxidative stress and intraerythrocytic antioxidant defense in dogs with anemia of CKD ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Nangaku M.","Chronic kidney disease leads to dysfunction of renal erythropoietin-producing cells, resulting in a decrease in erythrocyte production. A decrease in oxygen delivery to vital organs due to anemia results in worse quality of life and is associated with poor prognosis of the patients. Treatment with human recombinant erythropoietin or its improved version of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) with a longer half-life is effective. However, some patients show hyporesponsiveness to ESA. Hyporesponsiveness to ESA, which can be induced by factors such as inflammation and uremic toxins, is associated with poor prognosis. Production of erythropoietin in the kidney is regulated by a transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).

","Iida A. et al.","Ferric citrate is an oral iron-based phosphate binder, being known to affect iron status and improve iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We examined whether oral administration of ferric citrate could change iron status and improve anemia without affecting phosphorus metabolism in iron deficiency anemia rats. In Normal rat study, normal rats were fed a diet containing 0.3 or 3% ferric citrate for 11 days for setting the dose and administration period of ferric citrate. The effects of ferric citrate on iron status- and phosphorus metabolism-related parameters were evaluated using blood and urine samples. Next, an iron deficiency anemia was induced by feeding iron-depleted diet in rats. After 7 days of starting the iron-depleted diet, 0.3% ferric citrate was administered for 7 days by dietary admixture. Iron status- and phosphorus metabolism-related parameters were evaluated with blood and urine samples. In Normal rat study, 3% ferric citrate treatment increased serum iron level and transferrin saturation (TSAT), and decreased serum phosphorus level, intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23) level, and urinary phosphorus excretion, but 0.3% ferric citrate treatment showed no effects. On the other hand, in Iron deficiency anemia rat study, 0.3% ferric citrate treatment increased iron status-related parameters and improved anemia, but did not show any apparent changes in phosphorus metabolism-related parameters. In conclusion, ferric citrate could have hematopoietic effects without affecting phosphorus metabolism, and could be a potential option for the treatment of IDA in patients without CKD.","2020","The Journal of veterinary medical science",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","McClellan W. et al.","OBJECTIVE: Anemia is a complication of chronic kidney disease and may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Early identification and treatment of anemia may improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. No large-scale population data are available specifically for patients with chronic kidney disease regarding prevalence of anemia, subpopulations at risk, and relationships between anemia and kidney function. This study was undertaken to address these questions in patients with chronic kidney disease, and investigate the relationship between anemia and glomerular filtration rate. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Large-scale, cross-sectional, US multicenter survey; 5222 patients (mean age, 68.2 years; 46.6% male); 237 physician practices. Eligible patients: > or = 18 years of age; serum creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL-6.0 mg/dL (females), 2.0 mg/dL-6.0 mg/dL (males). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary study end point: prevalence and severity of anemia (hemoglobin < or = 12 g/dL). Data further stratified by hemoglobin (< or = 12 g/dL, < or = 10 g/dL). RESULTS: Primary etiologies of chronic kidney disease (5222 evaluable patients): diabetes (49.5%); hypertension (33.0%). Glomerular filtration rate: < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 97.7% of evaluable patients. Mean +/- SD serum creatinine level: 2.2 mg/dL +/- 0.9 mg/dL; 2.5 mg/dL +/- 1.0 mg/dL for males, 2.0 mg/dL +/- 0.8 mg/dL for females. Mean +/- SD hemoglobin: 12.2 g/dL +/- 1.6 g/dL (47.7% had hemoglobin < or = 12 g/dL; 8.9% had hemoglobin < or = 10 g/dL). Prevalence of anemia was strongly associated with declining glomerular filtration rate. Percentage of patients with hemoglobin < or = 12 g/dL increased from 26.7% to 75.5% when glomerular filtration rate decreased from > or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of hemoglobin < or = 10 g/dL increased substantially from 5.2% to 27.2% when glomerular filtration rate diminished from > or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. After controlling for other patient characteristics associated with increased prevalence of anemia, the prevalence odds ratio for hemoglobin < or = 10 g/dL was 0.54 (0.49-0.60) and for hemoglobin < or = 12 g/dL was 0.68 (0.65-0.72), with each 10-mL/min/1.73 m2 increase in glomerular filtration rate. Predictors of anemia: diabetes, female sex, and race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia was present in 47.7% of 5222 predialysis patients with chronic kidney disease.

","Margaretos N. et al.","BACKGROUND: Because health plans each issue their own policies, drug coverage can vary. This variation can result in patients having unequal access to treatment. In this study, we evaluate commercial health plans' coverage policies for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for patients with anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVES: To assess how a set of US commercial health plans cover ESAs for patients with anemia due to CKD. Our second objective was to examine the evidence that the plans reviewed when formulating their coverage policies. METHODS: We used the Tufts Medical Center Specialty Drug and Evidence and Coverage Database to identify coverage policies issued by 17 of the largest US commercial health plans for ESAs. The following drugs were indicated for anemia due to CKD: darbepoetin alfa, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, epoetin alfa (available as two brands), and epoetin alfa-epbx. Coverage policies were current as of May 2019. We determined whether the health plans applied any restrictions, such as step therapy protocols or patient subgroup restrictions, in their coverage policies. We categorized the evidence that plans cited to support their policies into seven categories: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence (RWE) studies (studies based on data collected in a real-world setting), other clinical studies (eg, single arm trials), systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, clinical or treatment guidelines, health technology assessments, and economic evaluations. RESULTS: We categorized 72.5% of coverage policies (58/80 policies) as equivalent to the FDA label and 27.5% (22/80 policies) as more restrictive. In restricted policies, plans most often applied step therapy protocols (18/22 policies), followed by prescriber requirements (4/22 policies), and patient subgroup restrictions (3/22 policies). Five health plans applied restrictions in at least half of their coverage policies; seven plans did not apply restrictions in any policy. Plans that cited evidence reviewed an average of 10 citations across their ESA coverage policies, ranging from one to 29 studies. Plans varied with respect to the types of cited studies: at least 50% of evidence cited by five health plans was RCTs, while half or more of the evidence cited by four health plans was clinical or treatment guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Health plans varied in how they covered ESAs for patients with anemia due to CKD and in the evidence cited in their coverage policies. Inconsistencies in plans' coverage policies may have implications for patients' access to ESAs. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization.

","Wong M. et al.","BACKGROUND: International variation in anemia assessment and management practices in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is poorly understood. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of anemia laboratory monitoring, prevalence and management in the prospective Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (CKDopps). A total of 6766 participants with CKD Stages 3a-5ND from nephrology clinics in Brazil, France, Germany and the USA were included. RESULTS: Among patients with anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL), 36-58% in Brazil, the USA and Germany had repeat hemoglobin measured and 40-61% had iron indices measured within 3 months of the index hemoglobin measurement. Anemia was more common in the USA and Brazil than in France and Germany across CKD stages. Higher ferritin and lower iron saturation (TSAT) levels were observed with lower hemoglobin levels, and higher ferritin with more advanced CKD. The proportion of anemic patients with ferritin <100 ng/mL or TSAT <20% ranged from 42% in Brazil to 53% in France and Germany, and of these patients, over 40% in Brazil, Germany and the USA, compared with 27% in France, were treated with oral or intravenous iron within 3 months after hemoglobin measurement. The proportion of patients with hemoglobin <10 g/dL treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ranged from 28% in the USA to 57% in Germany. CONCLUSIONS: Hemoglobin and iron stores are measured less frequently than per guidelines. Among all regions, there was a substantial proportion of anemic patients with iron deficiency who were not treated with iron, highlighting an area for practice improvement in CKD care.","2020","Clinical kidney journal",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This study was designed to describe the prevalence of CKD and associated comorbidities in a representative sample of NH residents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study as a component of a prospective observational study of CKD and anemia in the NH population. SETTING: Eighty-two geographically representative NHs in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 794 NH residents who had complete baseline data collected. MEASUREMENTS: Residents for whom consent was obtained underwent a record review focused on identifying a predefined set of comorbid conditions, clinical assessment, and blood and urine collections. Stage of CKD was based on estimated GFR (eGFR) using the MDRD equation: no CKD (eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), Stage 3a (45-59), Stage 3b (30-44), and Stage 4/5 (< 30). RESULTS: Consent was obtained from 847 of 1626 residents screened; 32 were ineligible and 21 dropped out of the study; complete data were available for 794 residents. CKD was present in approximately 50% of residents; of these residents with CKD, 47.6% were stage 3a, 39.27% stage 3b, and 13.2% stage 4/5. Fifty percent of the population had anemia, and anemia was more common in those with CKD. The average number of comorbid conditions in the population was 5.3 (SD 2.2); the proportion of patients with multiple comorbid conditions, especially cardiovascular conditions, increased with increasing stage of CKD. Among those without CKD, 57% had 5 or more comorbidities in comparison to 87% of those with stage 4/5 CKD. CONCLUSIONS: In this representative sample of 794 US NH residents, 50% had clinical evidence of CKD. Patients with CKD, particularly those at later stages, were more likely to have cardiovascular comorbidities and anemia.

To elucidate the effect of hemoglobin (Hb) on the predictive value of HbA1c, we enrolled 1558 diabetic patients with stages 3-4 CKD, categorized according to baseline Hb and HbA1c quartiles. Linear regression revealed that higher HbA1c correlated significantly with higher Hb in the Hb < 10 g/dL group (β = 0.146, P = 0.004). A fully-adjusted Cox regression model revealed worse clinical outcomes in patients with higher HbA1c quartiles in the Hb ≥ 10 g/dL group. Hazard ratios for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), all-cause mortality, and composite endpoint (cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality) in patients with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL and the highest HbA1c quartile were 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.15), 1.76 (95% CI, 1.02-3.03), and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.03-2.31), respectively. By contrast, HbA1c was not associated with clinical outcomes in the Hb < 10 g/dL group.

Anemia has been associated with progressive loss of kidney function and increased mortality. Ferric citrate was recently developed, primarily as a novel oral, non-calcium phosphate binder, which has also shown to replenish the iron deficient state of the CKD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study was done on 40 pre-dialysis adult patients of CKD (stage 3-5) from a tertiary care centre in North India. Patients on intravenous iron, erythropoietin stimulating agents or other phosphate binders were excluded from the study. All the patients were given tablet ferric citrate (each tablet containing ferric citrate 1.1 gm equivalent to ferric iron 210 mg) in a dose of 3 tablets per day for three months. Patients were followed up at two weekly intervals and relevant investigations were done. They were divided into three groups according to their CKD stages for subgroup analysis. OBSERVATIONS: After three months of therapy with ferric citrate there was a significant decrease in mean serum phosphate from 6.55±0.70 mg/dl at baseline to 4.36±0.50 mg/dl at the end of three months (p<0.001). Mean hemoglobin increased from 7.92±1.05 g/dl at baseline to 10.96±1.04 g/dl at the end of three months (p<0.001). Serum ferritin and serum transferrin saturation increased from 278.25±110.56 ng/dl, 25.02±4.03 % at baseline to 401.24±152.47 ng/dl and 29.62±3.77 % at the end of three months. The mean serum vitamin D and serum iPTH levels, at baseline and at the end of 3 months were 14.61±10.80 ng/ml, 509.48±210.75 pg/ml and 23.65±14.00 ng/ml, 424.14±173.18 pg/ml respectively.

ANIMALS: 8 healthy adult dogs (controls), and 24 dogs with CKD, equally divided into 3 groups based on International Renal Interest Society-CKD Guidelines (stage 2, 3, and 4) were recruited between December 2012 and December 2014. METHODS: The following were assessed in all dogs and then compared between groups: bone marrow cytology, CBC, reticulocyte count, urinalysis, serum biochemistry, blood pressure, occult gastrointestinal bleeding, and serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), erythropoietin, interleukin-1β, interleukin-3, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and interferon-γ. RESULTS: Erythropoiesis inducing and suppressing factors and the results of the bone marrow cytology of dogs in stage 2 CKD did not differ from the control group. The presence of reticulocytosis in CKD stage 2 suggests that blood loss or erythrocyte destruction might be contributing to developing anemia. Anemia in dogs with progressive CKD was associated with increasing PTH and TNFα and with elevation of the ratio of myeloid to erythroid precursor cells caused by hypoplasia of the erythroid series. The latter was represented mainly by a decrease in the population of polychromatophilic rubricytes and metarubricytes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increased PTH and TNFα seem to contribute to the reduced percentage of polychromatophilic rubricytes and erythroid population, thereby aggravating the anemia of dogs with advanced CKD.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 100 healthy controls and 239 CKD patients, including 46 secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) patients with PTX, were enrolled. Moreover, a prospective study was conducted in which 28 PTX patients were followed up. The degree of anemia was classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the tertiles of hemoglobin (Hb) levels of the anemic CKD patients, with cutoff values of 83 g/L and 102 g/L. Bone metabolic biomarkers, including calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and α-klotho, were tested. RESULTS: The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in CKD patients was 25.7 ± 36.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and 84.10% of CKD patients had anemia. The baseline Hb levels in the mild, moderate, and severe anemia subgroups were 110.86 ± 5.99 g/L, 92.71 ± 5.96 g/L, and 67.38 ± 10.56 g/L, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between CHr and %HYPO parameters and the reticulocyte haemoglobin equivalent (RET-He) and red blood cell haemoglobin equivalent (RBC-He) calculated by the Sysmex XE-2100 haematology analyser in a cohort of 200 dialysis patients referred to the Nephrology Unit of our hospital. Furthermore, we evaluated a new index, the DF-Hypo XE, obtained from haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct) and RET-He, provided by the Sysmex XE-2100, as a new potential marker of %HYPO in dialysed patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples collected in EDTA anticoagulant from 200 CKD patients receiving erythropoietin and iron to maintain haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 mg/dL were analysed on both the Siemens ADVIA 2120 and the Sysmex XE-2100 within 2 h of collection. RESULTS: There was good correlation between CHr and RET-He (r = 0.88; p<0.0001), %HYPO and DF-Hypo XE (r = 0.89; p<0.0001) and between RBC-He and CH (r = 0.96; p<0.0001), but there was a lower correlation, even though statistically significant, between RBC-He and %HYPO (r = -0.59; p<0.0001).

Peginesatide is noninferior to the other ESAs, and has a good safety profile in patients on hemodialysis. The higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events reported in CKD patients not on dialysis in the recent Phase III studies require further, better planned, studies.

The efficacy and safety of molidustat were recently evaluated in three 16-week phase 2b studies. Here, we report the results of two long-term extension studies of molidustat. METHODS: Both studies were parallel-group, open-label, multicenter studies of ≤36 months' duration, in patients with anemia due to CKD, and included an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent as active control. One study enrolled patients not receiving dialysis (n = 164), and the other enrolled patients receiving hemodialysis (n = 88). The primary efficacy variable for both studies was change in blood hemoglobin (Hb) level from baseline to each post-baseline visit, and safety outcomes included adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: In patients not on dialysis, the mean ± SD Hb concentrations at baseline were 11.28 ± 0.55 g/dL for molidustat and 11.08 ± 0.51 g/dL for darbepoetin. The mean ± SD blood Hb concentrations throughout the study (defined as mean of each patient's overall study Hb levels) were 11.10 ± 0.508 and 10.98 ± 0.571 g/dL in patients treated with molidustat and darbepoetin, respectively. Similar proportions of patients reported at least one AE in the molidustat (85.6%) and darbepoetin (85.7%) groups. In patients on dialysis, mean ± SD Hb levels at baseline were 10.40 ± 0.70 and 10.52 ± 0.53 g/dL in the molidustat and epoetin groups, respectively. The mean ± SD blood Hb concentrations during the study were 10.37 ± 0.56 g/dL in the molidustat group and 10.52 ± 0.47 g/dL in the epoetin group. Proportions of patients who reported at least one AE were 91.2% in the molidustat group and 93.3% in the epoetin group. CONCLUSIONS: Molidustat was well tolerated for up to 36 months and appears to be an effective alternative to darbepoetin and epoetin in the long-term management of anemia associated with CKD.","2019","American journal of nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"28774438"," Individualized drug dosing using RBF-Galerkin method: Case of anemia management in chronic kidney disease. ","Mirinejad H. et al.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is frequently associated with decreased physical component of quality of life, as well as adverse cardiovascular events. Current treatment methods for renal anemia are mostly population-based approaches treating individual patients with a one-size-fits-all model. However, FDA recommendations stipulate individualized anemia treatment with precise control of the hemoglobin concentration and minimal drug utilization. In accordance with these recommendations, this work presents an individualized drug dosing approach to anemia management by leveraging the theory of optimal control. METHODS: A Multiple Receding Horizon Control (MRHC) approach based on the RBF-Galerkin optimization method is proposed for individualized anemia management in CKD patients. Recently developed by the authors, the RBF-Galerkin method uses the radial basis function approximation along with the Galerkin error projection to solve constrained optimal control problems numerically. The proposed approach is applied to generate optimal dosing recommendations for individual patients. RESULTS: Performance of the proposed approach (MRHC) is compared in silico to that of a population-based anemia management protocol and an individualized multiple model predictive control method for two case scenarios: hemoglobin measurement with and without observational errors. In silico comparison indicates that hemoglobin concentration with MRHC method has less variation among the methods, especially in presence of measurement errors. In addition, the average achieved hemoglobin level from the MRHC is significantly closer to the target hemoglobin than that of the other two methods, according to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test. Furthermore, drug dosages recommended by the MRHC are more stable and accurate and reach the steady-state value notably faster than those generated by the other two methods. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is highly efficient for the control of hemoglobin level, yet provides accurate dosage adjustments in the treatment of CKD anemia.","2017","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) and is frequently associated with decreased physical component of quality of life , as well as adverse cardiovascular events ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Women aged 18 years or older with CKD were included based on ICD-9-CM codes for CKD, anemia, and reason for visit. Anemia-related medications were retrieved using NAMCS drug codes. RESULTS: Approximately 58 million weighted outpatient visits for women with CKD were made. Nearly 14% of these visits were by Hispanic women and 50% visits were by patients aged 65 years or older. Nephrologists accounted for only 15% of CKD patient visits and 51% of these patients had anemia diagnosis. Additionally, 32% of patients were using 5 or more medications. Women with Medicare coverage were 2.6 times more likely (p < .05) to be diagnosed with anemia by a nephrologist and were 2.4 times more likely (p < .05) to receive a prescription to treat anemia than patients seen by non-nephrologists. Hispanic women were 56% less likely (p < or = .05) to use 5 or more medications than non-Hispanic patients.

However, the risk factors for anemia, including the influence of ethnicity, are not well established among the CKD population in Johannesburg. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 353 adult CKD patients attending the renal outpatient clinic of the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (Johannesburg, South Africa) from June 1, 2016 to December 30, 2016. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained using a proforma. Blood samples were collected for serum electrolytes and hematological parameters. Predictors of low hemoglobin and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were evaluated using multivariable binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The mean age and prevalence of anemia among the CKD participants were 55.3±15.0 years and 43.18% (95% CI: 38.1%-48.4%), respectively. Blacks had the highest prevalence of anemia (46.9%), while Indians/Asians had the lowest (18.2%). Although the odds of anemia was 3.8-fold higher (odds ratio =3.8, P-value =0.059) among CKD stage V participants as compared to CKD stage I, the relationship between anemia and stages of CKD was non-linear. Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio =2.31, P-value =0.005) had a strong association with anemia among the CKD participants. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the CKD participants were anemic, and the odds of anemia did not increase linearly with increasing severity of CKD. There was a marked ethnic disparity in anemia prevalence.

Serum hepcidin is increased by high iron stores, blocks intestinal iron absorption, and impairs storage iron release. Conversely, iron deficiency lowers hepcidin levels and enhances intestinal iron absorption and the release of storage iron. As with ferritin, hepcidin is an acute phase reactant. Consequently, inflammation increases hepcidin and leads to impaired iron absorption, lowers serum iron and transferrin saturation, and contributes to the anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We review the physiology of iron absorption, its relationship to hepcidin and the transmembrane iron transporter ferroportin, the role of hepcidin in CKD related anemia, and the possible diagnostic implications and limitations of using hepcidin as a marker of iron status.","2013","Kidney research and clinical practice"," We review the physiology of iron absorption , its relationship to hepcidin and the transmembrane iron transporter ferroportin , the role of hepcidin in CKD related anemia , and the possible diagnostic implications and limitations of using hepcidin as a marker of iron status ","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This study is designed to assess whether the coexistence of anemia and LVH is independently associated with the rate of renal function decline and increased cardiovascular events in patients with CKD stages 3 to 5. METHODS: This longitudinal study enrolled 415 patients, who were classified into 4 groups according to sex-specific median values of hemoglobin and with/without LVH. The change in renal function was measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate slope. Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular death, hospitalization for unstable angina, nonfatal myocardial infarction, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, transient ischemia attack, and stroke. The relative risk of cardiovascular events was analyzed by Cox's regression method. RESULTS: The estimated glomerular filtration rate slope was significantly lower in the group with lower hemoglobin and LVH than in the other groups (P ≤ 0.031). In addition, patients with lower hemoglobin and LVH were independently associated with increased cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 4.269; 95% confidence interval, 1.402-13.000; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that the coexistence of anemia and LVH was independently associated with faster renal function decline and poor cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD.

","Wilkinson T. et al.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have reduced exercise capacity. Possible contributing factors may include impaired muscle O(2) utilisation through reduced mitochondria number and/or function slowing the restoration of muscle ATP concentrations via oxidative phosphorylation. Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we explored changes in skeletal muscle haemoglobin/myoglobin O(2) saturation (SMO(2)%) during exercise. METHODS: 24 CKD patients [58.3 (± 16.5) years, eGFR 56.4 (± 22.3) ml/min/1.73 m(2)] completed the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) as a marker of exercise capacity. Using NIRS, SMO(2)% was measured continuously before, during, and after (recovery) exercise. Exploratory differences were investigated between exercise capacity tertiles in CKD, and compared with six healthy controls. RESULTS: We identified two discrete phases; a decline in SMO(2)% during incremental exercise, followed by rapid increase upon cessation (recovery). Compared to patients with low exercise capacity [distance walked during ISWT, 269.0 (± 35.9) m], patients with a higher exercise capacity [727.1 (± 38.1) m] took 45% longer to reach their minimum SMO(2)% (P = .038) and recovered (half-time recovery) 79% faster (P = .046). Compared to controls, CKD patients took significantly 56% longer to recover (i.e., restore SMO(2)% to baseline, full recovery) (P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Using NIRS, we have determined for the first time in CKD, that favourable SMO(2)% kinetics (slower deoxygenation rate, quicker recovery) are associated with greater exercise capacity. These dysfunctional kinetics may indicate reduced mitochondria capacity to perform oxidative phosphorylation-a process essential for carrying out even simple activities of daily living. Accordingly, NIRS may provide a simple, low cost, and non-invasive means to evaluate muscle O(2) kinetics in CKD.","2019","Clinical and experimental nephrology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

HgbA(1C) was measured as clinically indicated and its relationship with random blood glucose (RBG) measurement evaluated prospectively over up to 10 years in three groups (end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CKD and controls who had diabetes but no CKD). RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2011, in the control group, glycemic control as assessed by HgbA(1C) was stable but improved when assessed by RBG. However, both the CKD and ESRD groups experienced declines in RBG and HgbA(1C). Declining HgbA(1C) and RBG were noted prior to onset of dialysis. A fall in HgbA(1C) remained after adjustment for RBG. A strong inverse relationship was seen between CKD stage and HgbA(1C) even after adjusting for RBG such that the relationship between RBG levels and HgbA(1C) was modified by CKD. CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic patients with late-stage CKD, glycemic control shows an improvement. However, HgbA(1C) <7% may overestimate the degree of glycemic control.

While glucose-lowering therapy targeting glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <7% is proven to reduce the risk of developing DKD, its effects on complications of DKD are unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of HbA1c with risks of progression to ESKD and death within a clinic-based study of CKD. We hypothesized that higher HbA1c concentrations would be associated with increased risks of ESKD and death. DESIGN AND SETTING: We studied 618 participants from the Seattle Kidney Study (mean eGFR 42 ml/min), 308 of whom had diabetes, and tested associations of baseline HbA1c with time to a composite outcome of initiation of renal replacement therapy or death. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 4.2 years, there were 343 instances of the composite outcome (11.5 per 100 person-years). Among participants with diabetes, in both crude and adjusted analyses, higher HbA1c levels (examined continuously or categorically) were not associated with the risk of the composite outcome (HR (95% CI): 0.99 (0.88, 1.10) per 1% additional HbA1c, p = 0.79). HbA1c was not associated with ESKD or mortality when the outcomes were examined separately, nor when stratified between insulin users and non-users. CONCLUSION: In a referred population of established DKD, higher HbA1c was not associated with higher risk of ESKD or death.

It is also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and diminished quality of life. Often, patients with CKD of different stages require erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to maintain their hemoglobin (Hb) within the target range. Darbepoetin alfa is a newer ESA with a longer half-life than recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO). The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety profile of twice-monthly (Q2W) and once a month (1QM) darbepoetin alfa in CKD patients, not on dialysis. The secondary objective was to assess the appropriate dose conversion from EPO to darbepoetin. Patients with CKD not on dialysis, receiving darbepoetin alfa every other week, or once every month, and with stable Hb levels between 10 and 12 g/dL, were enrolled in this single-center, open-label, single-arm study. In this study, 36 patients (21 female, 15 male) were enrolled with a mean age of 46.4 ± 20.12 years. About 56% of the patients (n = 20) received darbepoetin alfa 40 μg Q2W for more than three months and 36% (n = 13) were on once-monthly doses, whereas the other 8% (n = 3) were on variable doses ranging from 20 to 60 μg every two weeks.

We evaluated whether intensity of epoetin therapy affects Hb variability and renal survival in nondialysis CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We calculated the individual therapeutic index (TI) for epoetin (EPO; difference between rates of visits that required EPO dosage change and those with effective EPO change) from 1198 visits during the first year of EPO in 137 patients. Renal death was registered in the subsequent 18.1 mo. Analysis was made by TI tertile (lower, middle, and higher; i.e., from more to less intensive therapy). RESULTS: Main features and visit number were similar in tertiles. Lower Hb response to first EPO dosage was an independent predictor of higher TI (P = 0.002). The area under the curve for Hb (11.56 +/- 0.87, 11.46 +/- 1.20, and 10.95 +/- 1.48 g/dl per yr; P = 0.040) decreased from lower to higher tertile. Hb variability increased in parallel, as shown by the reduction of time with Hb at target (time in target, from 9.2 +/- 2.0 to 3.0 +/- 2.2 mo; P < 0.0001) and the wider values of within-patient Hb standard deviation (from 0.70 to 0.96; P = 0.005) and Hb fluctuations across target (P < 0.0001).

Despite the association of IDA with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, it remains underdiagnosed and poorly managed. Up to 70% of patients with CKD are anaemic at the time of initiating dialysis, while the predictors of IDA in these patients in our setting are unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for IDA in patients with CKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a case-control study of 157 patients with CKD and 157 age and gender matched subjects without CKD. Information obtained from the participants were socio-demographic details, aetiology of CKD, medication history and features of IDA. All participants had serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TSAT), highly sensitive C-reactive protein, serum creatinine and complete blood count determined. RESULTS: The median estimated glomerular rate (22.7 [3.4-59.5] vs. 110.2 [60.3-152.8] ml/min/1.73 m(2), P < 0.01), the mean haemoglobin concentration (9.3 ± 2.6 vs. 11.4 ± 1.7 g/dl, P < 0.01), and TSAT (27.9% ± 6.4% vs. 34.8% ± 8.1%, P < 0.04) were significantly lower in patients with CKD.

","de F. et al.","The availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has revolutionized the treatment of anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, maintaining patients at haemoglobin (Hb) levels that are both safe and provide maximal benefit is a continuing challenge in the field. Based on emerging data on the potential risks of Hb treatment targets >13 g/dL, treatment targets have recently been lowered. In the latest revision (March 2008) of the European product labelling for the ESA class of drugs, the target treatment range was lowered to 10-12 g/dL. Fluctuation of Hb levels or 'Hb variability' during treatment with ESAs is a well-documented phenomenon. Hb levels that are either too high or too low may have an adverse effect on patient outcomes; thus, it is important to understand the causes of Hb variability in order to achieve optimal treatment. Several factors are believed to contribute to variation in the Hb level, including patient comorbidities and intercurrent events. Inflammation is also an important factor associated with Hb variability, and the consequences of persistent inflammatory activity are far-reaching in affected patients. This review addresses the complex role of inflammation in chronic kidney disease, as evidenced by the apparent state of deranged inflammatory markers. The mechanisms by which inflammatory cytokines may affect the response to ESAs, the development of anaemia and poor treatment outcomes are also examined. In addition, various options for intervention to enhance the response to ESAs in haemodialysis patients with inflammation are considered.","2009","NDT plus",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Hazard ratio and confidence interval (CI) for mortality with a combination of eGFR and anemia were calculated. After matching using propensity score (PS) for anemia, survival analysis between anemic and non-anemic people, independent from some variables, including eGFR, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 828 (1.3%) participants died (non-anemic vs. anemic, 1.2 vs. 2.3%, p < 0.01). Multivariable Cox analysis showed that, independent of eGFR levels, anemic people had significantly higher mortality.

","Maurin N.","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are exposed to extremely higher risks of atherothrombotic complications of the cardio- and cerebrovascular systems. In pertinent meta-analyses, overviews, editorials and comments, it has been considered unproven, on the basis of current data from randomized controlled trials, that a higher hemoglobin (Hb) value provides overall-survival benefits for CKD. At present, there is a ""gray zone"" between the intervention threshold of Hb < 9 g/dl and an Hb level > 13 g/dl, at which CKD is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. This paper discusses in depth the hemostaseological hypothesis of increased mortality as a result of higher Hb levels during treatment of renal anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). It seems to be clearly evident that ESA activate platelets directly and indirectly, and that pathologically extended bleeding time is normalized when an Hb level of 10 g/dl is reached; from the hemostaseological perspective, a threshold level for treatment of renal anemia with ESA is thus defined. According to the present state of knowledge, an Hb target range of 10-11 g/dl seems reasonable for renal anemia; this is also compatible with current recommendations by ESA producers and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This target range avoids the upper and lower risk levels for Hb, and probably ensures a positive ESA effect on quality of life; it is much more cost-efficient than the target range of 11-12 g/dl recommended by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) in 2007.","2008","Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",,"Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Cichota L. et al.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent, with increasing numbers of patients affected by the disease world-wide, and anemia is a common finding in patients with CKD. Anemia impacts negatively on cardiovascular disease, exercise capacity, and quality of life, resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of ischemia-modified albumin and lactate in patients with established anemia associated with CKD and its correlations with hemoglobin levels. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, iron, ferritin, albumin, creatinine, lactate, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) were measured in 17 patients with established anemia associated to CKD and 19 controls by standard methods. The results of hematocrit, hemoglobin, iron, and albumin were lower in the anemia group than in the control group. Ferritin, creatinine, and lactate levels were higher in anemia of the CKD group than the control group. IMA increase in the anemia group (0.8115+/-0.1304 absorbance units [ABSU]) compared to control (0.4951+/-0.0393 ABSU). Significant correlations between IMA and lactate, IMA and hemoglobin, IMA and creatinine, and hemoglobin and lactate were observed. IMA and lactate increase during anemia and this elevation could be associated to hypoxia due to low hemoglobin levels. However, our data suggest that lactate is more sensitive to anemia compared to IMA.","2008","Journal of clinical laboratory analysis"," The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of ischemia-modified albumin and lactate in patients with established anemia associated with CKD and its correlations with hemoglobin levels ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

We sought to determine whether higher phosphorus levels are associated with anemia in a large diverse population without CKD and early CKD. METHODS: This study is a historical population-based study within the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system (1 January 1998 to 31 December 2013) among individuals aged 18 years and older with estimated glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and measurements of serum phosphorus, creatinine and hemoglobin. Individuals were excluded if they had secondary causes of anemia. Odds ratio (OR) estimated for moderate anemia defined as hemoglobin <11 g/dL for both sexes. Mild anemia was defined as <12 g/dL (females) and <13 g/dL (males). RESULTS: Among 155 974 individuals, 4.1% had moderate anemia and 12.9% had mild anemia. Serum phosphorus levels ≥3.5 mg/dL were associated with both mild and moderate anemia. Moderate anemia OR (95% confidence interval) was 1.16 (1.04-1.29) for every 0.5 mg/dL phosphorus increase and 1.26 (1.07-1.48) in the highest versus middle phosphorus tertile. Additional independent anemia risk factors, including female sex, Asian race, diabetes, low albumin and low iron saturation, were observed, but did not alter the anemia-phosphorus association.

","Nalado A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common presenting feature among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it is associated with poor clinical outcomes and quality of life. It is not clear if growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) or hepcidin are useful as early markers of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) among non-dialysis CKD patients. We therefore evaluated the diagnostic validity of GDF-15 and hepcidin as biomarkers of IDA among non-dialysis CKD patients in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHOD: An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted among non-dialysis CKD patients (n = 312) and apparently healthy controls (n = 184) from June to December 2016 at an Academic Hospital, in Johannesburg, South Africa. An interviewer administered proforma was used to obtain the socio-biological and clinical characteristics of the participants. Serum levels of GDF-15 and hepcidin were determined. Predictive logistic regression models were built and post estimation receiver operator characteristics were determined to evaluate diagnostic validity of hepcidin and GDF-15 for absolute and functional iron deficiency anaemia. RESULTS: About half (50.6%) of the participants were female while the participants' mean age was 49.7 ± 15.8 years. The predictive value of diagnosing absolute IDA among CKD patients using GDF-15 was 74.02% (95% CI: 67.62-80.42%) while the predictive value of diagnosing functional IDA among CKD patients using hepcidin was 70.1% (95% CI: 62.79-77.49%).There was a weak negative correlation between hepcidin levels and GFR (r = - 0.19, p = 0.04) in anaemic CKD patients, and between serum GDF-15 and haemoglobin (r = - 0.34, p = 0.001). Serum ferritin (β = 0.00389, P-value< 0.001), was a predictor of log hepcidin.

","Okuturlar Y. et al.","OBJECTIVE: Altered paraoxonase (PON) and arylesterase (ARE) activities have been shown in anemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and in iron deficiency anemia (IDA) patients. Whether accompanying anemia alone is responsible for this diminished PON and ARE activities in CKD patients or an additive factor for this is not well studied. Therefore, we tried to clarify this issue here. METHODS: A total of 82 subjects that consisted of 19 patients with IDA (group 1), 23 anemic CKD patients (group 2), and 40 age and sex matched healthy subjects (group 3) were enrolled. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), serum total thiol (-SH), PON, and ARE activities of the participants were analyzed. RESULTS: Group 2 patients had significantly lowest serum levels of Total -SH, PON and ARE. Further comparison showed that total -SH, PON and ARE levels were lower in group 1 than group 3 (p = 0.0001 in both). Regarding comparison of group 1 and 2, only serum ARE levels were significantly lower in group 2 (p = 0.001). PON activity was not different between group 1 and group 2 whereas ARE activity was lower in group 2 than groups 1 and 3. In addition, correlation analysis showed that CIMT was negatively correlated with PON and ARE. CONCLUSIONS: This markedly decreased ARE activity in CKD patients, which could not be explained by the anemia alone, may have a role in the pathogenesis of increased atherosclerosis in such patients.

","Choi Y. et al.","AIMS: Phosphate-lowering effects of ferric citrate were reported in several clinical trials, but mostly in small-scale studies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy and safety of ferric citrate in controlling hyperphosphataemia and iron-deficiency anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical trials that enrolled CKD patients receiving ferric citrate for hyperphosphataemia. Two investigators performed systematic literature search to identify eligible studies, evaluated risk of bias and extracted relevant data. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Phosphate-lowering effects of ferric citrate were greater compared to no active treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -1.15; P < 0.001) and comparable to other phosphate binders (SMD = 0.03; P = 0.61). Calcium concentrations post ferric citrate treatment did not differ compared to no active treatment (SMD = 0.15; P = 0.21) but were significantly lower compared to other phosphate binders (SMD = -0.14; P = 0.01). These led to significant reductions in calcium-phosphorus product with ferric citrate versus no active control (SMD = -1.02; P < 0.001) but no difference versus active control (SMD = -0.01; P = 0.93). Intact parathyroid hormone showed no substantial between-group difference in both comparison against no active and active controls. Ferric citrate improved iron stores and anaemia parameters, but increased risk of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and discoloured faeces. CONCLUSION: Ferric citrate was effective in lowering phosphorus and phosphorus-calcium product versus no active treatment and had comparable effects versus other phosphate binders. Calcium levels were significantly lower with ferric citrate than with other phosphate-lowering treatment.

","Besarab A. et al.","Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) clearly indicate a possible cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk when deliberately targeting a normal hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 13 to 15 g/dL. By contrast, observational studies point to greater hospitalization and mortality at Hb levels <11 g/dL. There are no direct data to help us determine where, within this broad range, the optimal Hb lies. In RCTs and observational studies, significant confounding from the interrelationships of anemia and epoetin resistance occurs in patients with a serious illness. Patients with comorbidities such as malnutrition and inflammatory processes are more resistant to epoetin and, invariably, require greater cumulative epoetin doses. The effect of a higher erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose on increasing mortality has been noted repeatedly in post hoc analyses of RCTs. It is therefore too simplistic to solely attribute the outcomes achieved in RCTs to ""target Hb."" We discuss various mechanisms for potential harm at higher Hb levels as opposed to those that may be obtained from higher epoetin doses. For the individual patient, the therapeutic decision should center on what Hb is most appropriate at a ""safe"" ESA dose.

In line with it, the administration of vitamin D or its analogues has been associated with an improvement of anemia. There are no data, however, about a direct effect of paricalcitol on hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine whether paricalcitol, compared to calcitriol, improves anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: In this randomized trial 60 CKD patients stage 3b-5 and anemia (Hb levels: 10-12.5 g/dL) were assigned (1:1) to receive low doses of calcitriol (Group Calcitriol) or paricalcitol (Group Paricalcitol) for 6 months. All the patients had normal values of plasma calcium, phosphorus and PTH, a stable iron balance, and normal values of C-Reactive Protein. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the effects of the two treatments on Hb levels; the modifications in 24hr-proteinuria (UProt) were also evaluated. RESULTS: A significant Group x Time interaction effect was observed in the longitudinal analysis of Hb levels (F(1,172)=31.4, p<0.001). Subjects in Paricalcitol experienced a significant monthly increase of Hb levels equal to +0.16 g/dL [95% C.I. 0.10 to +0.22, p<0.001) while in Group Calcitriol, Hb decrease throughout the follow-up with an average monthly rate of -0.10 g/dL (95% C.I.: -0.17 to -0.04, p<0.001). In Group Paricalcitol, UProt was significantly reduced after 6 months [0.35 (0.1-1.2) vs 0.59 (0.2-1.6), p<0.01], whereas no significant difference emerged in Group Calcitriol. Plasma levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH and of inflammation markers remained in the normal range in both groups throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to paricalcitol results in an independent increase in Hb levels, which occurred with no modification of iron balance, inflammatory markers, and PTH plasma concentrations, and was associated with a decrease in UProt.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the influence of fluid status on hemoglobin concentrations and the cardiovascular and renal outcomes in a prospective cohort of 326 patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Fluid status, as defined by overhydration (OH) level measured with bioimpedance, was negatively correlated with hemoglobin concentrations at baseline (r=-0.438, P<0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, OH remained an independent predictor of hemoglobin, second only to estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: no anemia (n=105), true anemia (n=82), and anemia with excess OH (n=139) (relative OH level ≥7%, the 90th percentile for the healthy population). During a median follow-up of 2.2 years, there was no difference in cardiovascular and renal risks between patients with true anemia and those with no anemia in the adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. However, patients with anemia with excess OH had a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and CKD progression relative to those with true anemia and those with no anemia, respectively.

The majority of studies on anemia, inflammation, and disturbances of iron metabolism have focused on patients in end-stage renal failure and dialysis therapy. However, anemia and inflammation are present in patients in previous stages of renal failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of inflammatory activity on erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in CKD patients without dialytic treatment. METHODS: 114 CKD adult patients were studied. Patients with anemia (n = 72) were compared with those without anemia (n = 46). Anemic patients were classified as renal anemia (n = 46) or iron deficiency anemia (n = 26). In addition the total group was analyzed according to the degree of renal dysfunction. Iron status, erythropoiesis activity (soluble transferrin receptor and erythropoietin determinations), and inflammatory activity (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-lp, and neopterin determinations) were measured using commercial kits. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-Y) was also determined. RESULTS: Interleukin-6, interleukin-li, and neopterin concentrations were higher in the anemic group when compared with those without anemia and controls. There was no difference in C-reactive protein values between CKD with and without anemia, although both of them had showed elevated levels when compared with controls. Ret-Y values were lower in iron deficiency anemia when compared with renal anemia and controls. An inverse correlation between interleukin-6 and hemoglobin (r = -0.4287, p= 0.0002) was observed only in the renal anemia group. It was observed that anemia has a tendency to worsen as renal function deteriorates. Reticulocyte count was lower and neopterin concentrations were higher in more advanced renal failure stages. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory factors contribute to anemia in renal patients in all stages of renal failure. High levels of neopterin in CKD patients suggest that neopterin contributes to impaired erythropoietin production and anemia in CKD patients.","2012","Clinical laboratory"," The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of inflammatory activity on erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in CKD patients without dialytic treatment ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Subsequently, to compare and evaluate the relationship of serum EPO, sFas levels with anemia, and outcomes in patients with NDD-CKD over a long follow-up period. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study in 58 NDD-CKD patients compared with 20 healthy subjects on complete blood count, kidney function, serum EPO, sFas, and inflammatory markers (CRP, IL- 6, and IFN-γ) at baseline. We then compared the same baseline data between patients with NDD-CKD who evolved to anemia and those who did not have anemia over the follow-up. We also evaluated the frequency of outcomes in patients with CKD with higher sFas levels. Finally, we performed a multivariate analysis of factors associated with CKD anemia. RESULTS: There were lower eGFR and Hb but higher serum inflammatory markers, sFas levels, sFas/eGFR, and EPO/Hb ratios in patients with NDD-CKD. Comparatively, on the other hand, NDD-CKD patients with anemia had lower eGFR but were older, had more diabetes, and had higher sFas/ eGFR, EPO/Hb ratios, and serum levels of IL-6 and sFas than NDD-CKD without anemia for an extended period. In addition, there was an association in a multivariate analysis of diabetes, age, and sFas levels with kidney anemia. Furthermore, there were higher frequencies of outcomes in increased serum sFas levels.

METHODS: We included 4604 incident HD patients from 21 countries in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study Phases 4-5 (2009-15). Because low Hgb at HD start may reflect comorbidity or ESA hyporesponse, we restricted our analysis to the 80% of patients who achieved Hgb ≥10 g/dL 91-120 days after HD start (Month 4). RESULTS: About 53% of these patients had Hgb <10 g/dL in Month 1 (<30 days after HD start); they were younger with a similar comorbidity profile (versus Hgb ≥10 g/dL). Month 1 Hgb was associated with first-year HD mortality (adjusted hazard ratio for 1 g/dL higher Hgb was 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.97), despite minimal differences in Month 4 Hgb. Patients with lower Hgb in Month 1 received higher doses of ESA, but not IV iron, over the first 3 months of HD. Results were consistent when excluding catheter users or adjusting for IV iron and ESA dose over the first 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Even among patients with Hgb ≥10 g/dL 3 months later, anemia at HD initiation was common and associated with elevated mortality. A more proactive approach to anemia management in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) may thus improve survival on HD, though long-term prospective studies of non-dialysis CKD patients are needed.","2020","Clinical kidney journal",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CKD patients were classified into two groups. Patients on CCBs treatment (103 patients) and patients not using CCBs (104 patients) were compared cross-sectionally regarding clinical findings, complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry and regular medication use. Patients with polycystic kidney disease, comorbidities that could influence CBC other than iron deficiency of obscure origin, patients receiving RRT, erythropoietin (EPO), vitamin D, phosphate binders and drugs that could influence CBC were excluded. Under dependent variable of CCB use, all significantly different independent variables were subjected to multivariate binary logistic regression analysis (MBLRA). RESULTS: Lower hemoglobin, lower bilirubinemia, higher serum EPO, higher systolic blood pressure were observed in CCB users. Two groups were similar concerning age, gender, BMI, CKD etiology, CKD stage, pretibial edema prevalence, cardiothoracic index, diastolic blood pressure, corrected reticulocyte count, BUN, creatinine, eGFR, proBNP, parathormone, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorous, corrected calcemia, sCRP, relative EPO deficiency and prevalence of relative EPO deficient patients.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study enrolling ESA-naïve CKD subjects with baseline hemoglobin (Hb) < 11.0 g/dL. Q2W darbepoetin alfa treatment was initiated at a dose of 0.75 microg/kg and titrated to achieve and maintain Hb levels at 11.0-13.0 g/dL. Treatment was administered from week 1 to week 19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved Hb > or = 11 g/dL at any study visit, except in week 1. Hb levels, darbepoetin alfa dose, and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 128 subjects who received at least one dose of darbepoetin alfa and of the subjects who completed the study, 118 (92%) and 112 (97%), respectively, achieved a Hb > or = 11 g/dL in a median time of 5 weeks.

","Dahl N. et al.","OBJECTIVE: Ferumoxytol has demonstrated superior efficacy compared with oral iron in treating iron deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, an economic evaluation of ferumoxytol has not been conducted. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of treating iron deficiency anemia in adult non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with ferumoxytol as compared with oral iron, alone or in combination with erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs). METHODS: A decision analytic model compared health outcomes and costs associated with 5-week outpatient treatment of adult non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with ferumoxytol or oral iron, each as monotherapy or in combination with ESAs in the USA. Direct costs include the following: drug acquisition and administration, adverse events, and medical management. Efficacy was determined as mean increase in hemoglobin (g/dL) from baseline over the 5-week period. Clinical inputs were derived from patient-level data from two Phase III randomized controlled trials of ferumoxytol vs. oral iron in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, and cost inputs from RED BOOK™ and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify cost drivers and assess the stability of results. RESULTS: The 5-week treatment cost was $2,489, $5,216, $1,298, and $4,263 per patient for ferumoxytol, ferumoxytol with ESAs, oral iron, and oral iron with ESAs, respectively. The corresponding incremental costs per g/dL increase in hemoglobin, relative to ferumoxytol alone, were $398, $3,558, and $4,768 per patient. Efficacy was the main driver of cost-effectiveness for all treatments. Adverse event and medical management costs were the principal drivers of oral iron monotherapy costs, while drug acquisition substantially contributed to the overall cost for the remaining treatments. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ferumoxytol is a cost-effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients over a 5-week period compared with oral iron with or without ESAs.

Patients with hemoglobin concentrations above the cohort median of 11.6 g/dl were found to have significant reductions in flow-mediated dilatation compared to those below the median. This inverse relationship remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders, including insulin sensitivity, glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, body mass index, serum urate, etiology of underlying renal disease, treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs, and traditional Framingham risk factors.

Linear and binominal regression models were used to describe trends across three predefined time periods (2008-09, 2010-11 and 2012-13). RESULTS: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) use decreased over time among both CKD-ND and HD patients [risk ratio (RR) 2012-13 compared with 2008-09 for CKD-ND 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96; RR for HD 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.97]. Mean ESA dose decreased significantly among HD patients (7% in 2010-11 compared with 2008-09 and another 3% during 2012-13). Over the time periods studied, ESA doses increased slightly in the CKD-ND population. Mean haemoglobin (Hb) levels decreased in CKD-ND patients, among both ESA users and non-users, whereas it decreased to a lesser degree, albeit significantly, among HD ESA users. The risk of having an Hb >120 g/L decreased, especially between 2008-09 and 2010-11. Iron use increased over time, mainly in the HD population, but also among CKD-ND ESA non-users.

Patient demographics were noted, and laboratory values for creatinine, hemoglobin and iron stores were recorded pre- and post-dose. TDI diluted in normal saline was administered intravenously over 4-6 hours after an initial test dose. One hundred fifty-three patients received a total of 250 doses of TDI (mean ± SD=971 ± 175 mg); age was 69 ± 12 years and creatinine 3.3 ± 1.9 mg/dL. All stages of CKD were represented (stage 4 commonest). Hemoglobin and iron stores improved post-TDI (P<0.001). None of the patients experienced an anaphylactic reaction or death. Adverse events (AEs) were noted in 8 out of 250 administered doses (3.2%). The most common AEs were itching, chills and back pain. One hundred and ten doses of high molecular weight (HMW) iron dextran produced 6 AEs (5.45%), whereas 140 doses of low molecular weight (LMW) iron dextran produced 2 AEs (1.43%), a non-significant trend (P=0.1433 by Fishers Exact Test). Iron dextran TDI is relatively safe and effective in correcting IDA in geriatric CKD patients. Fewer AEs were noted with the LMW compared to the HMW product. LMW iron dextran given as TDI can save both cost and time, helping to alleviate issues of non-compliance and patient scheduling.","2014","Renal failure",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

In most trials, patients received either FCM doses of < or = 1000 mg, administered intravenously (i.v.) over < or = 15 min. or oral ferrous sulfate (FeSulf) 325 mg (65 mg iron), three times daily (t.i.d.), or 304 mg (100 mg iron), twice daily (b.i.d.). In one trial, patients on HD received 200 mg i.v. of either FCM or iron sucrose (ISC), two-to-three times weekly. In a pilot study in patients with CHF and CKD, patients received 200 mg of FCM by push injection compared with 200 mg of ISC slow injection. FCM was usually administered until the patient's calculated total iron replacement dose was achieved. Treatment with FCM improved indices of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb], ferritin and transferrin saturation [TSAT] values). In patients on HD with IDA secondary to CKD, FCM demonstrated comparable efficacy to ISC in achieving an increase in Hb. In patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than with FeSulf. Patients with PPA receiving FCM compared with those receiving oral iron achieved an Hb rise > or = 2.0 g/dl earlier (7 days compared with 14 days; p < 0.001), were more likely to achieve an Hb rise > or = 3.0 g/dl at any time beginning at day 14 (86.3% compared with 60.4%; p < 0.001), and achieve an Hb > 12.0 g/dl at the end of the study (Day 42; 90.5% compared with 68.6%, p < 0.01).

The aim of this study was to investigate relationship between hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) levels and echocardiographic findings in these patients. METHODS: The study included 61 patients with CKD stage IV-V (34 male, mean age 62.6 ± 13.6 years) and 22 age- and sex -matched healthy persons as control group. All participants underwent clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic examination, including Tissue Doppler Imaging and colour M-mode Doppler. RESULTS: Patients with CKD had lower Hb levels (p<0.001), and higher levels of NT-proBNP (p<0.001) than healthy controls. Patients were divided into two groups according to their mean Hb levels: group A, Hb<10.3 g/dL and group B, Hb≥10.3 g/dL. Patients from group A was significantly older (p<0.001), left ventricular mass index was significantly higher (LVMI, p<0.001), LV diastolic function was worse (septal and lateral E'/A' ratio: p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively), and the level NT-proBNP was higher (p<0.001) compared to patients from group B. The natural logarithm of NT-proBNP (lnNT-proBNP) showed highly significant correlation with Hb (p<0.001) and significant correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (p=0.035) in CKD patients.

The admission laboratory tests and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 2728 form were examined to determine the prevalence of erythropoietin use, anemia (Hb<11 g/dl), and iron deficiency (ferritin<100 ng/ml and transferrin saturation %<20%). In a second part of the study, the effect of intravenous iron gluconate replacement in patients with stage III & IV chronic kidney disease was examined. Anemia was present in 68% of all patients starting hemodialysis. Iron deficiency was a common feature occurring in 29% of patients taking erythropoietin (49% of all patients) and 26% of patients without erythropoietin (51% of all patients).

All adult non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients who met the inclusion (GFR>15mL/min/1.73m(2)) and exclusion criteria and provided consent were systematically recruited over a 4-week inclusion period. Investigators were asked to perform a blood test (hemoglobin concentration, serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation) and to complete a questionnaire about their iron status monitoring practices. The primary objective was to assess the prevalence of iron deficiency (serum ferritin<100μg/L and/or transferrin saturation<20%). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the prevalence of absolute iron deficiency (serum ferritin<100μg/L and transferrin saturation<20%) and functional iron deficiency (serum ferritin≥100μg/L and transferrin saturation<20%), the prevalence of iron deficiency according to haemoglobin concentration and chronic kidney disease stage, the proportion of centres that perform routine evaluation of iron status and the number of patients receiving iron supplementation.

","Aizawa K. et al.","BACKGROUND: Epoetin beta pegol (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator; C.E.R.A.) is currently widely used for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therapeutic control of anemia is assessed by monitoring haemoglobin (Hb) levels. However, certain qualitative aspects of erythrocytes are also impaired in CKD, including loss of deformability and shortened life-span. Therefore, monitoring Hb alone could potentially fail to reveal pathological changes in erythrocytes. Focusing on erythrocyte quality in CKD may lead to more effective anemia therapy with C.E.R.A. METHODS: A CKD rat model was induced by uninephrectomy followed by anti-Thy1.1 antibody injection. From 5 weeks after the operation, C.E.R.A. (0.6 μg/kg) or vehicle was administered every 2 weeks. Erythrocyte deformability was quantified with ektacytometry and erythrocyte turnover was estimated by biotin labeling. Intracellular calcium level was assessed by Fluo-3/AM. RESULTS: Erythrocyte deformability progressively declined in CKD rats. Furthermore, erythrocyte turnover in the circulation drastically accelerated in CKD rats. With administration of C.E.R.A. at a dose sufficient to adequately control Hb, deterioration of erythrocyte deformability and turnover in CKD rats were significantly improved. Intracellular calcium, which plays a pivotal role in the mediation of erythrocyte quality, was significantly increased in CKD and was normalized by C.E.R.A. CONCLUSION: C.E.R.A. treatment exerted a favorable effect not only on anemia but also on the improvement of erythrocyte quality. C.E.R.A. administered for the treatment of CKD-associated anemia may confer therapeutic benefits on erythrocytes.","2018","BMC nephrology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The aim of this study was to define the onset of anemia of renal origin and its association with the evolution of kidney disease and clinical outcomes in stage 3 CKD (CKD-3). METHODS: This epidemiological, prospective, multicenter, 3-year study included 439 CKD-3 patients. The origin of nephropathy and comorbidity (Charlson score: 3.2) were recorded. The clinical characteristics of patients that developed anemia according to EBPG guidelines were compared with those that did not, followed by multivariate logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier curves and ROC curves to investigate factors associated with the development of renal anemia. RESULTS: During the 36-month follow-up period, 50% reached CKD-4 or 5, and approximately 35% were diagnosed with anemia (85% of renal origin). The probability of developing renal anemia was 0.12, 0.20 and 0.25 at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. Patients that developed anemia were mainly men (72% anemic vs. 69% non-anemic). The mean age was 68 vs. 65.5 years and baseline proteinuria was 0.94 vs. 0.62 g/24h (anemic vs. non anemic, respectively). Baseline MDRD values were 36 vs. 40 mL/min and albumin 4.1 vs. 4.3 g/dL; reduction in MDRD was greater in those that developed anemia (6.8 vs. 1.6 mL/min/1.73 m2/3 years). These patients progressed earlier to CKD-4 or 5 (18 vs. 28 months), with a higher proportion of hospitalizations (31 vs. 16%), major CV events (16 vs. 7%), and higher mortality (10 vs. 6.6%) than those without anemia.

,"24381864"," Renal Cell Protection of Erythropoietin beyond Correcting The Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients. ","Nasri H.","Currently many patients with chronic renal failure have profited from the use of erythropoietin to correct anemia (1,2). In chronic kidney disease, anemia is believed to be a surrogate index for tissue hypoxia that continues preexisting renal tissue injury (1-3). Erythropoietin is an essential glycoprotein that accelerates red blood cell maturation from erythroid progenitors and facilitates erythropoiesis. It is a 30.4 kD glycoprotein and class I cytokine containing 165 amino acids (3,4). Approximately 90% of systemic erythropoietin in adults is produced by peritubular interstitial fibroblasts in the renal cortex and outer medulla of the kidney (3-5). A feedback mechanism involving oxygen delivery to the tissues seems to regulate erythropoietin production. Hypoxia-inducible factor regulates transcription of the erythropoietin gene in the kidney, which determines erythropoietin synthesis (3-5). Erythropoietin is an essential glycoprotein that accelerates red blood cell maturation from erythroid progenitors and mediates erythropoiesis in the bone marrow (4-6). Kidney fibrosis is the last common pathway in chronic renal failure irrespective of the initial etiology (5,6). Constant inflammatory cell infiltration and pericyte-myofibroblast transition lead to renal fibrosis and insufficiency which result in decreased production of erythropoietin (4-7). Thus far, therapeutic efforts to treat patients with chronic renal failure by administering erythropoietin have been made only to correct anemia and putative hypoxic tissue damage. The introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin has marked a significant advance in the management of anemia associated with chronic renal failure (6-9). With an increasing number of patients with chronic renal failure receiving erythropoietin treatment, emerging evidence suggests that erythropoietin not only has an erythropoietic function, but also has renoprotective potential. In fact, in recent years, the additional non-erythropoietic tissue/ organ protective efficacy of erythropoietin has become evident, especially in the kidneys (5-12). Various investigations have shown the kidney protective property of erythropoietin in acute kidney injury. In a study to evaluate the ameliorative effects of erythropoietin on renal tubular cells, we studied 40 male rats. We found that erythropoietin was able to prevent the increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Furthermore, co-administration of gentamicin and erythropoietin effectively reduced kidney tissue damage compared to the control group. However, the protective properties of erythropoietin were also evident in our study. When the drug was applied after gentamicin- induced tubular damage we were able to show that the drug was still effective after tissue injury onset. This indicates that erythropoietin may have curative effects in addition to its preventive properties (13). Thus, erythropoietin is a promising kidney protective agent to prevent, ameliorate or attenuate tubular damage induced by gentamicin or other nephrotoxic agents that act in a similar manner to this drug (14-17). Recent studies have elucidated the cellular mechanism involved in kidney erythropoietin production and the consequent events that lead to kidney fibrosis, showing that they are closely related to each other (18-20). In contrast to previous findings, fibroblasts originating from damaged renal tubular epithelial cells do not have an important role in kidney fibrosis, but renal erythropoietin- producing cells, stemming from neural crests, have been shown to trans-differentiate into myofibroblasts after long-term exposure to inflammatory situations related to kidney fibrosis. In fact, almost all myofibroblasts expressing α-smooth muscle actin originate from renal erythropoietin-producing cells, which are naturally peritubular interstitial fibroblastic cells expressing neural cell marker genes but not α-smooth muscle actin. Macrophages and myofibroblasts are responsible for fibrosis in the renal tissue. Macrophages could be differentiated to phenotype M1 (classically activated) or M2 (wound healing) according to the distinctive cytokine production and behavior that follows different routes of activation (6,8,21,22). While erythropoietin can disengage macrophages by stopping the activity of NF-κB, it is possible that one of the mechanisms explaining the antifibrotic effects of erythropoietin in chronic kidney disease is in vivo macrophage regulation (20-25). These important findings stipulate the missing link in chronic renal failure between anemia and kidney fibrosis (6,8,21,22). In patients with chronic kidney disease, anemia due to reduced erythropoietin production eventually appears (1,4,5). Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used for more than 20 years in chronic kidney disease to recompense for reduced endogenous erythropoietin production (1,4,5,25). Recent investigations have pointed out that erythropoietin administration improves kidney functions in chronic kidney disease either directly or indirectly (17-24). The therapeutic benefits of erythropoietin beyond the correction of anemia are still questioned. However, it is notable that various pieces of evidence simply reflect the pleiotropic effects of erythropoietinon on the central nervous, cardiovascular system and on the kidney (18,20,25). In brief, clinical evidence shows the kidney protective potential of erythropoietin in patients with chronic renal failure, however, additional clinical investigations are crucial to outline when to start erythropoietin treatment and what is the optimal erythropoietin dosage for slowing disease progression in patients with chronic renal failure. The application of erythropoietin treatment for renoprotection may need to be earlier than that for erythropoiesis, while it is possible that the erythropoietin attenuation of renal fibrosis through macrophage regulation and endothelial cell protection operates through other unidentified mechanisms. While agents restoring the initial function of renal erythropoietin-producing cells could delay kidney fibrosis, further laboratory studies are necessary to clarify the cellular target of erythropoietin in the kidney and for developing a novel erythropoietin derivative or mimetic for kidney protection.","2014","Cell journal"," In a study to evaluate the ameliorative effects of erythropoietin on renal tubular cells , we studied 40 male rats ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This study assessed treatment routine, effectiveness, and safety of iron isomaltoside (IIM) 5% (Diafer®) in a HD cohort. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 198 HD patients converted from iron sucrose (IS) and treated with IIM according to product label and clinical routine. Data for IIM were compared to historic data for IS in 3-month intervals. The primary endpoint was to show non-inferiority for IIM versus IS in haemoglobin (Hb) maintenance. RESULTS: Most patients (> 60%) followed a fixed low-dose iron treatment protocol. Three minutes were required for preparation and administration of IIM. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) was used in > 80% of patients during both IIM and IS phases. The maintenance of Hb was similar with both iron drugs; the mean Hb level was 11 g/dL, and the mean change of 0.3 g/dL (95% confidence interval: 0.1, 0.5) for IIM 0-3 months compared to IS demonstrated non-inferiority. Nine adverse drug reactions were reported in 2% of patients administered IIM. All patients had uneventful recoveries. The frequency of metallic taste was higher with IS compared to IIM (34% versus 0.5%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: IIM is effective and well tolerated by CKD patients on HD. IIM was non-inferior to IS in maintenance of Hb, and had similar ESA requirements. The fast-push injection of IIM may enable logistical benefits in clinical practice, and the low frequency of metallic taste contributes to patient convenience.

The availability of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA), such as recombinant human erythropoietin, has greatly improved the management of anemia in CKD patients. By increasing hemoglobin levels, ESA therapy has demonstrated to significantly improve quality of life and decrease morbidity and mortality among these patients. Earlier studies suggested that partial correction of anemia in CKD patients with LVH induced a partial regression of LV mass, while mainly uncontrolled and small-sized studies have suggested that anemia treatment with ESA in CKD patients with congestive heart failure improved NYHA class, cardiac function and reduced hospitalization rates. On the other hand, recent randomized controlled trials have reported no benefit of full anemia correction on LVH and no benefit, or even worse outcomes, in CKD patients versus partial anemia correction.

SETTING: 24 NHs in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Older (>or=65 years of age) NH residents with CKD (not receiving dialysis) who were not comatose and were alive as of the day of data abstraction were included in this analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Resident demographics, hemoglobin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate records, and ADL items were abstracted from the medical charts, laboratory records, and MDS. The prevalence of CKD and anemia associated with CKD was evaluated from laboratory records. The relationship between CKD, anemia, and ADLs was assessed through a repeated resampling (bootstrap) analysis. RESULTS: CKD was present in 45.7% of the residents. Of these, 60.5% had anemia.

METHODS: Observational cohort of CKD patients initiating ESA therapy from the Centricity(®) database, 1990-2011. Proportional hazards models tested the hypothesis that a slower Hb RoR (0 < g/dl/month ⩽ 0.125) is associated with a lower cardiovascular (CV) incidence [composite of fatal/nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke] compared with faster RoR (0.125 < g/dl/month ⩽ 2.0, and >2.0 g/dl/month). RESULTS: A total of 9220 patients receiving ESAs were followed for an average of 3.1 years. Slow (group B) RoR versus medium (group C') and fast (group D') RoR in Hb, throughout all Hb milestones, was associated with lower risk of the composite endpoint [B (slow) versus D' (fast) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.20 (0.11, 0.39), p < 0.0001]; B versus C' (medium) [HR = 0.34 (0.19, 0.62), p = 0.0004], and C' versus D' [HR = 0.60 (0.42, 0.85), p = 0.005]]. Within achieved Hb milestones, HRs were: B versus D' at milestone ⩾ 14.1 g/dl [HR = 0.17 (0.05, 0.56); p = 0.004] and at milestone 12.6-14.0 [HR = 0.18 (0.07, 0.46), p = 0.0004].

","Nand N. and Mittal R.","BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D deficiency and inflammation levels in renal anemia has been documented. However, no study is available in India where the role of vitamin D supplementation in patients with hyporesponsiveness to increased doses of erythropoietin is available. Hence this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 50 adult patients of CKD, on regular, twice weekly hemodialysis. It included 38 cases in group A with deficient serum vitamin D levels (<30 ng/ml) and 12 cases in group B with sufficient vitamin D levels (>30 ng/ml). Both groups of cases were receiving erythropoietin in a dose of 4000 I.U. subcutaneously twice weekly following dialysis and had failed to show rise in hemoglobin (Hb) >1gm/dl after one month, hence erythropoietin was increased to 6000 I.U. Group A was given additional vitamin D in a dose of 60000 I.U. orally, once a week for next three months along with erythropoietin 6000 I.U. where as Group B served as control. Hematological and renal parameters, ESR, high sensitivity C reactive protein (HsCRP) and serum ferritin were estimated at baseline and then at one monthly intervals for next four months. Parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum B12, folic acid and vitamin D (25OHD3) were measured at the start and end of the study only. Erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) was calculated to evaluate dose response. RESULTS: Basal ERI, HsCRP and ESR and serum ferritin were raised in both the groups. At the end of four months, there was a significant increase in the Hb and hematocrit (Hct) (p<.001) and a significant fall in ERI, ESR, HsCRP, serum ferritin and iPTH (p<.001) in group A. Group B, also had a significant increase in the hemoglobin and hematocrit (p<.001) and decrease in ERI, ESR, HsCRP, serum ferritin and iPTH which was not significant. Basal vitamin D and ERI had a positive and insignificant correlation (r=0.05; p=0.756) in group A where as a negative and insignificant correlation was observed between them at the end of four months (r= -0.195; p >0.05).

The purpose of this work was to study the effects of intravenous (i.v.) iron administration (ferric gluconate - Ferrlecit) on hemoglobin (Hb) of patients with CKD. METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients with CKD with Hb <12 g/dL in whom no underlying cause for the anemia could be found underwent sternal bone marrow biopsy and had their red cell and blood iron parameters measured. They then received 250 mg of ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) intravenously twice monthly for 3 months, and had their blood parameters measured 1 month later. No patient received erythropoietin (EPO). RESULTS: Forty-six patients had no evidence of any iron deposits in the bone marrow - consistent with the presence of severe iron deficiency. The mean serum ferritin and %transferrin saturation prior to treatment were 235.9 +/- 54.3 ug/L and 13.5 +/- 4.1%, respectively, and both increased significantly with the iron treatment. Mean Hb increased from 10.16 +/- 1.32 to 11.96 +/- 1.52 g/dL, an increase of 1.80 +/- 1.72 g/dL (p<0.01). Twenty-six patients (55.3%) reached the target Hb of 12 g/dL.

","Milovanov Y. et al.","AIM: To identify the early markers of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) and glomerulonephritis (GN) in systemic diseases. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine patients with some male preponderance who were aged 21 to 65 years (45.3±11.1 years) and had CKD (CGN and GN) in systemic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus and Wegener's granulomatosis) in the early stages (Stages I-II) of CKD were examined. GN was diagnosed by a lifetime renal biopsy. Systemic diseases were diagnosed according to the criteria for each nosological entity. The stages of CKD were defined according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria; the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the CKD EPI equation (2012). According to the presence or absence of anemia, all the patients included in the study were divided into 2 groups: 1) 43 (54.4%) anemic patients; 2) 36 (45.6%) non-anemic patients (a control group). In addition to general clinical examination adopted for a nephrology department, special studies, such as determination of the serum levels of hepcidin, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), soluble Klotho protein (s-Klotho), as well as iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT) ratio, were performed to solve the set tasks. RESULTS: Forty-three anemic patients who had a hemoglobin level of 110 (100; 119) g/l and 36 control patients who had the similar values were noted to have statistically significantly (p<0.001) higher levels of IFN-γ (11 (10; 14) and 0.2 (0.09; 0.6) ng/ml), hepcidin (26 (25; 27) and 5.1 (3.8; 5.9) ng/ml) and C-reactive protein (1.5 (1.1; 2.1) and 0.3 (0.2; 0.6) mg/dl), and lower levels of s-Klotho protein (12 (10; 18) pg/ml) and TSAT (18 (14; 19)%. Forty-three patients with anemia were also found to have a statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower GFR (65 (62; 87) and 80.5 (62; 90) ml/min) and higher systolic blood pressure (145 (125; 160) and 120 (115; 16) mm Hg) as compared with those in 36 control patients. At the same time, the compared groups displayed no statistically significant differences in serum ferritin levels (123 (110; 150) and 115 (100; 140) µg/l). Among 43 CKD patients with anemia, its detection rate in the presence of systemic diseases was 3.2 times higher than that in CGN patients (41.7 and 12.7%). ROC analysis revealed that in the CKD patients with CGN and GN, the serum hepcidin level ≥ 25 ng/ml, with the sensitivity and specificity being of 89.7% and 74%, respectively (p > 0.001), was associated with the development of anemia. Moreover, the hemoglobin level of<120 g/ l was found to have an independent impact on the risk of reducing serum s-Klotho production. CONCLUSION: In Stage I-II CKD patients with CGN and GN in the presence of systemic diseases, elevated serum hepcidin levels should be regarded as a predictor for anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Herewith, the decrease in hemoglobin levels <120 g/l is associated with the reduced production of the nephroprotective factor s-Klotho. The treatment of ACD for Stages I-II CKD should encompass intravenous administration of iron in order to increase its content and availability for erythropoiesis.","2017","Terapevticheskii arkhiv"," AIM : To identify the early markers of anemia in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis ( CGN ) and glomerulonephritis ( GN ) in systemic diseases ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Nalado A. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) worsens the prognosis and outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, while the haemoglobin level is unreliable for early detection of IDA, reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr) and hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) are early markers of IDA. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study of black adult participants (n = 258) with CKD and apparently healthy members of staff and patients' relatives (n = 141) at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa, between 1 June 2016 and 31 December 2016. Serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin were measured using standard laboratory methods, while the haematology analyser was employed to measure CHr and %HYPO. The validity of CHr and %HYPO as markers of IDA were evaluated. Multivariable binary logistic regression was conducted to determine predictors of the relationship between IDA, CHr and %HYPO. The area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of the final models were utilised to evaluate the discriminatory value of CHr and %HYPO respectively. RESULTS: About one-quarter (26.1%) of the participants had IDA which was more than three times more frequent among CKD patients, compared to controls (35.3% vs 9.2%); 32.3% (95%CI: 27.90%- 37.10%) of the study population had iron deficiency without anaemia and the prevalence of iron deficiency without anaemia was lower in CKD patients compared to controls (29.5% vs 37.6%). The mean age of CKD patients was higher than in controls (52.7 ±14.3 vs 40.4 ±12.6 years, P-value<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IDA among CKD participants was 62.6% and 80.2% respectively for CHr (at a cut-off value of <28pg) and 63.3% and 79.8% respectively for %HYPO. CKD participants with CHr levels >28pg were 82% less likely to be diagnosed as having IDA as compared to those with CHr levels ≤ 28pg) (adj odds ratio = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.09-0.37). The AUC of CHr (0.81, 95% CI: 0.76-0.87) was higher than the AUC of %HYPO (0.76, 95%CI: 0.70-0.82). CONCLUSION: The diagnostic usefulness of CHr and the screening performance of %HYPO in predicting IDA among CKD patients are high. Their lower cost compared to conventional markers of ID recommend their use in clinical practice. Further cost effectiveness studies of these parameters are warranted.","2018","PloS one",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: We undertook a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of intravenous iron sucrose treatment (200mg/mL weekly for five weeks) in patients with chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and iron-deficiency anaemia receiving optimal treatment for chronic heart failure (N=60). Markers of disease severity, iron status, anaemia and inflammation were measured during a six-month follow-up period, and evaluation of echocardiographic parameters was performed at baseline and six months after treatment. RESULTS: At six months after treatment initiation, intravenous iron was associated with reduced severity of the symptoms of chronic heart failure and improved renal function (both p<0.001 versus control). Also, ferritin and transferrin saturation levels were increased, as were haemoglobin levels, whereas inflammatory markers were reduced (all p<0.001 versus control). Left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters were increased and improved left ventricular function correlated with iron status in patients receiving intravenous iron but not patients in the control group.

Vadadustat (AKB-6548) is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase domain (HIF-PHD) inhibitor that is being investigated for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD. METHODS: A phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial (NCT01381094) was undertaken in adults with anemia secondary to CKD stage 3 or 4. Eligible subjects were evenly randomized to 5 groups: 240, 370, 500, or 630 mg of once-daily oral vadadustat or placebo for 6 weeks. All subjects received low-dose supplemental oral iron (50 mg daily). The primary endpoint was the mean absolute change in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline to the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints included iron indices, safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: Ninety-three subjects were randomized. Compared with placebo, vadadustat significantly increased Hb after 6 weeks in a dose-dependent manner (analysis of variance; p < 0.0001). Vadadustat increased the total iron-binding capacity and decreased concentrations of ferritin and hepcidin. The proportion of subjects with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event was similar between vadadustat- and placebo-treated groups. No significant changes in blood pressure, vascular endothelial growth factor, C-reactive protein, or total cholesterol were observed. Limitations of this study included its small sample size and short treatment duration.

The current study was conducted to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of a less frequent dosing regimen (once weekly) in this population. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study enrolled 1,557 adult anemic (hemoglobin (Hb) < or = 10 g/dl) CKD patients not on dialysis. Epoetin alfa 10,000 U was administered subcutaneously once weekly for 16 weeks. Titration to 20,000 U once weekly at week 5 was permitted if patients had an increase in Hb < 1 g/dl. Safety and efficacy were assessed by changes in health-related quality of life (Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) and Kidney Disease Questionnaire (KDQ)), changes in hematologic parameters and transfusion utilization, and incidence and severity of adverse events. RESULTS: 1,338 patients were evaluable for efficacy. Mean Hb level increased from 9.1 g/dl at baseline to 11.6 g/dl at study completion (last observed value after baseline) (p < 0.0001). Overall, 89.8% of patients responded to once-weekly dosing, exhibiting an increase in Hb level of > or = 1 g/dl from baseline. The percentage of patients that required transfusion decreased from 11.1% (baseline) to 3.7% (during the study) (p < 0.0001). All quality-of-life parameters improved significantly from baseline (p < 0.0001). Mean LASA scores for energy, activity and overall quality of life increased from baseline to study completion by 27.9 mm (70.5%), 24.5 mm (57.0%) and 22.6 mm (47.4%), respectively.

Our aim was to determine whether targeting different haemoglobin concentrations with such treatment is associated with altered all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with anaemia caused by chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials that were identified in medical databases and trial registration websites. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the effects of targeting different haemoglobin concentrations in patients with anaemia caused by chronic disease who were randomly assigned to treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin, recruited at least 100 patients, and had a minimum follow-up of 12 weeks. FINDINGS: We analysed nine randomised controlled trials that enrolled 5143 patients. There was a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.35; p=0.031) and arteriovenous access thrombosis (1.34, 1.16-1.54; p=0.0001) in the higher haemoglobin target group than in the lower haemoglobin target group in the fixed effects model without heterogeneity between studies. There was a significantly higher risk of poorly controlled blood pressure (1.27, 1.08-1.50; p=0.004) in the higher haemoglobin target group than in the lower target haemoglobin group with the fixed effects model; however, this was not significant in the random effects model (1.31, 0.97-1.78; p=0.075). The incidence of myocardial infarction was much the same in the two groups. INTERPRETATION: To target higher haemoglobin concentrations when treating patients with anaemia caused by chronic kidney disease with recombinant human erythropoietin puts such patients at increased risk of death.

However, all of these analyses did not take into consideration that chronic kidney disease (CKD) plays an important role in erythropoiesis and anaemia. Therefore, we assessed in this study whether anaemia is an independent predictor of mortality or if its impact was confounded by CKD, which is known to have itself a marked impact on outcomes of patients with CHD. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we analysed 709 patients with symptomatic and significant CHD who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions. Patients were classified as anaemic using the WHO definition; renal function was classified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: In comparison with non-anaemic patients, anaemic patients had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality (4.9 vs 0.5%, P<0.001). Moreover, 1-year mortality rates of anaemic patients were significantly higher regardless of whether they had a normal eGFR (22 vs 2.8%, P=0.029), an eGFR of 60-89 ml/min (14 vs 4.2%, P<0.001), an eGFR of 30-59 ml/min (21 vs 3.7%, P<0.001) or an eGFR<30 ml/min (26 vs 0%, NS). When cumulative mortality was analysed by haemoglobin concentrations in steps of 1 g/dl from <11.0 g/dl to >16.9 g/dl, 1-year mortality rates were 28, 18, 15, 5.5, 3.8, 5.7, 1.5 and 0%, respectively (P<0.001, log rank). Even after adjustment for comorbidities by multivariable Cox regression models, haemoglobin remained a significant predictor of long-term mortality (hazard rate ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62-0.82, P<0.001) while eGFR was not (hazard rate ratio 1.0, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01).

PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred eleven NH residents with chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) ) who had anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL for women, <13 g/dL for men, n = 177) or not (n = 134). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the distance walked or wheeled for 10 minutes. Secondary outcomes were single chair stand time, grip strength, leg extension strength, Dartmouth Primary Care Cooperative Information scores, Modified Barthel Index, falls, hospitalization, and mortality. RESULTS: Mixed-effects model analysis of distance walked or wheeled showed that changes between weeks 2 and 14 but not between weeks 2 and 26 were significantly different between participants with CKD with anemia and those without anemia. There were no significant differences for the other physical performance or self-report measures. After adjustment for an anemia propensity score, participants with CKD with anemia did not have higher rates of hospitalization or death at 26 weeks than those without anemia. CONCLUSION: Nursing home residents with CKD and anemia experienced greater decline than those with CKD without anemia only for a mobility distance task over a 3-month but not a 6-month period and not for other performance or self-report measures.

The purpose of this study was to determine if oral Heme Iron Polypeptide (HIP) is as effective as IV iron sucrose in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia for patients with ND-CKD. METHODS: Forty ND-CKD patients were randomized; 18 to HIP 11 mg orally 3 times per day and 22 to IV iron sucrose 200 mg monthly for 6 months. Baseline clinical and laboratory data were collected for all patients. The primary and secondary outcomes for the study were hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration and iron indices [ferritin and percentage transferrin saturation (TSAT)] at the end of 6 months respectively. Adverse events were also compared. RESULTS: The baseline demographic characteristics and laboratory values were similar for the two groups. After 6 months of treatment, Hb in the HIP group was 117 g/L and 113 g/L in the IV sucrose group (p = 0.37). The TSAT at 6 months was not different between the two groups {p = 0.82}but the serum ferritin was significantly higher in the IV iron sucrose group {85.5 ug/L in HIP and 244 ug/L; p = 0.004}.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this phase II, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial, patients were randomized 1:1 to either 1.02 g ferumoxytol (2 × 510-mg injections) or 1.0 g iron sucrose administered as either a slow injection or infusion (10 doses for dialysis patients and 5 doses for nondialysis patients). Inclusion criteria included hemoglobin<11.0 g/dl, transferrin saturation<30%, and eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a diagnosis of underlying CKD (e.g., nephropathy or nephritis). The primary end point was change in hemoglobin from baseline to week 5. RESULTS: In total, 162 patients were randomized. Demographics were balanced between the treatment groups. Adverse event profiles of the two regimens were fairly similar: overall adverse events, 48% ferumoxytol versus 65% iron sucrose; related adverse events, 10% ferumoxytol versus 16% iron sucrose; and adverse events leading to study discontinuation, 1% ferumoxytol versus 5% iron sucrose.

,"23441533"," [Clinical relevance of anemia treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease]. ","Vuksanović-Mikulicić S. et al.","INTRODUCTION: In the last ten years or so, there has been a steady increase in the number of patients with chronic kidney disease and those with end-stage renal failure who require some form of renal replacement therapy. Anemia is a well-known consequence of chronic kidney disease; its prevalence increases with the progression of renal failure and occurs in up to 95% of patients in the final stages of chronic kidney disease. In recent years, the greatest advance in the treatment of renal anemia has been made by the introduction of erythropoietin preparations, the application of which has significantly improved the patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the treatment of renal anemia in chronic kidney disease patients not treated by dialysis affects the outcome of their treatment, reduces the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, delays the need of dialysis, reduces morbidity and mortality, and reduces the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chronic kidney disease presenting for regular outpatient follow up at Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, Rijeka University Hospital Center. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 included patients whose renal anemia was treated with erythropoietin and group 2 patients whose anemia of chronic kidney disease was treated in any other way, regardless of the reason for the exclusion of erythropoietin. Each group included 31 patients with chronic kidney disease. During two years, each patient's laboratory parameters of chronic renal disease and renal anemia treatment were monitored at intervals not longer than six months. In addition, each patient's number of hospitalizations was recorded, taking into account the cause of hospitalization and the number of days spent in hospital. RESULTS: During the two-year period, 62 patients with chronic kidney disease were analyzed (31 patients in the groups receiving and not receiving erythropoietin each). The mean age was 66 +/- 13.5 in the group receiving erythropoietin and 68 +/- 13.6 in the group not receiving erythropoietin. There were 70% of men and 30% of women in the former group, and 53% of men and 47% of women in the latter group. Examination for comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia and previous stroke) revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients. There were no statistically significant differences in changes of biochemical parameters (Fe, ferritin, CRP, albumin, calcium, phosphorus) between the two groups of patients during the two-year period either. There was no statistically significant between group-difference in the glomerular filtration rate after two years, but a tendency of slower progression of renal failure was observed in patients having received erythropoietin as compared to those who did not receive erythropoietin. Moreover, the number of hospitalizations due to adverse cardiovascular events was statistically significantly lower in patients that received erythropoietin, while there was no statistically significant difference in the total number of hospitalizations, hospitalizations for other indications (infection, bleeding, and worsening of renal failure), or total number of days spent in hospital, regardless of indication. CONCLUSION: The number of patients with chronic kidney disease and those with end-stage renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy is increasing. Renal anemia, which occurs as a consequence of chronic kidney disease, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and with a reduced quality of life in these patients. Consequently, it is necessary to recognize this condition and apply appropriate treatment early in order to prolong life and improve the quality of life of patients with chronic kidney disease.","2012","Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti"," The aim of this study was to analyze whether the treatment of renal anemia in chronic kidney disease patients not treated by dialysis affects the outcome of their treatment , reduces the incidence of cardiovascular diseases , delays the need of dialysis , reduces morbidity and mortality , and reduces the incidence","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The pharmacometric approach was applied to assess the relationship between plasma concentrations of enarodustat and hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and to provide information regarding the optimal use of enarodustat in clinical practice by simulations based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that was developed. The PK/PD data of enarodusat obtained from phase 2 and phase 3 studies in Japanese patients with CKD were well described by the models: a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination for PK, and a semimechanistic model based on transit compartment model for PD. Although several factors were identified as statistically significant covariates on the PK/PD of enarodustat, model-based simulations showed that none of them had clinically relevant impacts on the treatment effect (ie, Hb levels) of enarodustat. Hence, enarodustat treatment provides the stable Hb control with the initial dose (hemodialysis-dependent CKD: 4 mg/day, non-dialysis-dependent CKD: 2 mg/day) and maintenance dose (1-8 mg/day) to the patients with varied demographic characteristics.","2023","Journal of clinical pharmacology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Korbet S.","A number of conditions can contribute to the development of the anemia that inevitably occurs with end-stage renal disease. The primary ones are decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO), decreased response to EPO by the bone marrow, and shortened red cell survival. Dialysis improves hematocrit levels by reducing plasma volume and by increasing red cell mass as a result of clearing some of the middle molecule uremic toxins that affect EPO efficiency and red cell survival time. Patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis generally show higher hematocrits and lower transfusion dependencies than hemodialysis patients. The development of recombinant human EPO (EPOGEN, AMGEN Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) largely ends the transfusion dependence of hemodialysis patients and may prove efficacious in those patients who are not transfusion dependent but whose low hematocrit levels may cause debilitating symptoms.","1989","Seminars in nephrology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Results. 153 patients received a total of 251 doses of TDI (mean ± SD = 971 ± 175 mg); age 69 ± 12 years and Creatinine 3.3 ± 1.9 mg/dL. All CKD stages were represented (stage 4 commonest). Hgb and Fe stores improved post-TDI (P ≪ 0.001). There was a very mild decrease in PLT (pre-TDI 255 versus post-TDI 244, P = 0.30). The mild reduction in PLT after TDI remained non-significant (P > 0.05) when data was stratified by molecular weight (MW) of iron dextran used (low versus high), as well as by dose administered (<1000 versus ≥1000 mg). Linear regression analysis between pre-dose PLT and Tsat and Fe showed R2 of 0.01 and 0.04, respectively. Conclusion.

","Laras H. et al.","In chronic kidney disease, anemia and malnutrition coupled with inflammation as malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrom are common and considered as morbidity-mortality factors. The link between these two factors has been described at length in the literature highlighting an association of malnutrition with iron deficiency considered itself as one of the causes of anemia in chronic kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis). Our study aims to know the prevalence of these two factors in a population of chronic kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis) of Algiers and to highlight the possible associations between them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a multicentre, cross-sectional and descriptive study carried out over a period of 6months (August 2018 to January 2019). Anemia and malnutrition were assessed by various biological and clinical tools such as the malnutrition inflammation score and the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism criteria. Statistical tests were performed on the R studio software, considering P<0.05 as a statistically significant value. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine patients on chronic kidney disease were included (90 non dialysis and 119 hemodialysis). The median age was 70 (IQR=16) for non dialysis and 56 (IQR=16.5) for hemodialysis. The prevalence of anemia was 66.66% (n=60) in non dialysis and 70.58% (n=84) in hemodialysis. Absolute iron deficiency anemia was higher in non dialysis (48.33%; n=29) while functional iron deficiency anemia was higher in hemodialysis (34.52%; n=29). The prevalence of malnutrition by malnutrition inflammation score was relatively low. Only functional iron deficiency anemia was associated with malnutrition.

Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to compare periods of anemia and nonanemia for average monthly medical costs; the latter was adjusted for age, gender, GFR, diabetes, hypertension, liver cirrhosis, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular hypertrophy. A subset analysis of patients with moderate CKD (stage 3) was conducted. A total of 2001 patients were identified. Untreated anemia was associated with a significant increase in medical costs, with an unadjusted incremental monthly cost of $1089 (P < 0.0001) and a cost ratio of 1.8:1 relative to nonanemia. After controlling for covariates, untreated anemia remained significantly associated with a cost increase (adjusted incremental monthly cost $503; cost ratio 1.4:1; P < 0.0001). Similar significant cost burden was observed in the subset of patients with moderate CKD. The retrospective observational design may be more susceptible to bias than a randomized, controlled trial.

However, the significance of these assays has been less evaluated in patients with diabetes and pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: GA, HbA(1c) and fasting serum glucose were measured simultaneously in 146 patients with diabetes. Based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the subjects were categorized into a pre-dialysis CKD group (eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) , n = 97) and a non-CKD group (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) , n = 49). RESULTS: The glucose/HbA(1c) and GA/HbA(1c) ratios were significantly higher in the CKD group than those in the non-CKD group. The glucose/GA ratio did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the pre-dialysis CKD group, eGFR was negatively correlated with the glucose/HbA(1c) ratio (r = -0.343, P = 0.001) and the GA/HbA(1c) ratio (r = -0.499, P < 0.001). However, no significant correlation was detected between eGFR and the glucose/GA ratio. In the non-CKD group, eGFR was not correlated with the glucose/HbA(1c) ratio, the glucose/GA ratio, or the GA/HbA(1c) ratio. A multivariate regression analysis showed that eGFR had a significant impact on HbA(1c) but no effect on GA in the pre-dialysis CKD group (β = 0.210, P = 0.005). In the non-CKD group, eGFR did not affect HbA(1c) or GA.

The study was performed between April and June 2006. A total of 137 physicians (89.5%) answered the questionnaire from 129 (87.1%) dialysis centers that catered to 7052 (89.2%) dialysis patients. There were 104 respondents (75.9%) who staged their CKD patients according to the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

","Nurko S. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The approved dosing interval for currently available erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is 2 to 3 times weekly for epoetin alfa (EPO) and every 1 to 2 weeks for darbepoetin alfa (DARB). However, clinicians sometimes use less frequent dosing in the interest of convenience. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated patterns of actual ESA use (doses and dosing intervals) and hemoglo- bin (Hb) control in adult outpatients with CKD not requiring dialysis at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation anemia clinic. The distribution of and variability in Hb levels in these patients were also examined. METHODS: The clinical charts and electronic records of adult outpatients with CKD who initiated ESA therapy before March 2005 were reviewed to identify the initial, dominant (used for the longest consecutive period), and final dosing intervals and mean weekly doses of EPO and DARB. Hb control was examined in terms of maximum deviations >12 g/dL and <11 g/dL, and the proportions of measurements outside these values. RESULTS: The analysis included data from 111 outpatients (mean [SD] age, 65.9 [14.4] years; 53.2% male; 66.7% white, 29.7% black, 2.7% other, 0.9% unknown ethnicity). Twenty-one patients received EPO only, 74 received DARB only, and 16 switched ESAs. The mean duration of follow-up was 20.5 months. The most common initial dosing intervals were qwk for EPO (66.7%) and q2wk for DARB (90.5%). The dominant dosing intervals were q2wk in 61.9% of EPO patients and q3wk in 62.3% of DARB patients. However, 80.0% of those who received EPO q2wk and 63.2% of those who received DARB q3wk eventually returned to their initial dosing intervals. The largest proportions of Hb mea- surements <11 g/dL occurred at dominant dosing intervals of qwk for EPO and q2wk for DARB (both, 46.0%; 11 and 26 patients, respectively), whereas the largest proportions of measurements >12 g/dL occurred with EPO dosed at q2wk (44.0%; 5 patients) and DARB dosed at >q4wk (62.0%; 5 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of ESA usage in adult outpatients with CKD at this center indicated that clinicians extended dosing intervals beyond those in the approved prescribing information. However, variations in Hb concentrations occurred during maintenance therapy administered at extended dosing intervals, resulting in the resumption of shorter dosing intervals in the majority of patients.","2007","Clinical therapeutics"," OBJECTIVES : This study investigated patterns of actual ESA use ( doses and dosing intervals ) and hemoglo- bin ( Hb ) control in adult outpatients with CKD not requiring dialysis at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation anemia clinic ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: The study analyzed claims data on incident hemodialysis patients aged > or = 18 years (identified between January 2000 and November 2005). Patients were identified as anemic and ESA-treated prior to dialysis. ESA treatment was categorized into 4 consistency groups (from least to most consistent ESA use). RESULTS: Of 5,848 hemodialysis patients, 52% were identified as anemic prior to onset of dialysis. Predialysis ESA treatment was received by 62% of anemic patients, with only 23% receiving the most consistent treatment. The risk of a CV event was significantly lower for the ESA-treated compared with ESA-untreated patients (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.61 - 0.82)). Compared with ESA-untreated, those who received ESAs had significantly lower risk of acute myocardial infarction (RR 0.65 (95% CI 0.44 - 0.95)) or inpatient mortality (RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.40 - 0.68)). ESA-treated patients in each of the 4 consistency groups had significantly lower risk of CV events compared with ESA-untreated patients, with the greatest benefit seen in patients who received most consistent ESA (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.48 - 0.76)).

Serum creatinine levels were calibrated indirectly across studies, and GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. CKD was defined as GFR between 15 and 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). LVH was based on electrocardiogram criteria. Anemia was defined as hematocrit <36% in women and 39% in men. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death; a secondary cardiac outcome included only myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease. Among 2423 patients with CKD, 96% had electrocardiogram and anemia data. Median follow-up was 102 mo.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the KoreaN Cohort Study for Outcome in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (KNOW-CKD). Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the independent association of albuminuria with anemia. Furthermore, odds ratios for anemia were calculated by cross-categorization of ACR and eGFR. RESULTS: Among 1,456 patients, the mean age was 53.5 ± 12.4 years, and the mean eGFR and ACR were 51.9 ± 30.5 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and 853.2 ± 1,330.3 mg/g, respectively. Anemia was present in 644 patients (40.5%).

","Baglin A. et al.","PURPOSE: Erythropoietin is the treatment of the anaemia in chronic kidney disease. A target rate of haemoglobin higher than 11 g/dl was usually proposed, but recent recommendations stated that higher limit of haemoglobin was to be reached, with the aim to improve the quality of life of the patients and to reduce their risks of cardiovascular diseases. These objectives are to be revised, according to the results of recently published clinical trials. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Patients treated to reach a high rate of haemoglobin (between 13 and 14,5 g/dl) have an improved quality of life, but a 30% higher mortality rate, compared to patients treated with a lower objective of haemoglobin rate (10-12 g/dl). Hypertension and vascular access thromboses were also more frequent in the patients with the highest haemoglobin rate. Two to three times more erythropoietin was necessary to reach the higher rate of haemoglobin. These results favour a target rate of haemoglobin not higher than 12 g/dl. A polemic followed the results of these clinical trials, mostly in the United States, questioning the way in which the higher limit had been fixed whereas precise data were unavailable. The role of pharmaceutical industry and of for profit dialysis centres was underlined. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: The next step is now to explain if the excess in cardiovascular morbimortality is related to the haemoglobin rate or to a direct effect of the erythropoietin. Such an understanding is important, the more so as new erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are being developed.","2008","La Revue de medecine interne"," PURPOSE : Erythropoietin is the treatment of the anaemia in chronic kidney disease ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Iron supplements are commonly prescribed for these patients with or without erythropoietin therapy by means of oral and intravenous iron. Both oral and intravenous irons have their own advantage and disadvantage, and the efficacy is also different. The objective of the study is to analyze the efficacy of oral and intravenous iron in chronic kidney disease patients on erythropoietin therapy, an erythropoiesis stimulating agents for increment of haemoglobin. METHODS: This is a prospective study comparing intravenous iron to oral iron in chronic kidney disease patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis at different centers and visited Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital from April 2010 to April 2011. Patients having a haemoglobin level of < 11 g/dl, transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 25%, ferritin < 300ng/ml and who were on erythropoietin therapy were allocated alternately into two groups to receive oral iron (iron fumarate) or IV iron (iv sucrose). Haemoglobin was measured after 30 days of therapy. RESULTS: A significant increase in haemoglobin levels was observed in both groups. But the mean haemoglobin increment was more in the IV iron group than in the oral iron group. Sixty percent 60% of patients in the IV iron group had an increase in the haemoglobin level of more than 1gm/dl while only 20% of the oral iron group had this increase.

,"17136694"," Evidence for optimal hemoglobin targets in chronic kidney disease. ","Navaneethan S. et al.","Even though anemia occurs frequently in patients with chronic kidney disease and therapeutic options are widely available, the ideal hemoglobin target level is not clearly established. We start from 2 anecdotes and review the evidence in favor of and against higher (>12 g/dL) and normal hemoglobin targets as compared to subnormal or low hemoglobin levels in different subsets of chronic kidney disease (either predialysis or dialysis). Current clinical trials and their systematic reviews have found that higher hemoglobin levels (>12 g/dL) do not significantly impact on patient-level cardiovascular end points including cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients feel better, and enhanced quality of life parameters have been identified in most short-term studies when higher hemoglobin levels are achieved. However, achieving and maintaining higher hemoglobin levels carry the risk of hypertension and vascular access thrombosis in dialysis patients and are costly. In addition, a potential for increased risk of death (or no benefit at most) with higher Hb levels has been found in patients with severe cardiac disease in a larger trial. Benefits of and harm from hemoglobin targets should be carefully weighed, and certainly more, proper studies are needed before higher hemoglobin levels (>12 g/dL) are widely adopted in these high-risk patients.","2006","Journal of nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Cianciaruso B. et al.","BACKGROUND: This study is part of a 3-country study testing whether normal levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) delay the progression of left ventricular (LV) growth in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients not on dialysis. METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, controlled trial conducted in 27 tertiary-care hospitals in Italy. Treated subjects (n=46) received epoetin-alpha (EPO-alpha) to maintain Hgb levels in the range 12-14 g/dL. Control subjects (n=49) were not treated unless their Hgb decreased to 9.0 g/dL. Primary outcome was LV mass index (MI) change after 24 months. Subcutaneous EPO-alpha was withdrawn in Europe and the study prematurely terminated; therefore, a 12-month analysis was carried out. RESULTS: Mean age was 57 years (38% were women, 18% with diabetes, 76% taking ACEI or ARB and 22% statins). EPO-alpha median final dose was 2,000 IU/week. Hgb significantly increased (12.4 -/+ 1.1 g/L) for the treatment group and decreased for controls (11.3 -/+ 1.3 g/L; p<0.001). The intention-to-treat analysis was conducted in 78 patients. Mean baseline LVMI for treated patients and controls was 109.5 -/+ 23 g/m2 and 108.7 -/+ 29 g/m2, respectively. LVMI did not change among controls, whereas it decreased slightly, though not significantly, among treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The current Italian trial was negative, maybe due to its limitations: lack of power, 1-year follow-up and normal LVMI in some patients at start; however, it was consistent with other published studies. Thus, it is unlikely that targeting hemoglobin in the normal range for CKD patients is of benefit.","2008","Journal of nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The commonly observed association among lower hemoglobin levels, left ventricular hypertrophy, and higher mortality also has been seen within randomized trials when assigned hemoglobin targets were ignored; critically, however, corresponding relationships were absent when intention-to-treat principles were used, strongly suggesting noncausal associations and the need for randomized designs. This being said, hemoglobin typical target trials often have undesirable features, including inadequate blinding and the use of imbalanced, nonstandardized, nonblinded co-interventions. The trials published to date, spanning hemoglobin levels of approximately 7 to 13 g/dl, suggest that higher treatment targets enhance quality of life but at the price of higher BP, thrombotic events, and reduced dialysis adequacy in hemodialysis patients. To date, there is no convincing evidence that targets that approach the physiologic range (versus intermediate targets) have an effect on left ventricular size or survival. Therefore, depending on the outcome examined, higher hemoglobin levels may have beneficial effects, harmful effects, or no effect, leading to the unsatisfactory situation of having to make opinion-based tradeoff decisions. Whereas the available evidence suggests that 11 g/dl is a reasonable lower bound for the hemoglobin target range, the upper bound remains to be defined and targets above 13 g/dl cannot be routinely recommended.","2006","Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN","The major objectives of this article are to review hemoglobin outcome studies , focusing on the utility of purely observational approaches ; the design limitations of hemoglobin target randomized trials ; what is known from the trials that have been performed to date ; and whether confident recommendations for target ranges can be","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Wish J.","The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing at an alarming rate in the United States and other Western countries, due in part to an increased incidence of diabetes, which itself appears to be a direct consequence of the obesity epidemic in modern society. Hypertension, a condition that also results from or is exacerbated by excess body weight, remains an important cause of CKD as well. In patients with CKD, anemia is both a common occurrence and a significant risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality, especially from cardiac complications such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. Correction of anemia in patients with CKD is associated with demonstrated benefits, including a reduction in hospitalization and per-patient healthcare expenditures. In this article, Dr Wish describes the magnitude of the population with, or at risk for, CKD in the United States and examines data on the risks associated with anemia, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.

","Leikis M. et al.","Physical function is limited in patients with kidney disease, although previous studies have been confounded by anemia. What is not clear is how physical performance changes over time as renal function deteriorates. A cohort of 12 patients (10 male, two female; mean +/- SD age 49 +/- 11 yr) who had stages 3 to 4 chronic kidney disease without previous anemia were examined, and nine were followed for a 2-yr period. Assessments were made of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) by cycle ergometry, leg extension strength, and fatigue on an isokinetic dynamometer and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (TMCSA) by computed tomography. At baseline, creatinine clearance was 31 +/- 13 ml/min and hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) was 129 +/- 9 g/L. VO2peak was low (1.88 L/min, 82% of predicted), and maximal isometric voluntary contraction was 188 +/- 42 Nm, with a TMCSA of 144 +/- 27 cm2. VO2peak correlated with creatinine clearance corrected for body surface area (r = 0.613, P = 0.034) but not to [Hb]. VO2peak adjusted for patient weight correlated with leg fatigue (r = -0.693, P = 0.012). For those with follow-up tests, there were falls in renal function by 28% (P = 0.007) and VO2peak by 9% (P = 0.03), whereas [Hb] did not change. Leg strength fell across a range of isokinetic speeds (P = 0.04), whereas no change in TMCSA was observed. In conclusion, exercise performance as measured by aerobic (VO2peak) and leg strength tests were reduced in patients with stages 3 to 4 chronic kidney disease.

","Brockenbrough A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Hypogonadism and anemia are common comorbid conditions in dialysis patients. Testosterone replacement may improve such clinical parameters as anemia, sarcopenia, and low libido. Additionally, by increasing hemoglobin levels, testosterone replacement may allow for a dose reduction in recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), thereby reducing cost. METHODS: This phase IV, single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effect of transdermal testosterone on serum testosterone levels, rHuEPO dose required to maintain hemoglobin level, bone mineral content, lean body mass and fat content, cholesterol level, sexual function, and mood. Forty hypogonadal male hemodialysis patients who were administered rHuEPO were randomly assigned to 100 mg of topical 1% testosterone gel (Testim; Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Norristown, PA) or placebo, applied daily for 6 months. RESULTS: Forty men with a mean age of 56 years and baseline serum testosterone level less than 300 ng/dL (< 10.4 nmol/L) participated in this trial. In men assigned to administration of transdermal testosterone, there was an increase beyond that in the placebo group in mean serum testosterone (77.1 ng/dL [2.7 nmol/L]), dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 0.8 nmol/L), and estradiol levels (6.3 pg/mL [23.0 pmol/L]) and a decrease in mean serum luteinizing hormone levels (-3.1 IU/L). Compared with subjects administered placebo, participants on testosterone replacement therapy did not show an appreciable change in rHuEPO dose (mean difference adjusted for baseline values, 12.6 U/kg/wk; P = 0.73), bone mineral density, lean body mass or fat content, cholesterol level, sexual function, or mood. CONCLUSION: Daily administration of 100 mg of topical 1% testosterone gel for 6 months failed to significantly increase serum testosterone or DHT levels in hypogonadal men with end-stage renal disease. Treatment with transdermal testosterone did not impact on rHuEPO requirement or clinical parameters in this small placebo-controlled study.

Dialysis patients have an abnormally low HRV and are at increased risk for sudden death. A reduction in HRV is associated with anemia. HRV was therefore measured in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) after hemoglobin normalization. METHODS: Sixteen nondiabetic patients with CKD stage 4 (glomerular filtration rate 23.7 +/- 13.9 ml/min) and renal anemia received epoetin aiming at a hemoglobin level of 135-150 g/L. HRV was measured by 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram at baseline and after hemoglobin normalization and in a reference group consisting of 16 volunteers without impairment of renal function. RESULTS: Hemoglobin level increased from 100.7 +/- 12.6 g/L to 142.4 +/- 7.2 g/L during the study. At baseline, HRV measured in the time domain as the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in the entire 24-hour electrocardiogram (SDNN) was 116.3 +/- 39.2 ms compared with 147.5 +/- 27.2 ms in the reference group (p<0.05).

","Go A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have associated reduced hemoglobin levels with increased adverse events in heart failure. It is unclear, however, whether this relation is explained by underlying kidney disease, treatment differences, or associated comorbidity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the associations between hemoglobin level, kidney function, and risks of death and hospitalization in persons with chronic heart failure between 1996 and 2002 within a large, integrated, healthcare delivery system in northern California. Longitudinal outpatient hemoglobin and creatinine levels and clinical and treatment characteristics were obtained from health plan records. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR; mL.min(-1).1.73 m(-2)) was estimated from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Mortality data were obtained from state death files; heart failure admissions were identified by primary discharge diagnoses. Among 59,772 adults with heart failure, the mean age was 72 years and 46% were women. Compared with that for hemoglobin levels of 13.0 to 13.9 g/dL, the multivariable-adjusted risk of death increased with lower hemoglobin levels: an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.16 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.11 to 1.21 for hemoglobin levels of 12.0 to 12.9 g/dL; HR, 1.50 and 95% CI, 1.44 to 1.57 for 11.0 to 11.9 g/dL; HR, 1.89 and 95% CI, 1.80 to 1.98 for 10.0 to 10.9; HR, 2.31 and 95% CI, 2.18 to 2.45 for 9.0 to 9.9; and HR, 3.48 and 95% CI, 3.25 to 3.73 for <9.0 g/dL. Hemoglobin levels > or = 17.0 g/dL were associated with an increased risk of death (adjusted HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.63). Compared with those with a GFR > or = 60 mL . min(-1).1.73 m(-2), persons with a GFR <45 mL.min(-1).1.73 m(-2) had an increased mortality risk: adjusted HR, 1.39 and 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.44 for 30 to 44; HR, 2.28 and 95% CI, 2.19 to 2.39 for 15 to 29; HR, 3.26 and 95% CI, 3.05 to 3.49 for <15; and HR, 2.44 and 95% CI, 2.28 to 2.61 for those on dialysis. Relations were similar for the risk of hospitalization. The findings did not differ among patients with preserved or reduced systolic function, and hemoglobin level was an independent predictor of outcomes at all levels of kidney function. CONCLUSIONS: Very high (> or = 17 g/dL) or reduced (<13 g/dL) hemoglobin levels and chronic kidney disease independently predict substantially increased risks of death and hospitalization in heart failure, regardless of the level of systolic function.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this post hoc analysis was to examine the efficacy and safety profile of once-monthly (QM) darbepoetin alfa in study patients stratified according to age (ie, <65, 65-74, and > or =75 years). METHODS: Patients with CKD but not on dialysis, receiving darbepoetin alfa every other week (Q2W), and with stable hemoglobin (Hb) levels between 11 and 13 g/dL, inclusive, were enrolled in this 33-week, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study.

The proportion of patients who successfully maintained hemoglobin concentrations between 10.0 and 12.0 g/dl and the mean darbepoetin alfa dose were evaluated. Safety measurements (e.g. adverse events, laboratory parameters, blood pressure) and seroreactivity were assessed. RESULTS: Hemoglobin concentration was maintained within the target range in 79% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 71% to 87%) of all patients receiving darbepoetin alfa and in 85% (95% Cl = 78% - 93%) of patients who completed the study period.

Given the lack of studies regarding outcomes according to the day of Hb sampling, the existing guidelines do not strongly recommend regarding measurement timing. Pre-dialysis mid-week sampling (Wednesday and Thursday) is preferable to minimize short-term Hb variability, although numerous HD centers perform early-week sampling (Monday and Tuesday). The different measurement days may influence the prescribed dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and related patient outcomes. We investigated changes in Hb levels and ESA doses according to the Hb measurement day among HD patients. METHODS: Starting September 2013, the day for pre-dialysis Hb measurement at the Asan Medical Center was changed from early-week days to mid-week days. This single-center retrospective study evaluated medical records of 92 patients who received maintenance HD between September 2012 and August 2014. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean Hb levels between early-week days and mid-week days (10.71 ± 0.06 g/dL vs. 10.78 ± 0.47 g/dL, p = 0.105).

","Solomon L. and Hendler E.","Ferrokinetic and RBC mass determinations were made at 3-month intervals in iron-replete hemodialysis patients randomized to a control group or to nandrolone decanoate therapy. After 3 months, RBC mass increased in two of 4 androgen-treated patients. Erythron iron turnover, an index of RBC production, increased in the one responder studied but not in the two nonresponders. Similarly, in a fifth subject, who was not restudied until 6 months of androgen therapy were completed, an increase in RBC mass was associated with an increase in erythron iron turnover. However, between 3 and 6 months, RBC mass increased in all 4 androgen-treated patients studied even though erythron iron turnovers remained unchanged and dialysis-associated blood losses did not decrease. Thus, at least two androgen-treated patients had increases in RBC mass without ever increasing their erythron iron turnover. Two of three control subjects also had increased erythron iron turnovers, which in one case was related to increased dialysis-associated blood losses. Changes in RBC mass were not consistently paralleled by changes in Hb. These findings suggest that increases in RBC mass during nandrolone decanoate therapy result from two mechanisms: increased erythropoiesis (shown by simultaneous increases in RBC mass and erythron iron turnover) and increased RBC survival (indirectly shown by increases in RBC mass without increases in erythron iron turnover). The importance of control groups, RBC mass determinations and the monitoring of dialysis-associated blood losses in studying the effects of androgens on erythropoiesis in chronic hemodialysis patients is also demonstrated.","1988","Acta haematologica",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Papatheofanis F. et al.","OBJECTIVE: Few observational studies have evaluated the use of epoetin alfa (EPO) and darbepoetin alfa (DARB) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with anemia. The objective of this study was to investigate dosing patterns, hematologic outcomes, and intervention costs with EPO and DARB in anemic CKD patients treated in an ambulatory care setting. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, chart review of predialysis CKD patients with anemia treated with EPO or DARB. Charts were sequentially selected from 435 EPO and 432 DARB patients naive to erythropoietic therapy and treated for > or = 24 weeks. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, dates, and EPO/DARB doses were recorded. Drug costs using 2005 wholesale acquisition costs (WAC) and Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing were based on the mean cumulative drug dose over the 24-week study period. RESULTS: A total of 393 EPO and 396 DARB charts met all criteria with predominantly male subjects (EPO: 94%; DARB: 96%). Mean baseline GFR and Hb levels were similar. Once-weekly and extended dosing (> or = Q2W) was common in both groups. At Weeks 4, 8, and 12 following initiation of therapy, a greater proportion of EPO than DARB patients reached target Hb levels (> or = 11 g/dL) (p < 0.0001); at Week 24, all patients reached target Hb levels. Mean 24-week cumulative doses were EPO 279 336 +/- 68 302 units and DARB 1084 +/- 246 microg. Drug cost was higher for DARB independent of pricing utilized (WAC: EPO = 3400 US dollars, DARB = 4726 US dollars; FSS: EPO = 1528 US dollars, DARB = 2379 US dollars).

","Macdougall I. et al.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Peginesatide is a synthetic, PEGylated, investigational, peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. We report the first assessment of its efficacy and safety in correcting renal anemia in a population of 139 nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Chronic kidney disease patients who were not on dialysis and not receiving treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the 12 weeks before study drug administration were sequentially assigned to one of 10 cohorts; cohorts differed in starting peginesatide dose (different body weight-based or absolute doses), route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous), and frequency of administration (every 4 or 2 weeks). RESULTS: Across all cohorts, 96% of patients achieved a hemoglobin response. A dose-response relationship was evident for hemoglobin increase. Comparable subcutaneous and intravenous peginesatide doses produced similar hemoglobin responses. Rapid rates of hemoglobin rise and hemoglobin excursions >13 g/dl tended to occur more frequently with every-2-weeks dosing than they did with every-4-weeks dosing. The range of final median doses in the every-4-weeks dosing groups was 0.019 to 0.043 mg/kg. Across all cohorts, 20% of patients reported serious adverse events (one patient had a possibly drug-related serious event) and 81% reported adverse events (11.5% reported possibly drug-related events); these events were consistent with those routinely observed in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that peginesatide administered every 4 weeks can increase and maintain hemoglobin in nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients. Additional long-term data in larger groups of patients are required to further elucidate the efficacy and safety of this peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating agent.","2011","Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Peginesatide is a synthetic , PEGylated , investigational , peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

LI","Pellegrino A. et al.","Iron deficiency afflicts about 60% of dialysis patients and about 30% of non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients (ND-CKD). The role of iron deficiency in determining anemia in CKD patients is so relevant that guidelines from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) initiative recommend treating it before starting with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. KDIGO guidelines suggest oral iron therapy because it is commonly available and inexpensive, although it is often characterized by low bioavailability and low compliance due to adverse effects. A new-generation oral iron therapy is now available and seems to be promising. We therefore conducted a study to determine whether an association of iron sucrose, folic acid and vitamins C, B6, B12, can improve anemia in ND-CKD patients, stage 3-5. Our study shows that iron sucrose is a safe and effective oral iron therapy and that it is capable of correcting anemia in ND-CKD patients, although it does not seem to replete low iron stores.","2021","Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter 52-week study (evaluation period, weeks 20-32), a subanalysis of the Simplify the Treatment of Anemia with Aranesp study, enrolled patients with CKD who were not receiving dialysis (creatinine clearance < or =70 mL/min or estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < or =60 mL/min). Patients evaluated in this analysis were not receiving ESPs, had hemoglobin concentrations less than 11 g/dL, and had transferrin saturation of 20% or higher during screening. Patients Initiated every-other-week darbepoetin alfa therapy at 0.75 microg/kg, with the dose subsequently titrated to maintain hemoglobin levels not to exceed 12 g/dL.

","Disney A. et al.","AIM: Darbepoetin alfa, an erythropoiesis-stimulating protein, has a longer serum half-life than recombinant human erythropoietin, allowing less-frequent administration. This study aimed to demonstrate that once-monthly (QM) darbepoetin alfa administration would maintain haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis who had previously been administered darbepoetin alfa every 2 weeks (Q2W). METHODS: This was a multicentre study in which subjects with CKD receiving stable Q2W darbepoetin alfa doses and with stable Hb (100-130 g/L) were started on QM darbepoetin alfa dosing. The initial QM darbepoetin alfa dose was equivalent to the cumulative darbepoetin alfa dose administered during the month preceding enrollment. Darbepoetin alfa doses were titrated to maintain Hb concentrations between 100 and 130 g/L. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects maintaining mean Hb >or= 100 g/L during the evaluation period (weeks 21-33). RESULTS: Sixty-six subjects were enrolled in the study and all received at least one dose of darbepoetin alfa; 55 (83%) had mean Hb >or= 100 g/L during evaluation. Mean (SD) Hb concentrations at baseline and during the evaluation period were 119 (8.7) g/L and 114 (9.8) g/L, respectively. The median QM darbepoetin alfa dose at baseline and during the evaluation period was 80 microg. Darbepoetin alfa was considered to be well-tolerated.

The guidelines are the result of investigations and conclusions of professional societies, and legal regulations and insurance agencies use professional societies guidelines for their purposes. Target haemoglobin concentration that is recommended in American, European and our national guidelines is within 120 to 120 g/L and should not be higher. Asmall number of patients are able to maintain this concentration, because of the comorbide conditions and other factors that effect haemoglobin stability. Poor outcomes are possible in patients whose haemoglobin concentration is higher than recommended but mortality is also higher in patients whose haemoglobin concentration is lower than the target for a longer period of time.

","Ravani P. et al.","BACKGROUND: The current 3rd edition of the Italian Society of Nephrology guidelines has been drawn up to summarize evidence of key intervention issues on the basis of Systematic Reviews (SR) of Randomized Trials (RCT) or RCT data only. The present guideline reports evidence of the use of Erythropoietins (EPO) and/or optimal haemoglobin (Hgb) targets to delay Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression. METHODS: SR of RCT and RCT on EPO and different Hgb targets in CKD (pre-dialysis) were identified searching in the Cochrane Library and Renal Health Library (2005 update). Quality of SR and RCT was assessed according to current methodological standards. RESULTS: Two SR (15 RCT) and 5 further RCT were found addressing the intervention issue. No significant evidence supporting the use of EPO compared with placebo/no treatment to prevent or delay CKD progression was found (evidence from SR). Progression rates do not appear to be affected by Hgb targets (evidence from SR). Methodological quality of included RCT was suboptimal. In diabetic patients not receiving renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors, early EPO treatment (when Hgb ≥9 g/dL) with target Hgb ≥13 g/dL as compared to delayed treatment initiation (Hgb < 9 g/dL) is associated with reduced risk of disease progression, end-stage renal disease and death (evidence from RCT). CONCLUSION: In CKD patients not undergoing dialysis current evidence does not support the hypothesis that EPO treatment or optimal Hgb targets reduce the progression rate of the disease. Further studies are necessary to test this hypothesis in selected patient populations.","2007","Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

However, clinical guidelines on erythrocyte stimulating agents (erythropoietin : EPO) for such patients have not been established. Current clinical practice for EPO administration is based on the recommendations of the Japanese health insurance regulations, which have not always been supported by clinical evidence. MATERIALS & METHODS: The study subjects were 49 patients with CKD staged above 3 who had developed renal anemia requiring EPO. These patients were treated with EPO S. C. at the dose of 6,000 IU/week together with iron supplementation as deemed necessary for more than 24 weeks. RESULTS: The hemoglobin (Hb) value was 9.2 +/- 1.0 g/dL at the start, 10.9 +/- 1.6 g/dL at the peak (n = 49, p < 0.001 the start vs. the peak), and 9.0 +/- 1.6 g/dL at the commencement of dialysis (n = 49, p < 0.001 the peak vs. the commencement of dialysis). Seventy-one percent (35/49) of the patients achieved Hb levels over 10 g/dL, and 51% (25/49) achieved Hb levels over 11 g/dL. Conversely, 28% (14/49) of the patients failed to reach an Hb level over 10 g/dL. Factors explaining the good response to EPO (good responders were defined as those achieving Hb levels over 11 g/dL) had shown high Hb levels at the start (Logistic multiple regression analysis, p = 0.03) along with low creatinine concentration at the start (Cox's proportional hazard models, p = 0.015). Transferrin saturation (TSAT) at the start was 33.6 +/- 13.6%, 34.0 +/- 19.9% at the peak, and 24.7 +/- 11.6% at the commencement of dialysis, showing a significant reduction in TSAT at the commencement of dialysis compared to that at the start (n = 49, p = 0.0383, the start vs. the commencement of dialysis). Serum ferritin concentration was 140.7 +/- 139.5 pg/mL at the start, 107.9 +/- 110.8 pg/mL at the peak, and 131.9 +/- 112.4 pg/mL at the commencement of dialysis, indicating an absence of significant differences among the three time points. CONCLUSION: The current health insurance regulations in Japan seem to be inappropriate in that the permitted EPO dosage of 6,000 IU/week might not be sufficient to achieve the target Hb level of more than 11 g/dL in most patients with CKD. To more efficiently achieve renoprotection, both early and timely initiation of EPO and reconsideration of the recommended EPO dosage appear to be warranted.","2007","Nihon Jinzo Gakkai shi"," OBJECTIVE : Patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) are frequently complicated by renal anemia as renal function declines ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Levin A. et al.","Haemoglobin (Hgb) levels are known to be associated with numerous adverse outcomes in both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and non-CKD patients. This analysis evaluates the association of baseline haemoglobin levels on survival in CKD patients, who are followed by nephrologists, irrespective of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), prior to initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and erythropoietin hormone replacement therapy. Analysis of data from the provincial database (PROMIS, Patient Registration and Outcome Management Information System) in British Columbia, Canada, was undertaken. Records used for the analysis included all CKD patients at first registration: GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), not yet on dialysis, starting from May 1998 to October 2002, and who had complete data (defined as age and gender, diabetic status, eGFR and Hgb levels). The primary objective of this study was to determine the association of Hgb and survival controlling for eGFR at first registration value, age, gender and diabetic status. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis with time to death as outcome variable was performed. The cohort included 3028 patients: the mean age was 65 years, 28% were diabetic, and the mean eGFR in the cohort was 21 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The cohort is representative of the BC CKD and dialysis population regarding ethnicity: 64% Caucasian, 32% Asian. Median follow-up was 27 months, 1 year survival was 0.92, 2 year survival was 0.85. Hgb at initial registration is a statistically independent predictor of survival (RR = 0.875 for every 10 g/l, 95% CI: 0.835-0.917, P = 0.0001), after adjusting for age, gender, diabetic status and baseline eGFR. Further analysis, controlling for RRT, demonstrated a similar association between Hgb and survival (RR = 0.853 for every 10 g/l, 95% CI: 0.799-0.910, P = 0.0001), after adjusting for above variables. Substantial variation in Hgb values exists at all GFR levels. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating Hgb at all GFR levels, and the need to study the impact of modification of Hgb at different GFR levels on survival.","2006","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association"," The primary objective of this study was to determine the association of Hgb and survival controlling for eGFR at first registration value , age , gender and diabetic status ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Canavese C. et al.","BACKGROUND: The current 3rd edition of the Italian Society of Nephrology guidelines has been drawn up to summarize evidence of key intervention issues on the basis of systematic reviews (SR) of randomized trials (RCT) or RCT data only. In the present guideline, evidence of optimal haemoglobin (Hb) target levels in chronic kidney disease (CKD), either for pre-dialysis, dialysis or renal transplanted patients, is presented. METHODS: SR of RCT and RCT on different Hb target levels in patients with CKD were identified, referring to a Cochrane Library and Renal Health Library search (2005 update). Quality of SR and RCT was assessed according to current methodological standards. RESULTS: Four SR (19 RCT) were found addressing the point. Methodological quality of available trials was suboptimal. In CKD patients (non-dialysis patients) Hb targets of 11.3 g/dL should be preferred to Hb >13.5 g/dL (evidence from RCT). A Hb target of 11.0-11.5 g/dL should be preferred in CKD patients receiving dialysis treatment without significant cardiac disease, since no survival benefits has been showed with Hb >14 g/dL (evidence from RCT). The optimal Hb target in haemodialysis patients with severe cardiac disease should be 10.0-10.5 g/dL (evidence from SR). Increases in Hb target lev-els are associated with improved quality of life, although this was mainly noticed in observational studies and in few RCT often relying on unvalidated quality of life assessment scales. CONCLUSION: In CKD patients current available evidence supports the hypothesis that optimal Hb targets should be low to subnormal.","2007","Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Treatment of renal anemia is possible with all erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Newer formulations may cause less hemoglobin variations and prolonged treatment interval.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the study the results of anemia treatment with darbepoetin alfa and erythropoietin beta were analyzed in respectively 35 and 20 patients during 11 months, and its influence on blood pressure and the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease. After 2 months of darbepoetin alfa treatment 10 mg/month and after 4 months of darbepoetin alfa treatment 20 mg/month the hemoglobin target serum levels in male and female patients were reached. In 3 patients the hemoglobin serum level was increased over 13 g/dl and was stable up to the end of treatment. During 11 months observation the value of blood pressure was not changed. Similarly, a creatinine serum level was stable in females but increased in males. Therapy with darbepoetin alfa was well tolerated, however some patients were complained for subcutaneous injection pain. RESULTS: After erythropoietin beta treatment 2000 IU/week the hemoglobin target level in serum was achieved in 3 females after 9 months and 7 males after 6 months. In 3 patients, in one male after 6 months and two females after 8 months the hemoglobin serum levels were increased over 13 g/dl and was stable up to the end of treatment.

DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Twenty-seven long-term care facilities in Colorado. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Had > 90-day residency in the long-term care facility; had index serum creatinine and hemoglobin (Hb) values ± 90 days of the earliest (index) Minimum Data Set (MDS). Data were derived from the AnalytiCare(sm) database (January 1, 2007-September 15, 2008) containing laboratory results, MDS reports, and pharmacy fills. Residents with laboratory-defined CKD had estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Those with laboratory-defined anemia had < 12 g/dL Hb females, < 13 g/dL Hb males. MDS reports indicated recognition of CKD and anemia. Prescription records identified anemia-related pharmacotherapy for anemic residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence rates of laboratory-defined CKD and anemia, recognition rates of anemia and CKD, and rates of use of specific anemia pharmacotherapies. RESULTS: For 838 eligible residents, laboratory findings showed a prevalence rate of 43% for CKD and 46% for anemia. Only 2.8% and 14.6% of residents with laboratory defined CKD had CKD recognized on the index, or any index or postindex MDS, respectively. Anemia recognition rates were 9.6% and 39.9%, respectively. No single anemia prescription therapy class (erythropoiesis stimulating agents, iron, vitamin B(12), or folic acid) was used for more than 10% of all residents with laboratory- or MDS-defined anemia.

SETTING: University-affiliated, division of nephrology, outpatient multidisciplinary model CKD clinic headed by a clinical pharmacist. PATIENTS: One hundred sixty-six patients with anemia of CKD who were referred by nephrologists and primary care providers to the multidisciplinary clinic from March 1, 2002-July 31, 2004. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients received darbepoetin alfa dosed on an every-other-week basis. If patients were already receiving once-weekly recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO), the darbepoetin alfa dose was calculated by using the darbepoetin alfa package insert conversion table. If patients were naïve to previous erythropoietic therapy, the darbepoetin alfa dose was either 60 microg or 0.7 microg/kg. The dose and frequency of darbepoetin alfa and oral iron supplements were adjusted to achieve the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) targets for hemoglobin levels and iron measures. The primary outcome analyzed was the proportion of patients with at least 30 days of treatment who achieved a target hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dl or greater. Of 128 patients who received at least 30 days of treatment, 100 (78%) attained the hemoglobin level (mean +/- SD 11.7 +/- 7 g/dl). Ninety-nine of 128 patients were originally naïve to erythropoietic therapy; 77 (78%) of these 99 patients achieved the hemoglobin target in a mean +/- SD of 7.9 +/- 7.5 weeks. These data contrast with the data of 29 patients seen in the year previous to the reengineered clinic process, whereby only 12 (41%) of these comparable patients reached hemoglobin target with r-HuEPO therapy. Of the 77 previously erythropoietic-naïve patients, 82% were receiving darbepoetin alfa every other week, 14% every 3 weeks, and 4% every 4 weeks at the time the hemoglobin target was achieved. Oral iron administration significantly increased the chance of achieving the K/DOQI targets for hemoglobin and iron.

Despite comprehensive investigations in several cases, definite causes of anemia frequently remain unknown. Our study aimed to analyze the factors that possibly affect anemia in CKD patients who were referred for hematology consultation. A total of 87 patients were retrospectively included in the cohort. Forty-four cases were excluded, including 30 cases with unavailable intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) data, 11 cases with bone marrow diseases (8 Pure red cell aplasia, 3 Myelodysplastic syndrome) and 3 cases with thalassemia. In total, 43 patients were analyzed. Patients with high iPTH had a significantly lower Hemoglobin (Hb) level and required a higher dose of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) compared with the normal iPTH group (Hb 8.29 vs 9.24 mg/dL, P=0.032 and ESAs dose of 16,352.94 vs. 12,444.44 U/week, P=0.024). Univariate, followed by stepwise multivariate analysis was performed and determined that serum phosphate (PO4) was significantly associated with lower Hb level (P=0.01 and P=0.013, respectively). In addition, Hb level was inversely correlated with iPTH and serum phosphate (PO4) level (r=-0.54, P<0.001 and r=-0.47, P=0.005; respectively). Mineral disequilibrium is an important factor associated with anemia in ESA hyporesponsive CKD. Also, hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism are significantly correlated with low Hb. As a result, we strongly suggest correction of mineral disequilibrium factors prior to performing bone marrow study.","2019","Hematology reports"," Our study aimed to analyze the factors that possibly affect anemia in CKD patients who were referred for hematology consultation ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Gilmartin C.","PURPOSE: Barriers to the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the role of pharmacists in screening patients for anemia and developing guidelines for the use of anemia therapies in patients with CKD, the goals of and considerations in developing pharmacist-managed anemia management clinics, and the potential benefits of these clinics are described. SUMMARY: The complexity of patients with CKD, patient nonadherence to the treatment regimen, a shortage of nephrologists, and a lack of familiarity with clinical practice guidelines and recommendations for treating anemia in these patients are possible barriers to the treatment of anemia. Pharmacists can play a role in improving the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD by screening for anemia, developing guidelines for the use of anemia therapies, and providing patient education to promote adherence to the treatment regimen. The optimal upper limit for hemoglobin concentration during treatment with erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESA) in patients with CKD remains to be determined, but it should not routinely exceed 13.0 g/dL. Extended dosing of darbepoetin alfa and the new agent continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator appears effective. Iron status often is not assessed in patients with CKD because of difficulty interpreting iron laboratory values and identifying iron deficiency. The usefulness of iron supplementation is not limited to patients with iron deficiency. The intravenous (i.v.) or oral route of administration may be used for iron supplementation in predialysis patients and peritoneal dialysis patients, but the i.v. route is recommended for hemodialysis patients. Adverse effects and drug interactions limit the use of oral iron supplements. Administration of parenteral iron is time consuming and accompanied by concerns about iron accumulation and uncertainty about the optimal maximum serum ferritin concentration. Improved access to care and clinical outcomes and reduced costs have been documented in pharmacist-managed anemia management clinics. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can help overcome barriers to treating anemia in patients with CKD. Clinical and economic benefits are associated with pharmacist-managed anemia management clinics.","2007","American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists"," PURPOSE : Barriers to the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , the role of pharmacists in screening patients for anemia and developing guidelines for the use of anemia therapies in patients with CKD , the goals of and considerations in developing pharmacist-managed anemia management","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Portolés J. et al.","BACKGROUND/AIM: There is little information on the development of anemia in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the onset of renal anemia in a cohort of initially nonanemic chronic kidney disease patients followed up in nephrology clinics. METHODS: This epidemiological, prospective, three-year, multicenter study enrolled patients aged 18-78 years with stage 3 chronic kidney disease without anemia. Interim analysis was performed on the data collected during the first 12 months. RESULTS: The study included 432 patients, average age 63.6 years (range 22-78 years, 70% male). The main etiologies of chronic kidney disease were glomerular (11.6%), interstitial (10.4%), vascular (29.4%), and diabetic (16.9%). The percentages of patients with comorbidities were 33.8% diabetes (2.5% type 1), 69% dyslipidemia, and 93% hypertension. During the first year, 12.4% of patients developed anemia. The chronic kidney disease progression rate was low: proteinuria was 0.46 +/- 0.8 g/24 h at one year versus 0.67 +/- 1.0 g/24 h at baseline. Diabetic patients showed a greater prevalence of previous cardiovascular events (50.0% vs. 24.5%) and worse control of some modifiable cardiovascular risk factors: smoking (13.4% vs. 8.6%), obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2), 33.6% vs. 25.3%), target blood pressure (<130/80 mmHg, 21.0% vs. 27.9%), and proteinuria (0.8 +/- 1.1 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.9 g/day). CONCLUSIONS: After one year, 12.4% of patients developed anemia. Diabetic patients had a higher cardiovascular risk and limited blood pressure control.

The influence of this genetic variant on susceptibility to iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is unknown. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we measured the full blood count and TMPRSS6 T>C polymorphism in black adult participants (n=260) with CKD and healthy controls (n=146) at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of anaemia in the CKD and control population was 46.9% and 19.6% respectively. Twenty-six per cent of CKD participants were iron deficient. The prevalence of rs855791 C homozygosity was similar among iron deficient and non-iron deficient anaemia groups (86.1% vs 84.2%, P=0.723). When the analysis was confined to subjects with or without functional iron deficiency anaemia, C homozygote (88.3% vs 84.4%, P=0.425) was similar for both groups.

New agents under development to pharmacologically manipulate HIF may provide new and exciting possibilities in the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as well as in multiple other disease states involving ischemia-reperfusion injury. This article provides an overview of recent studies describing current standards of care for patients with anemia in CKD and associated clinical issues, and those supporting the clinical potential for targeting HIF stabilization with HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHI) in these patients. Additionally, articles reporting the clinical potential for HIF-PHIs in 'other' putative therapeutic areas, the tissue and intracellular distribution of HIF- and prolyl-hydroxylase domain (PHD) isoforms, and HIF isoforms targeted by the different PHDs, were identified. There is increasing uncertainty regarding the optimal treatment for anemia of CKD with poorer outcomes associated with treatment to higher hemoglobin targets, and the increasing use of iron and consequent risk of iron imbalance. Attainment and maintenance of more physiologic erythropoietin levels associated with HIF stabilization may improve the management of patients resistant to treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and improve outcomes at higher hemoglobin targets.","2018","International journal of molecular sciences",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Compared to ELISA, inherent imprecision was higher on the PC biosensor for ferritin, but not for sTfR. High SE or RE in the PC biosensor when measuring either biomarker resulted in TEcalc higher than the TEa.

","Martinez-Vea A. et al.","BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress (OS) is involved in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Short-term treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicated by anemia and LVH is associated with a reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM). We proposed to assess whether the pro-oxidant status of CKD influences these outcomes. METHODS: Predialysis patients (n = 76) with CKD and hemoglobin (Hb) levels < 11 g/dl received EPO for 6 months. The effects of this anemia correction on LVH regression were evaluated using echocardiography. Patients with LVM decrease > 10% were considered ""responders"" (n = 25) to treatment and those with LVM change < 10% were considered ""non-responders"" (n = 24). Measurement of OS included plasma and erythrocyte oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione, GSH redox ratio (GSSG/GSH), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and oxidized LDL (Ox- LDL). RESULTS: 49 patients completed the study. With EPO therapy, mean Hb levels increased from 9.9 ± 0.6 to 12.8 ± 1.5 g/ dl (p < 0.0001) and LVM index decreased from 69.2 ± 17.7 to 64.1 ± 19.6 g/m2.7 (p = 0.01). At 6 months, ""non-responders"" had higher systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, GSSG and GSH redox ratio and lower GSH than ""responders"". In multivariate analysis, and following adjustment for confounding variables, systolic blood pressure and GSH redox ratio independently predicted LVH regression. CONCLUSION: Blood pressure and plasma GSH redox ratio (a marker of OS) are important predictors of LVH regression in anemic predialysis patients treated with EPO.","2012","Clinical nephrology","BACKGROUND / AIM : Oxidative stress ( OS ) is involved in left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: We conducted retrospective analysis of the changes in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels; transferrin saturation; the estimated glomerular filtration rate; and the urinary protein/creatinine ratio over 24 weeks after the change from an ESA to roxadustat in 50 patients with non-dialysis CKD and anemia (roxadustat group). Seventy-two patients with non-dialysis CKD and anemia who proceeded ESA therapy were used as the control (ESA) group. RESULTS: We observed no significant between-group differences in clinical parameters at baseline except for the significantly lower hemoglobin concentration and lower proportion of diabetes mellitus in the roxadustat group. The hemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in the roxadustat group after 24 weeks (11.3 ± 1.2 versus 10.3 ± 1.0 g/dL; value of p < 0.05), whereas the transferrin saturation, ferritin concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urinary protein/creatinine ratio were not different between the two groups. TC (135.9 ± 40.0 versus 165.3 ± 38.4 mg/dL; value of p < 0.05), LDL-C (69.1 ± 28.3 versus 87.2 ± 31.5 mg/dL; value of p < 0.05), HDL-C (41.4 ± 13.5 versus 47.2 ± 15.3 mg/dL; value of p < 0.05), and triglyceride concentrations (101.5 ± 52.7 versus 141.6 ± 91.4 mg/dL, value of p < 0.05) were significantly lower in the roxadustat group compared with the ESA group at 24 weeks. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the roxadustat dose at baseline (standard coefficient [β] = 0.280, value of p = 0.043) was correlated with the change in the hemoglobin levels during the first 4 weeks of roxadustat treatment, whereas age (β = 0.319, value of p = 0.017) and the roxadustat dose at 24 weeks (β = -0.347, value of p = 0.010) were correlated with the hemoglobin concentration after 24 weeks of roxadustat administration. CONCLUSION: Roxadustat can improve anemia and reduce serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in non-dialysis CKD patients after the patients' treatment was switched from an ESA without affecting renal function or proteinuria. These results indicate that roxadustat has superior effects to ESAs regarding anemia and lipid metabolism at the dose selected for the comparison in patients with non-dialysis CKD.","2023","Frontiers in medicine",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Anemia was defined as follows: hematocrit level <40% in men, <32% in women aged <50 years, and <35% in women aged >or=50 years. GFR was estimated using a new Japanese equation: eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) = 194 x serum creatinine(1.094) x age(0.287) x 0.739 (if female). RESULTS: The prevalence of anemia clearly increased as CKD progressed below an eGFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in both genders.

This study systematically reviews and investigates the efficacy and safety of vadadustat in the anemia treatment with different duration in both nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) and dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD). METHODS: Several main databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting vadadustat vs darbepoetin alfa for anemia patients with CKD. The outcome indicators were focused on hemoglobin (Hb), the percentage of patients within the target Hb, the need for RBC (Red Blood Cell) transfusions, and serious adverse events (SAEs). RESULTS: Four eligible studies with 8,026 participants were included. The changes of Hb levels from the baseline in the darbepoetin alfa group were significantly higher than that in the vadadustat group with DD-CKD (mean difference (MD) - 0.19, [95% confidence interval (CI), - 0.21 to - 0.17], p < 0.0001). In NDD-CKD patients, the changes of Hb levels in the two groups are not significantly different (MD = - 0.06, [95% CI, - 0.18 to 0.05], p = 0.006), especially, during the treatment duration of 20-36 weeks (MD = 0.02, [95% CI, - 0.04 to 0.08], p = 0.51).

SUMMARY: The NKF recommendations for ESA use are general and include dosing based on the measured and target hemoglobin concentrations, the rate of increase in hemoglobin, and clinical circumstances, with the route and frequency of administration determined by the CKD stage, treatment setting, efficacy, and ESA class. A serum ferritin concentration of 100-500 ng/mL is the target during oral and intravenous (i.v.) iron therapy for predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, but use of the i.v. route of administration and a target serum ferritin concentration of 200-500 ng/mL is recommended for hemodialysis patients by NKF. Iron deficiency and inflammation are possible causes of inadequate response to ESAs. The safety profile of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are similar, but the longer half-life of darbepoetin alfa permits administration on a once-monthly basis in patients with CKD and anemia. Extended dosing of CERA also appears safe and effective in dialysis patients with CKD. Several investigational anemia therapies with a variety of mechanisms of action are in development.

A questionnaire was sent to the medical directors of the 174 active dialysis centers in the KSA including centers under the Ministry of Health (MOH) (67 %), the governmental non-MOH sector (12%) and private hospitals (21 %) that together care for a population of more than 11,300 chronic dialysis patients. The study was performed between November 2008 and March 2009. A total of 143 of the 174 (82.1%) medical directors answered the questionnaire. This covered 9563 (84%) dialysis patients in the KSA. There were 95 (68.8%) respondents who believed that the mechanism of action of ESAs is due to both blood concentration and direct action on the stem cells that form red cells. Only 81 (57%) respondents believed that the half-life of the short-acting ESAs is less than one day, 67 (46.9%) believed the half-life of darbepoetin is 2-4 days, and 52 (36.6%) believed the half-life of CERA is 5-10 days; 79 (55.6%) respondents believed that the interval of dosing of darbepoetin is once biweekly, and 92 (71.9%) believed that the interval of dosing of CERA is once a month. There were 110 (76.9%) respondents who believed the CKD should receive a long-acting than short-acting ESAs for the more stable hemoglobin levels, 64 (44.8%) believed that pharmacodynamics of the CERA are better than other ESAs and warrant its use over all of them, and 115 (80.6%) believed that the target hemoglobin is 11-13 g/dL in CKD patients is well established. Finally, 65 (51.5%) respondents would request more than 30% of the stock of ESAs in the future as short-acting ESAs vs 71 (55%) for darbepoetin and 40 (37.4%) for CERA.

,"35559232"," The Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat for Anemia in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Meta-Analysis. ","Wang L. et al.","Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem, and anemia is a common complication in CKD patients. Roxadustat (FG-4592) is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizer. Roxadustat has been shown in studies to keep up with and increase hemoglobin better than placebo or erythropoietin. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of roxadustat. Methods: We searched CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Database, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients. The papers were screened using rigorous criteria and their quality was assessed using the Cochrane 5.1.0 assessment manual for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RevMan 5.3 was used to extract and synthesize data for meta-analysis. Results: There were 8 RCTs (7 articles) in all, and 1,364 patients with chronic kidney disease anemia were involved. The overall quality of the studies included was satisfactory. The meta-analysis findings revealed that roxadustat can considerably enhance hemoglobin, transferrin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in both dialysis-dependent (DD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) patients: Hemoglobin (Hb): DD: [SMD = 0.23, 95% CI (0.01, 0.44), p = 0.04], NDD: [SMD = 2.08, 95% CI (1.23, 2.93) p < 0.000001]; transferrin: DD: [SMD = 0.78, 95% CI (0.24, 1.32), p = 0.004], NDD: [SMD = 1.37, 95% CI (0.76, 1.98), p < 0.0001]; TIBC: DD [SMD = 0.97, 95% CI (0.64, 1.29), p < 0.00001], NDD [SMD = 1.34, 95% CI (0.9, 1.78), p < 0.00001]. After roxadustat therapy, patients' serum iron levels were considerably higher in the dialysis group than in the control group, but there was no significant change in the NDD group [SMD = 0.42, 95% CI (0.27, 0.57), p < 0.00001]. In the NDD group, hepcidin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were significantly reduced after roxadustat treatment: Hepcidin [SMD = -1.59, 95% CI (-2.69, -0.49), p = 0.005], ferritin [SMD = -0.51, 95% CI (-0.72, 0.3) p < 0.00001], TSAT [SMD = -0.41, 95% CI (-0.62, 0.2), p < 0.0001]. In terms of safety, adverse events (AE) [SMD = 1.08, 95% CI (0.98, 1.18) p = 0.11] and serious adverse events (SAE) [SMD = 1.32, 95% CI (0.97, 1.9) p = 0.08] were not significantly different between the two groups.

","Gupta N. and Wish J.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: First generation erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have short duration of action which requires administration once weekly or greater. Second generation ESAs were developed which have longer duration of action and can be administered one to two times monthly. Erythropoietin (EPO) mimetic peptides (EMPs) activate the EPO receptor but have no structural analogy to EPO, offering the potential for lower cost as they are not biologic drugs. The first approved EMP, peginesatide, was withdrawn from the market within a year of its approval because of fatal anaphylactic reactions. In this review, we summarize recent progress regarding the development of newer, possibly less toxic, EMPs. We also summarize the development of EPO fusion proteins which fuse EPO with a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule or another EPO molecule, achieving a longer duration of action and less frequent dosing. RECENT FINDINGS: AGEM400(hydroxyethyl starch) and pegolsihematide are EMPs in phase II clinical trials. Three EPO fusion proteins are under development, two in phase I and one in phase II. SUMMARY: The future success of EMPs is limited by the prior experience with peginesatide and EPO fusion proteins do not offer cost savings or longer duration of action than currently available ESAs.","2018","Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : First generation erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have short duration of action which requires administration once weekly or greater ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kępska-Dzilińska M. et al.","The hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is performed for various hematological diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs relatively often after HSCT. Anemia after HSCT may be due to CKD and/or other reasons. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of anemia and its possible relationship to the presence of CKD in patients at least 3 months after HSCT. The study included 156 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT treatment in our center in the years 1998 to 2021 due to different hematologic pathologies (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and others). Anemia was diagnosed in 13% of women and 35% of men. Anemia was most common in people after HSCT due to a history of acute myeloid leukemia (55% women, 30% men). In 56% of women and 17% of men, anemia was associated with chronic kidney disease. In patients with anemia, age was related to the eGFR (r = -0.39, p < 0.001), in patients without anemia age was negatively related to eGFR (r = -0.56, p < 0.001), and hemoglobin was positively related to platelet count (r = 0.62, p < 0.001). Concluding, anemia, was relatively common in CKD after HSCT.

","Nand N. et al.","BACKGROUND: Hyporesponse to erythropoietin is a common problem seen in around 5-10% of patients. Recently the focus from these remediable factors has been shifted to the non-modifiable innate factors i.e polymorphism of ACE and IL-1B gene and studies have shown that DD genotype and IL-1B CC genotype have lower erythropoietin requirement. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of ACE and IL-1B gene polymorphisms in erythropoietin hyporesponse in CKD patients with anemia. METHODS: A total of 50 patients were selected. After taking pre-informed written consent, they were segregated into two groups, group A and B with 25 patients in each group. Group A included CKD stage III-IV patients and Group B included CKD stage V patients who were on regular maintenance. All patients were given erythroepoietin and response was monitored using erythropoietin resistance index (ERI). Genotyping of ACE and IL-1B genes were done and serum levels of ACE and IL-1B were measured. Mean values of ERI were compared between different genotype subgroups and analysed using binary regression analysis. RESULTS: The study group included 6 patients with diabetic nephropathy and out of these 4(66.6%) had DD genotype. On comparing the effect of ACE polymorphism on ERI levels it was seen that the mean ERI values in DD subgroup were significantly lower (16.97±5.35, 21.88±6.25, 22.69±8.35 at 1,3 and 5th month) as compared to ID (18.16±3.39, 24.17±3.66, 32.74±9.95 and II (20.73±5.17, 27.74±7.30, 41.08±13.83 U/Kg/g/dL). In the case of IL-1B the mean ERI values were lowest in the TT subgroup (16.46±4.45, 21.96±5.77,23.98±8.48) as compared to CC (19.49 ±5.62,25.46±7.07, 33.59±12.61) and CT (18.12±4.27,24.14±5.70, 31.89±13.83 U/Kg/g/dL). The mean serum values of ACE were in a decreasing trend i.e DD> ID> II (238.05 ± 52.46, 194.73±50.28 and 162.99±39.71 ng/ml, (p < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: D allele positively affected the serum ACE level but there was no association between IL-1B genotype and its levels.

","London R. et al.","BACKGROUND: Limited information exists on resource utilization patterns and overall patient management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) before the initiation of dialysis therapy. METHODS: A retrospective claims analysis from January 1997 to December 1999 was conducted using a managed care database on 1,936 incident dialysis patients, examining the 12 months preceding dialysis initiation to evaluate whether managed care patients with CKD are receiving expected interventions and appropriate management of CKD. RESULTS: Mean age was 66.8 years, 46% were women, 91.2% had claims for facility services, 97.6% had claims for professional services, and 95.7% had claims for outpatient pharmacy, with mean costs per patient of $26,204, $9,623, and $1,503, respectively. Sixty-two percent of patients were hospitalized, averaging 1.3 admissions annually ($14,818/admission; average, 7.8 d/admission). Despite high overall resource use, treatments for preparation for dialysis therapy, appropriate tests, and nutritional supplements (eg, phosphate binders, B-complex combinations, and vitamins with iron) were administered infrequently. Comorbid conditions, such as anemia (47.4%) and diabetes (53%), were appropriately addressed with erythropoietin (10.5%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (38%) in only a minority of cases. In preparation for dialysis therapy, only 20.8% underwent a vascular access procedure. CONCLUSION: Although patients consumed significant amounts of resources during the 12 months before dialysis initiation, many were not using expected resources for the appropriate management of CKD.

","Kim H. et al.","BACKGROUND: Adiponectin is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes. A low adiponectin level is a significant risk factor of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown that adiponectin is negatively associated with hematopoiesis and predicts the development of anemia in the general population. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, circulating adiponectin level is paradoxically elevated and the role of adiponectin is complex. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between adiponectin and anemia in these patients. METHODS: This prospective longitudinal study included 2113 patients from the KNOW-CKD study (KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With CKD), after excluding 125 without data on adiponectin levels. Hemoglobin levels were measured yearly during a mean follow-up period of 23.7 months. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels of <13.0 and 12.0 g/dL for men and women, respectively. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 53.6 ± 12.2 years, and 1289 (61%) were men. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 50.4 ± 30.2 mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2). Serum adiponectin level was inversely associated with body mass index, eGFR, log-transformed C-reactive protein, and positively with Charlson comorbidity index, urine protein to creatinine ratio, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition, serum adiponectin level was also negatively correlated with hemoglobin level and reticulocyte production index in both men and women. In multivariable linear regression analysis after adjustment of multiple confounders, adiponectin was negatively associated with hemoglobin (men, β = -0.219, P < .001; women, β = -0.09, P = .025). Among 1227 patients without anemia at baseline, 307 newly developed anemia during the follow-up period. In multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjustment of confounders, high adiponectin level was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident anemia (per 1 µg/mL increase, hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.04; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: A high serum adiponectin level is independently associated with a low hemoglobin level and predicts the development of anemia in patients with CKD.

We evaluated extent and correlates of time in target, that is, the time spent with hemoglobin > or = 11 g/dl during the first year of epoetin and its association with renal survival. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected in 917 visits for 12.0 mo in 119 patients with chronic kidney disease; thereafter, patients started renal survival analysis for 10.1 mo. At baseline, hemoglobin was 10.0 +/- 0.8 g/dl and GFR was 22.1 +/- 14.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2. RESULTS: Hemoglobin target, reached in 1.5 mo, was steadily maintained in only 24% of patients. Time in target was not merely due to differences in time to target; after first achievement of target, in fact, a reduction of hemoglobin < 11 g/dl occurred in 51% of patients. At multivariate analysis, male gender, basal GFR and hemoglobin levels, first epoetin dose, and iron supplementation were directly associated with length of time in target. A lower risk for renal death (dialysis n = 53; death n = 8) was detected in the higher tertile of time in target (11.3 mo) versus lower tertile (3.2 mo). This difference persisted at Cox analysis after adjustment for age, gender, GFR, BP, and proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: In chronic kidney disease, time in target during the first year of epoetin therapy is frequently short depending not only on time to target but also on post-target hemoglobin reductions, correlates with male gender, timing, and intensity of initial therapy and is coupled with better renal survival.","2007","Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Instability of hemoglobin levels during epoetin therapy is a new problem in hemodialysis ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Results: After adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and PD duration, 20 g/L increment in hemoglobin (Hgb) was observed to significantly reduce the risk of inadequate PD by 19% (OR; 95% CI; P: 0.81; 0.70 to 0.95; 0.009), 5 g/L increment in the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) by 7% (0.93; 0.88 to 0.98; 0.009), and 5% increment in transferrin saturation (TS) by 23% (0.77; 0.64 to 0.94; 0.012). The gender-specific nomogram model was constructed by incorporating three significant anemia-related biomarkers and convenient influencing factors, and the prediction accuracy was good (concordance index (C-index): 0.686 for men and 0.825 for women). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the deterioration of three anemia-related biomarkers (Hgb, MCHC, and TS) can precipitate the development of inadequate PD in Chinese patients with CKD.","2023","Frontiers in physiology"," Objectives : The study aimed to examine the association of three anemia-related biomarkers with the adequacy of peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"22719216"," Profile of peginesatide and its potential for the treatment of anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis. ","Mikhail A.","Peginesatide is a synthetic, dimeric peptide that is covalently linked to polyethylene glycol (PEG). The amino acid sequence of peginesatide is unrelated to that of erythropoietin (EPO) and is not immunologically cross-reactive with EPO. Peginesatide binds to and activates the human EPO receptor, stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of human red cell precursors in vitro in a manner similar to other EPO-stimulating agents (ESAs). In Phase II and III studies in dialysis and predialysis patients, peginesatide administered once monthly was as effective as epoetin alfa given thrice weekly (dialysis patients) or darbepoetin given once weekly (nondialysis patients), in correcting anemia of chronic kidney disease as well as maintaining hemoglobin within the desired target range. In the dialysis population, the reported side-effect profile of peginesatide was comparable to that known with other marketed ESAs. In the nondialysis studies, compared with those treated with darbepoetin, patients treated with peginesatide experienced a higher adverse-effect profile. Peginesatide is likely to be licensed for treatment of renal anemia in dialysis patients and not in nondialysis patients. Despite this limitation, peginesatide is likely to prove valuable in treating dialysis patients because of its infrequent mode of administration, thereby allowing for a reduced number of injections, with associated better compliance, reduced cold storage requirement, and improved stock accountability. PEGylated therapeutic proteins can elicit immunological response to the PEG moiety of the therapeutic complex. Only long-term experience and post-marketing surveillance will address whether this immunological response will have any impact on the clinical efficacy or safety of peginesatide in clinical practice.","2012","Journal of blood medicine",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"36604823"," Step-Wise Management of Anemia in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care: Qualitative Study. ","Delanerolle G. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Anemia is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and reduced quality of life, but is often sub-optimally managed. Most patients are managed in primary care alongside other comorbidities. Interventions to improve the management of anemia in CKD in this setting are needed. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study to evaluate how an audit-based education (ABE) intervention might improve the management of anemia in CKD. We explored outcomes that would be relevant to practitioners and patients, that exposed variation of practice from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, and whether the intervention was feasible and acceptable. RESULTS: Practitioners (n = 5 groups) and patients (n = 7) from 4 London general practices participated in discussions. Practitioners welcomed the evidence-based step-wise intervention. However, prescribing erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) was felt to be outside of their scope of practice. There was a gap between NICE guidance and clinical practice in primary care. Iron studies were not well understood and anemia management was often conservative or delayed. Patients were often unaware of having CKD, and were more concerned about their other comorbidities, but largely trusted their GPs to manage them appropriately. CONCLUSIONS: The first steps of the intervention were welcomed by practitioners, but they expressed concerns about independently prescribing ESAs. Renal physicians and GPs could develop shared care protocols for ESA use in primary care. There is scope to improve awareness of renal anemia, and enhance knowledge of guideline recommendations; and our intervention should be modified accordingly.","2023","Journal of primary care & community health"," However , prescribing erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) was felt to be outside of their scope of practice ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

,"18846269"," Methoxypolyethylene glycol-epoetin beta for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. ","Del V. et al.","Therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is a well-established treatment for renal anemia. ESAs are highly effective at correcting the underlying anemia, restoring energy levels and increasing patient well-being and quality of life. Anemia correction has considerable secondary benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality reduction. However, because of the relatively short halflife of ESAs, they generally have to be administered one to three times weekly in most patients. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in recent years pharmacological research has tried to modify the molecular structure of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) in order to improve pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to allow a reduction in the frequency of administration. Covalent addition of the water-soluble polyethylene glycol moiety has been successfully used to improve the pharmacokinetics of a number of proteins and reduce their immunogenicity. A modified version of rHuEPO incorporating this large polymer chain, called continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator (CERA), has been recently synthesized. Data from animal studies indicate that CERA has a prolonged half-life in comparison with rHuEPO that may allow less frequent administration. Results of phase II and III clinical trials suggest that this agent is effective in maintaining hemoglobin levels after switching from rHuEPO therapy or darbepoetin alpha when administered up to once a month. This less frequent administration schedule may be an advantage for patients and healthcare providers. In addition, this agent may give increased hemoglobin stability over time.","2008","Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The Anemia CORrection in Diabetes (ACORD) Study aimed to investigate the effect of anemia correction on cardiac structure, function, and outcomes in patients with diabetes with anemia and early diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: One hundred seventy-two patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, mild to moderate anemia, and stage 1 to 3 chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to attain a target hemoglobin (Hb) level of either 13 to 15 g/dL (130 to 150 g/L; group 1) or 10.5 to 11.5 g/dL (105 to 115 g/L; group 2). The primary end point was change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Secondary end points included echocardiographic variables, renal function, quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Median Hb level and LVMI were similar in groups 1 and 2 (Hb, 11.9 and 11.7 g/dL [119 and 117 g/L]; LVMI, 113.5 and 112.3 g/m(2), respectively). At study end, Hb levels were 13.5 g/dL (135 g/L) in group 1 and 12.1 g/dL (121 g/L) in group 2 (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in median LVMI at month 15 between study groups (group 1, 112.3 g/m(2); group 2, 116.5 g/m(2)). Multivariate analysis showed a nonsignificant decrease in LVMI (P = 0.15) in group 1 versus group 2. Anemia correction had no effect on the rate of decrease in creatinine clearance, but resulted in significantly improved quality of life in group 1 (P = 0.04). There were no clinically relevant differences in adverse events between study groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with diabetes with mild to moderate anemia and moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, correction to an Hb target level of 13 to 15 g/dL (130 to 150 g/L) does not decrease LVMI. However, normalization of Hb level prevented an additional increase in left ventricular hypertrophy, was safe, and improved quality of life.","2007","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation"," The Anemia CORrection in Diabetes ( ACORD ) Study aimed to investigate the effect of anemia correction on cardiac structure , function , and outcomes in patients with diabetes with anemia and early diabetic nephropathy ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

However, it is entirely unknown about the impact of anemia on prognosis in HFpEF patients with CKD. In this study, we investigated the impact of anemia on prognosis and the optimal hemoglobin (Hb) levels to predict prognosis in HFpEF patients with CKD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively examined 523 consecutive HFpEF patients enrolled in Japanese heart failure syndrome with preserved ejection fraction registry. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 mL /min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence rate of anemia was 78% in HFpEF patients with CKD by using the World Health Organization criteria. Kaplan-Meier analysis for all-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization demonstrated that anemic patients had poor prognosis compared with non-anemic patients in HFpEF patients with CKD, but not those without CKD. According to the degree of CKD, anemia affected prognosis in HFpEF patients with mild CKD (45 ≤ eGFR < 60), but not those with moderate to severe CKD (15 ≤ eGFR < 45). Additionally, multivariate analysis revealed that anemia and Hb levels were independent predictors of composite outcomes in HFpEF patients with mild CKD, but not those with moderate to severe CKD. Finally, survival classification and regression tree analysis showed that the optimal Hb levels to predict composite outcomes were 10.7 g/dL in those with mild CKD.

METHODS: This randomized, open-label trial enrolled patients with anemia of CKD not on dialysis. Patients were required to have a stable Hb level (> or = 11.0 g/dl) and to have been previously receiving epoetin alfa for two or more months. Patients were randomized to one of four subcutaneously administered epoetin alfa dosing regimens: 10,000 units (U) once weekly (QW), 20,000 U every two weeks (Q2W), 30,000 U every three weeks (Q3W) or 40,000 U every four weeks (Q4W). Dose reductions, but not escalations, were permitted. Patients received treatment for a total of 16 weeks. The primary endpoint for the trial was the mean final Hb measurements of the QW, Q2W, Q3W, and Q4W groups. The primary efficacy analyses were non-inferiority assessments of the mean final Hb measurements of the Q2W, Q3W, and Q4W groups, compared with the QW group. The primary efficacy analyses were performed using a modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population, defined as all patients meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria (or, if not satisfying all criteria, were granted an exemption at study entry), and who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication. A per-protocol population, based on all patients who met the MITT criteria and completed the entire study, was used to evaluate the robustness of the MITT results. Quality of life was assessed for all dosing groups throughout the study. Safety was based on all patients randomized who received at least one dose of study medication. RESULTS: A total of 519 patients were enrolled; 445 were included in the MITT population. The four treatment groups were comparable with respect to baseline characteristics. The primary etiologies of CKD were diabetes (45.7%) and hypertension (29.9%). The mean baseline Hb, serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate for all patients were 11.9 +/- 0.8 g/dl, 3.1 mg/dl, and 21.1 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The mean baseline transferrin saturation was 25.2% and the mean ferritin was 201.9 ng/ml for all patients. All groups had a mean final Hb of > 11.0 g/dl. The mean final Hb levels of the Q2W and Q4W groups were statistically non-inferior to the QW group. The results of the per-protocol analysis were consistent with the MITT results. In addition, 93.5%, 89.5%, 77.2%, and 76.0% of patients maintained a mean Hb > or = 11.0 g/dl throughout the course of the study in the QW, Q2W, Q3W, and Q4W groups, respectively. Quality of life was maintained or improved from baseline to final within each dosing group. There were no significant differences in the mean final quality of life scores between the QW group and the Q2W, Q3W, and Q4W groups. Among the 513 patients evaluated for safety, epoetin alfa was well tolerated with no differences in adverse events between groups. The incidence of thrombotic adverse events was low (2.5% of patients), as was mortality (1.4% of patients).

We calculated 1) cumulative incidence (risk) of anemia [hemoglobin <12/<13 g/dl in women/men] by CKD stage, and 2) adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of anemia using Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: We identified 55,940 distinct individuals with newly identified CKD stages 3-5 and no prevalent anemia [n=41,958 patients in stage 3a, n=17,875 in stage 3b, n=5182 in stage 4, and n=931 in stage 5].

We analyzed data from a middle-aged, community-based cohort to determine if CKD and anemia interacted to affect stroke risk. METHODS: Data on 13,716 participants in the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study were analyzed to assess the joint effect of CKD and anemia on risk of incident stroke during a 9-year follow-up period. CKD was defined as a creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels of <13 g/dL for men or <12 g/dL for women. RESULTS: Overall, CKD was associated with an increase in stroke risk after adjustment for other factors [hazard ratio HR) 1.81; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.02]. However, this association was modified substantially by anemia. In the presence of anemia, CKD was associated with a substantially higher risk of stroke compared to no CKD (HR 5.43; 95% CI 2.04 to 14.41). In contrast, when anemia was not present, CKD was associated with only a modest, nonsignificant elevation in stroke risk (HR 1.41; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.14).

However, HbA1c's reliability in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been questioned, with concerns including competition from another posttranslational protein modification, carbamylation, acting on the same amino groups as glycation, and anemia with reduced erythrocyte lifespans leading to altered glycation accumulation. We investigated whether carbamylation and anemia modify the impact of HbA1c on renal outcomes in patients with diabetes and CKD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 1,516 participants from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study with diabetes and CKD, Cox regression models were applied to evaluate the association between HbA1c and CKD progression (composite of end-stage kidney disease or 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), stratified by carbamylated albumin (C-Alb) quartiles and anemia. RESULTS: The mean eGFR was 38.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, mean HbA1c was 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and median C-Alb was 8.4 mmol/mol. HbA1c was lower in the higher C-Alb quartiles. During a median follow-up of 6.9 years, 763 participants experienced CKD progression. Overall, higher HbA1c was associated with an increased risk of CKD progression (adjusted hazard ratio 1.07 [95% CI 1.02-1.13]). However, using stratified analyses, HbA1c was no longer associated with CKD progression in the highest C-Alb quartile, but did show a monotonic increase in CKD progression risk across each lower C-Alb quartile (P-interaction = 0.022). Anemia also modified the association between HbA1c and CKD progression (P-interaction = 0.025).

At end of study (8 weeks), mean (SD) Hb levels were 10.5 (1.28) g/dL and 11.0 (1.13) g/dL in biosimilar EPO and originator EPO groups, respectively. The proportion of patients with Hb levels maintained within the target range (>10 g/dL) during 8 weeks randomization phase were 58.1% and 71.4% in biosimilar EPO and originator EPO, respectively (p=0.60; NS). There were no significant difference in epoetin dose between the 2 groups, and there was no drug-related adverse event in either group.

Only 43-66% of dialysis patients develop effective anti-HBs titers after vaccination. AIM: To evaluate the effect of recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) therapy and basal hemoglobin levels on the outcome of the immune response to four doses of IM 40 microg Engerix-B vaccination in hemodialysis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients before starting replacement therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and three patients were included in the study: 34 hemodialysis patients treated with rEPO (Group A), 36 predialytic patients who did not treated with rEPO (Group B) and 33 predialytic patients treated with rEPO (Group C). Plasma creatinine in predialytic patients was 2-7 mg/dL. All patients' HBsAg and anti-HBs antibodies were negative. Patients were immunized with IM 40 microg Engerix-B at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Anti-HBs titers were measured at 7th month. RESULTS: Eighty seven point one percent of patients from group C developed protective anti-HBs titers compared with 69.4% from group B and 44.1% from group A (p = 0.001). Patients from all groups with baseline hemoglobin levels above 11 gr/dL developed protective anti-HBs titers significantly more than patients with baseline hemoglobin levels below 11 gr/dL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Predialytic patients treated with rEPO and with hemoglobin levels higher than 11 gr/dL had significantly better immune response outcomes to Engerix-B vaccination.

","Shen Y. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia is one of the common complications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no systematic investigation on the prevalence of anemia in CKD patients and its relationship with the quality of life in China. METHODS: The data for this study comes from baseline data from the Chinese Chronic Kidney Disease Cohort Study (C-STRIDE), which recruited predialysis CKD patients in China. The kidney disease quality of life summary (KDQOL-TM) was used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Use linear regression model to estimate the relationship between hemoglobin level and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 2921 patients were included in this study. The adjusted prevalence of hemoglobin (Hb) less than 100 g/L was 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.9,11.4%), and showed an increased trend through reduced eGFR levels from 4.0% (95%CI:2.3,5.9%) in the 45-60 ml/min/1.73m(2) group to 23.4% (95%CI:20.5,26.2%) in the 15-29 ml/min/1.73m(2) group. The prevalence of anti-anemia treatment was 34.0% (95%CI: 28.7,39.3%) and it is shown by reducing eGFR levels from 15.8% (95%CI:0,36.7%) in the 45-60 ml/min/1.73m(2) group to 38.2% (95%CI: 30.7,45.2%) in the 15-29 ml/min/1.73m(2) group. All five dimensions of the KDQOL scores in patients with CKD decreased as hemoglobin declined. After multivariable adjustments,the degrees of decrease became somewhat blunted. For example, compared with hemoglobin of ≥130 g/L, regression coefficients in the hemoglobin of < 100 g/L were - 0.047(95%CI: - 0.049,-0.045) for Symptoms and Problems(S), - 0.047(95%CI: - 0.049,-0.044) for Effects of the Kidney Disease(E), - 0.207(95%CI: - 0.212,-0.203) for Burden of the Kidney Disease(B), - 0.112(95%CI: - 0.115,-0.109) for SF-12 Physical Functioning (PCS), - 0.295(95%CI: - 0.299, -0.292) for SF-12 Mental Functioning (MCS), respectively.

We aimed to demonstrate safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) low molecular weight iron dextran (LMWID) during treatment of anemic stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods. Efficacy data was obtained by retrospective chart review of 150 consecutively enrolled patients. Patients were assigned per protocol to oral or IV iron, with IV iron given to those with lower iron stores and/or hemoglobin. Iron and darbepoetin were administered to achieve and maintain hemoglobin at 10-12 g/dL. Efficacy endpoints were mean hemoglobin and change in iron indices approximately 30 and 60 days after enrollment. Safety data was obtained by retrospective review of reported adverse drug events (ADEs) following 1699 infusions of LMWID (0.5-1.0 g). Results. Mean hemoglobin, iron saturation, and ferritin increased significantly from baseline to 60 days in patients assigned to LMWID (hemoglobin: 11.3 versus 9.4 g/dL; iron saturation: 24% versus 12.9%; ferritin: 294.7 versus 134.7 ng/mL; all P values < 0.0001).

However, some studies have associated a high body mass index (BMI) with improved renal outcomes—this is referred to as the obesity paradox for renal outcomes, especially in relation to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Central obesity can explain the obesity paradox in all-cause mortality. However, whether obesity or central obesity is associated with renal outcomes (renal replacement therapy or a 50% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate) in patients with advanced CKD remains unclear. Our study included 3605 Asian patients with CKD stages 1−5 divided into six groups according to their BMI (between 15 and 35 kg/m2). Through linear regression, BMI was positively associated with hemoglobin and albumin at CKD stages 4 and 5. In the competing risk Cox regression model, a high BMI (27.5−35 kg/m2) was associated with renal outcomes at CKD stages 1−3, but not stages 4 and 5. A high BMI was associated with renal outcomes in patients with hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL, but not <11 g/dL. A high waist-to-hip ratio was not associated with renal outcomes. We conclude that the CKD stage and anemia may explain the obesity paradox in renal outcomes in patients with CKD.","2022","Journal of clinical medicine",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The Russian-language version of the KDQOL-SF(TM) questionnaire, validated in Russia, was used to assess the HRQOL of patients on hemodialysis. A total of 723 patients were interviewed. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were assessed in 442 patients based on outpatient records. To identify the relationship between Hb level and HRQOL scales, a correlation analysis was performed, as well as a HRQOL analysis in the three groups differing in hemoglobin levels (<100; 100-120 and >120 g/l). Statistical data processing was carried by SPSS.22 and using parametric and nonparametric statistical methods.

METHODS: DREAM-D was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled clinical study conducted across 38 centers in India. A total of 392 patients with clinical diagnosis of anemia due to CKD with dialysis need (Erythrocyte Stimulating Agent [ESA] naïve or prior ESA users) and with baseline hemoglobin levels of 8.0-11.0 g/dL (inclusive) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either desidustat oral tablets (thrice a week) or epoetin alfa subcutaneous injection for 24 weeks to maintain a hemoglobin level of 10-12 g/dL. The primary endpoint was to assess the change in the hemoglobin level between the desidustat and the epoetin alfa groups from the baseline to evaluation period week 16-24. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the number of patients with hemoglobin response. RESULTS: The least square mean (standard error) change in hemoglobin from the baseline to week 16-24 was 0.95 (0.09) g/dL in the desidustat group and 0.80 (0.09) g/dL in the epoetin alfa group (difference: 0.14 [0.14] g/dL; 95% confidence interval: -0.1304, 0.4202), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin.

METHODS: Non-dialysis outpatients with chronic kidney disease and renal anemia were eligible. Anemia was treated based on the clinical condition of each patient and targeted hemoglobin (Hb) levels. RESULTS: A total of 283 patients from 21 institutions were enrolled and followed up for a maximum of 3 years. A doubling of the serum creatinine level was observed in 89 patients, and renal replacement therapy was initiated in 57 patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that a lower mean Hb level (mHb) and receiving fewer frequency of ESA during the follow-up period were independent determinants of the composite renal outcome and overall mortality. During the follow-up period, the percentages of patients with mHb of 10-10.9 g/dL and ≥ 11 g/dL were increased. Similar trends were seen regardless of whether the patients were treated by nephrologists or non-nephrologists. The frequency of ESA treatment was increased among the patients treated by non-nephrologists; however, it was much lower than nephrologists.

SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD and iron-deficiency anemia at 30 US centers. INTERVENTION: Oral ferric maltol at 30mg or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks (2:1 randomization) followed by ferric maltol at 30mg twice daily for up to 36 weeks (all patients). OUTCOME: Change from baseline in hemoglobin (primary end point at week 16), ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron; safety. RESULTS: 167 patients were randomized (ferric maltol, n=111; placebo, n=56). At week 16, hemoglobin had increased significantly with ferric maltol versus placebo (least-squares mean difference: 0.5±0.2 [SE] g/dL; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P=0.01). Ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron increased with ferric maltol but declined with placebo (all P<0.05).

We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in iron-deficient ND-CKD patients. METHODS: This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for ≥12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators' discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received ≤1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the ≤1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012.

LI","Grzeszczak W. et al.","In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia develops gradually, which is primarily due to an inadequate synthesis of erythropoietin by the kidneys, as well as to iron disorders in the body, blood loss, shortened erythrocyte survival and inflammation. The currently accepted treatment employs iron, vitamin B12, folic acid supplementation and the use of erythropoiesis stimulants, which are administered only parenterally. Research is currently underway on the new erythropoiesis drugs that can be orally administered, i.e., hypoxia-inducible factor-propyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) inhibitors which temporarily block propyl hydroxylase [PHD] catalysis and promote a transient increase in the expression of genes regulated by HIF, including kidney and liver erythropoietin [EPO]. Roxadustat is the first oral drug in this class and a potent HIF-PHD inhibitor, exerted to treat anemia in patients with CKD. In phase 1, 2 and 3 studies with CKD-affected patients, roxadustat was more effective to stimulate erythropoiesis for anemia correction than previously used drugs. Roxadustat can be orally given, unlike other erythropoiesis drugs with parenteral administration only, which grants roxadustat a considerable advantage. Our paper presents the results of studies with roxadustat applied for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients with or without dialysis. We are currently not yet able to know the exact role of roxadustat in the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD, but time will tell.

,"16949469"," Anemia, renal transplantation, and the anemia paradox. ","Rigatto C.","Anemia is prevalent in renal transplant recipients (RTRs), as it is in all chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations. Mild anemia occurs in up to 40% of RTRs, and more severe anemia (110 g/L) occurs in about 9% to 22% of patients. As in CKD, impaired graft (renal) function is a major predictor of anemia identified in nearly all studies, suggesting a major role for erythropoietin deficiency. Chronic inflammation, malnutrition, iron deficiency, and medications (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mycophenolate, azathioprine, and sirolimus) are contributory factors seen in some, but not all, studies. Although pathophysiologic and observational data strongly support a causal association between low hemoglobin levels and cardiovascular outcomes in RTRs, no randomized controlled trial to date has been able to show a clear benefit of anemia treatment on cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in either RTR or other CKD populations. This important paradox has led some investigators to question the causal nature of the association between anemia and heart disease.

","Kawahara K. et al.","AIM: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are all effective for renal anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it was reported that the haemoglobin (Hb) concentration decreases to 8.4 g/dL during the initial phase of dialysis despite treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). This study compared Hb at the initiation of dialysis among patients treated with three different ESAs (rHuEPO, darbepoetin alfa [DA], and a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator [CERA]). METHODS: The subjects were 82 CKD patients who started dialysis at Kawashima Hospital between 1 January 2009 and 28 February 2015 and who received only one kind of ESA for at least 6 months before initiation of dialysis. Baseline characteristics and laboratory data at initiation of dialysis were compared among the three groups. Then changes of the Hb, ESA dose, and erythropoiesis resistance index were assessed over time during the 6 months before initiation of dialysis. Differences of Hb at the initiation of dialysis were also assessed. RESULTS: Among the 82 patients, 36 received rHuEPO, 13 received DA, and 33 received CERA. Baseline characteristics and laboratory data of the patients showed no significant differences among the three groups. The monthly Hb decreased gradually during the 6-month period before initiation of dialysis in all three groups. Hb was significantly higher in the CERA group than the rHuEPO group at the initiation of dialysis. CONCLUSION: Long-acting ESAs may be more useful for predialysis patients with CKD because they do not attend hospital frequently, unlike haemodialysis patients.","2015","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)"," AIM : Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) are all effective for renal anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

As a consequence, radiation-induced irreversible, progressively chronic onset hypopituitarism (RIH) commonly develops after radiation treatments and can result in variably impaired pituitary function, which is frequently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old male subject, previously having received radiotherapy for treatment of nasopharygeal carcinoma (NPCA) 16 years ago, appeared at OPD complaining about his failure in penile erection, loss of pubic hair, atrophy of external genitalia: testicles reduced to 2×1.5 cm; penile size shrunk to only 4 cm long. Characteristically, he showed extremely lowered human growth hormone, (HGH, 0.115 ng/mL), testosterone (<0.1 ng/mL), total thyroxine (tT4: 4.740 g/mL), free T4 (fT4, 0.410 ng/mL), cortisol (2.34 g/dL); lowered LH (1.37 mIU/mL) and estradiol (22 pg/mL); highly elevated TSH (7.12 IU/mL). As contrast, he had low end normal ACTH, FSH, total T3, free T3, and estriol; high end normal prolactin (11.71 ng/mL), distinctly implicating hypopituitarism-induced hypothyroidism and hypogonadism. serologically, he showed severely lowered Hb (10.6 g/dL), HCT (32.7%), MCV (77.6 fL), MCH (25.3 pg), MCHC (32.6 g/dL), and platelet count (139×103/L) with extraordinarily elevated RDW (18.2%), together with severely lowered ferritin (23.6 ng/mL) and serum iron levels; highly elevated total iron binding capacity (TIBC, 509 g/dL) and transferrin (363.4 mg/dL), suggesting microcytic anemia. Severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) (89 mL/mim/1.73 m2) pointed to CKD2. Hypocortisolemia with hyponatremia indicated secondary adrenal insufficiency. Replacement therapy using androgen, cortisol, and Ringer's solution has shown beneficial in improving life quality.

METHODS: The Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire-short form (KDQOL-SF, Rand Corporation, Santa Monica, CA) was used to measure kidney disease specific and overall QOL in a cohort of predialysis CKD patients (n=79) enrolled in the clinic from January 2003 to September 2004. Baseline measures were compared to previously published measurements. The influence of demographic and clinical characteristics on baseline QOL was explored. Changes in QOL were evaluated over time. RESULTS: Patients with CKD entering the clinic had lower overall QOL compared with estimates from the general U.S. population (physical composite 35.7 vs 48.4 and mental composite 46.0 vs 50.2, respectively). Clinic patients had better kidney disease-specific scores than patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESRD). General QOL scores were similar regardless of kidney disease severity, with the exception of physical functioning which was lowest for patients with end-stage disease. Hemoglobin was the only factor predictive of QOL. Over time, QOL improved among patients managed in the CKD clinic, with statistically significant improvements in sleep (change of 6.2+/-15.2; P<.05) and social function (change of 11.6+/-27.7; P<.05).

","Pedersen L. et al.","Erythropoietin, Epo, is a 30.4 kDa glycoprotein hormone produced primarily by the fetal liver and the adult kidney. Epo exerts its haematopoietic effects by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of erythrocytes with subsequent improved tissue oxygenation. Epo receptors are furthermore expressed in non-haematopoietic tissue and today, Epo is recognised as a cytokine with many pleiotropic effects. We hypothesize that hydrodynamic gene therapy with Epo can restore haemoglobin levels in anaemic transgenic mice and that this will attenuate the extracellular matrix accumulation in the kidneys. The experiment is conducted by hydrodynamic gene transfer of a plasmid encoding murine Epo in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses TGF-β1 locally in the kidneys. This model develops anaemia due to chronic kidney disease characterised by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, deposition of mesangial matrix and mild interstitial fibrosis. A group of age matched wildtype littermates are treated accordingly. After a single hydrodynamic administration of plasmid DNA containing murine EPO gene, sustained high haemoglobin levels are observed in both transgenic and wildtype mice from 7.5 ± 0.6 mmol/L to 9.4 ± 1.2 mmol/L and 10.7 ± 0.3 mmol/L to 15.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L, respectively. We did not observe any effects in the thickness of glomerular or tubular basement membrane, on the expression of different collagen types in the kidneys or in kidney function after prolonged treatment with Epo. Thus, Epo treatment in this model of chronic kidney disease normalises haemoglobin levels but has no effect on kidney fibrosis or function.","2015","PloS one",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Wang K. et al.","Given the limited efficacy and potential disadvantages of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in treating anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the development of better alternative therapies has become a priority. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) and its underlying mechanism in the treatment of renal anemia. In the present study, we found that ASP could enhance hypoxic induction of EPO in Hep3B cells, with a mechanism that involved the stabilization of HIF-2α protein. In parallel, ASP rescued the inhibition of EPO, induced by proinflammatory factor TNF-α through blocking GATA2 and NF-κB activation. In a rat model of adenine-induced anemia of CKD, oral administration of ASP corrected anemia and alleviated renal damage and inflammation. By increasing the accumulation of HIF-2α protein and reducing the expression of NF-κB and GATA2 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, ASP stimulated both renal and hepatic EPO production, and resulted in an elevation of serum EPO. The restoration of EPO production and EPOR mRNA expression with ASP treatment activated EPOR downstream JAK2/STAT5 and PI3K/Akt signaling, induced their target genes, such as Bcl-xL, Fam132b and Tfrc, and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells of CKD rats. Furthermore, we found that ASP suppressed hepatic hepcidin expression, mobilized iron from spleen and liver and increased serum iron. These findings demonstrate that ASP elicits anti-anemic action by restoring EPO production and improving iron availability in the setting of CKD in rats.","2018","Frontiers in pharmacology"," The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis polysaccharide ( ASP ) and its underlying mechanism in the treatment of renal anemia ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Ferumoxytol is a newer large molecular weight intravenous iron formulation that is a colloidal iron oxide nanoparticle suspension coated with polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethyl ether. Ferumoxytol has robust iron-carbohydrate complex stability with minimal dissociation or appearance of free iron in the serum, allowing the drug to be given in relatively large doses with a rapid rate of administration. Clinical trials have demonstrated the superior efficacy of ferumoxytol versus oral iron with minimal adverse effects. However, recent postmarketing data have demonstrated a risk of hypersensitivity that has prompted new changes to the product information mandated by the Food and Drug Administration.

","Regidor D. et al.","BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials in cancer patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and in CKD patients treated to haemoglobin (Hb) targets above the labeled range of 10-12 g/dL with ESAs raised safety concerns regarding ESA therapy. Subsequently, product labeling was revised including addition of a black-box warning and removal of many quality of life claims not supported by current standards, and there were changes in reimbursement and anaemia guidelines. The extent to which these events influenced ESA dosing and Hb levels in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis (CKD-NOD) is not known. METHODS: We used data collected in a series of cross-sectional surveys between March 2005 and July 2009. Patients with CKD-NOD were selected from a random sample of free-standing US nephrology clinics. Information on demographics, insurance information, laboratory data and ESA use was abstracted from medical records by site investigators. We evaluated ESA treatment (use and dosing) and Hb levels over time and used multivariate linear regression to assess changes in ESA doses and Hb levels over time adjusting for case-mix differences. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2009, 15 836 CKD-NOD patients were sampled. During this period, ESA use declined from 60 to 46%, and the mean dose declined from 176 to 136 mcg/month; the largest decline in use and in dose occurred beginning in 2007. Simultaneously, the mean (standard deviation) Hb level in ESA-treated patients declined from 11.5 (1.4) to 10.6 (1.2) g/dL, though the decline was most pronounced starting in 2007. As the mean Hb declined, the percent of treated patients with an Hb > 12 g/dL dropped from 27 to 12%, and the mean dose in this sub-population declined from 173 to 111 mcg/month. CONCLUSION: The emergence of safety concerns and the subsequent changes in product labeling, reimbursement and clinical practice guidelines all appear to have influenced physician dosing practices resulting in less frequent use of ESAs, lower ESA doses and lower achieved Hb levels in CKD-NOD patients.","2011","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Pan W. et al.","OBJECTIVE: Anemia has been reported as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, there are still few studies examining the relationship between specific hemoglobin (Hb) levels and renal prognosis and renal function decline simultaneously. Meanwhile, the possible non-linear relationship between Hb and CKD progression also deserves further exploration. On that account, our primary goal is to explore the link of Hb on renal prognosis and renal function decline in patients with CKD. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study, which consecutively and non-selectively collected 962 participants from the research of CKD-ROUTE in Japan from November 2010 to December 2011. We used the Cox proportional-hazards and linear regression models to evaluate the independent association between baseline Hb and renal prognosis (renal composite endpoint, initiation of dialysis during follow-up or 50% decline in eGFR from baseline) and renal function decline(annual eGFR decline), respectively. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with cubic spline functions model and smooth curve fitting (penalized spline method) were conducted to address Hb and CKD prognosis's non-linearity. At the same time, a generalized additive model (GAM) and smooth curve fitting (penalized spline method) was conducted to explore the exact shape of the curve between Hb and renal function decline. Additionally, we did a series of sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of the results. Moreover, we conducted subgroup analyses. RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 67.35 ± 13.56 years old, and 69.65% were male. The mean baseline Hb and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 12.06 ± 2.21 g/dL and 33.04 ± 18.01 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). The annual decline in eGFR was 2.09 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year. During a median follow-up time of 33.5 months, 252(26.2%) people experienced renal composite endpoint. After adjusting covariates, the results showed that Hb was negatively associated with renal composite endpoint (HR = 0.836, 95%CI: 0.770, 0.907) and renal function decline (β = -0.436, 95%CI: -0.778, -0.093). There was also a non-linear relationship between Hb and renal composite endpoint, and the inflection point of Hb was 8.6 g/dL. The effect sizes(HR) on the left and right sides of the inflection point were 1.257 (0.841, 1.878) and 0.789 (0.715, 0.870), respectively. And the sensitive analysis demonstrated the robustness of the results. Subgroup analysis showed that Hb was more strongly associated with the renal composite endpoint in non-hypertensive, SBP < 140 mmHg, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) < 0.5 g/gCr, and diuretic use patients. In contrast, the weaker association was probed in hypertensive and non-diuretic use patients and the patients with SBP ≥ 140 mmHg, and UPCR ≥ 0.5 g/gCr.

We induced three different models of CKD in mice and evaluated the development of anemia characteristics. Mice were subjected to unilateral ischemia-reperfusion or received repeated low doses of cisplatin or folic acid to induce nephropathy. Renal function, kidney injury and fibrotic markers were measured to confirm CKD. Moreover, serum hemoglobin, ferritin and erythropoietin were analyzed. Renal mRNA levels of HIF-2α, erythropoietin, hepcidin, GATA-2, and GATA-2 target genes were also determined. All three CKD models presented increased levels of creatinine, urea, and proteinuria. Renal up-regulation of NGAL, KIM-1, and TNF-α mRNA levels was observed. Moreover, the three CKD models developed fibrosis and presented increased fibrotic markers and α-SMA protein levels. CKD induced decreased hemoglobin and ferritin levels and increased erythropoietin levels in the serum. Renal tissue showed decreased erythropoietin and HIF-2α mRNA levels, while an increase in the iron metabolism regulator hepcidin was observed.

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing roxadustat with placebo or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in anemia patients with CKD with or without dialysis. Results: Eleven studies including 6,631 patients met the inclusion criteria. In non-dialysis-dependent (NDD-) and dialysis-dependent (DD-) CKD patients, the total adverse events were not significantly different between the roxadustat and control (placebo for NDD-CKD patients and ESA for DD-CKD patients) groups [relative risk (RR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00, 1.04, P = 0.08, and RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.91, 1.64, P = 0.18, respectively], and the trial sequential analysis (TSA) confirmed the result in the NDD-CKD groups. No significant differences in hyperkalemia and infection incidences were found between roxadustat and placebo in the DD-CKD groups. The pooled results showed that roxadustat significantly increased the hemoglobin response rate compared with placebo in the NDD-CKD group and had an effect similar to that of ESA in the DD-CKD group. However, iron metabolism parameters did not seem to be obviously optimized by roxadustat. Conclusion: Roxadustat can be safely used in CKD patients. Oral roxadustat was more effective than placebo as a therapy for anemia in NDD-CKD patients and non-inferior to ESA in correcting anemia in DD-CKD patients. However, additional clinical trials are still needed to further prove whether roxadustat can optimize iron metabolism.","2021","Frontiers in medicine",,"Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Study medication was titrated to maintain hemoglobin 9-10.5 g/dL (Cohort 1) or 10-11.5 g/dL (Cohort 2). Hemoglobin, iron metabolism markers and safety parameters were measured every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Mean hemoglobin levels at Week 24 were 10.2 g/dL (Cohort 1) and 10.9 g/dL (Cohort 2) in the daprodustat group and 10.7 g/dL (Cohort 1) and 11.0 g/dL (Cohort 2) in the control group. Participants had hemoglobin levels within the target range a median of 82% and 66% of the time between Weeks 12 and 24 in the daprodustat and control groups, respectively. The adverse event profile was consistent with clinical events in the CKD population. CONCLUSIONS: Daprodustat effectively maintained target hemoglobin over 24 weeks in CKD patients with anemia who were rhEPO naïve or had switched from existing rhEPO therapy.","2019","Clinical kidney journal",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Koyama A. et al.","AIMS: Among adults with diabetes in the United States, we evaluated anemia prevalence by CKD status as well as the role of CKD and anemia, as potential risk factors for all-cause mortality. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we included 6,718 adult participants with prevalent diabetes from the 2003-March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian population in the United States. Cox regression models evaluated the role of anemia and CKD, alone or combined, as predictors of all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Anemia prevalence among adults with diabetes and CKD was 20%. Having anemia or CKD alone, compared with having neither condition, was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (anemia: HR = 2.10 [1.49-2.96], CKD: HR = 2.24 [1.90-2.64]). Having both conditions conferred a greater potential risk (HR = 3.41 [2.75-4.23]). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-quarter of the adult US population with diabetes and CKD also has anemia. The presence of anemia, with or without CKD, is associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of death by compared with adults who have neither condition, suggesting that anemia may be a strong predictor of death among adults with diabetes.","2023","Diabetes research and clinical practice"," AIMS : Among adults with diabetes in the United States , we evaluated anemia prevalence by CKD status as well as the role of CKD and anemia , as potential risk factors for all-cause mortality ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Liu Y. et al.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of anemia and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: A total of 292 patients with CKD undergoing PCI admitted to Guangdong General Hospital from October 2010 to December 2012 were consecutively enrolled in this study. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <130 g/L in male and <120 g/L in female. All patients were divided into the following two groups by their preoperative hemoglobin: anemic group (n = 101) and non-anemic group (n = 191). The incidence of CIN and other major adverse cardiac events in hospital were evaluated. The correlation between CIN and anemia was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The incidence rates of CIN were 9.9% (29/292) in all subjects, 17.8% (18/101) in the anemic group and 5.8% (11/191) in the non-anemic group. Compared with the non-anemic group, more patients in the anemic group required renal replacement therapy and intra-aortic balloon pump therapy, mechanical ventilation and manifested as acute heart failure (4.0% vs 0.0%, P = 0.006; 9.9% vs 1.0%, P < 0.001; 3.0% vs 0.0%, P = 0.017; 5.9% vs 1.0%, P = 0.015; respectively).

METHODS: In a multicenter prospective observational study, Japanese NDCKD patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and renal anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) treated with epoetin beta pegol (C.E.R.A.) for the first time were divided into two groups by Hb level (< 11 g/dL or ≥ 11 g/dL) in Week 12 of C.E.R.A. treatment (Week 12 Hb). Renal outcome was defined as time until the first occurrence of one of the following: progression to renal replacement therapy, serum creatinine doubling, or eGFR falling below 6 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The effect of Week 12 Hb on the onset of renal events was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: In the landmark analysis which included 2851 patients, Kaplan-Meier renal survival rate was 37.57% in the < 11 g/dL group and was significantly higher (51.47%) in the ≥ 11 g/dL group (P < 0.0001).

","Darbà J. and Ascanio M.","BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that is associated with a decrease in the quality of life of patients and an increase in the risk of other clinical complications. Iron therapy represents one of the fundamentals of patients with CKD. Sucrosomial(®) oral iron allows Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) to be used in all patients who are intolerant to treatment by the oral route of administration, or who present with malabsorption of conventional oral iron preparations. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to assess the economic impact of the oral iron Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) for the management of iron deficiency in CKD patients in Spain. METHODS: A 4-year budget impact model was developed for the period 2017-2020 for CKD patients with iron deficiency who were candidates for intravenous iron due to a lack of response to oral iron, from the perspective of the Spanish healthcare system. Three subgroups of CKD patients were included in the analysis: predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and post-transplant. The intravenous iron formulations Ferinject(®), Venofer(®), and Feriv(®) were considered appropriate comparators to be used in the model. National data on the prevalence of CKD for the three subgroups of patients were obtained from the literature, and input data on drug utilization and outpatient hospitalizations associated with iron administration were obtained by consulting nephrologists. Nephrology experts were also asked about resources used during medical visits and monitoring tests. Based on the unit costs for each iron therapy and the resources used, the total treatment cost per patient associated with each product was obtained to estimate the global budget impact of increasing the use of Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®). RESULTS: The average annual budget savings due to an increase in Fisiogen Ferro Forte(®) and a decrease in intravenous iron have been estimated at €398,685, €180,937, and €195,842 over 4 years for the predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and post-transplant groups, respectively.

,"28118622"," Targeting Hypoxia-Inducible Factors for the Treatment of Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients. ","Locatelli F. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), has previously been attributed primarily to decreased production of erythropoietin. More recently, it has become apparent that the etiology of anemia involves several other factors, most notably dysfunctional iron metabolism, mediated via increased hepcidin activity and reduced clearance. Current management of anemia in patients with advanced CKD is based on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplementation, along with red blood cell transfusions when necessary; however, safety considerations associated with these therapies highlight the need to pursue alternative treatment options targeting other mechanisms such as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that act as central regulators of erythropoiesis by coordinating a series of graded hypoxic responses. SUMMARY: This review discusses the discovery of the HIF pathway and its regulation via HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes in the context of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. The rationale for targeting this pathway and the clinical development of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are reviewed, with a commentary on the potential implications of this class of agents in CKD anemia management. Key Messages: Pharmacologic activation of the HIF pathway results in a transient pseudo-hypoxic state that stimulates erythropoiesis in CKD patients with anemia. Results from clinical studies of a number of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are increasingly available and provide support for the continued evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of this novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of anemia in CKD.","2017","American journal of nephrology",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Chen is a medicinal herb used to treat blood disorders since ancient times, of which the steamed form exhibits the anti-anemia effect and acts with a ""blood-tonifying"" function according to the traditional use. However, its pharmacological effect and mechanism on alleviating renal anemia (RA) are still unclear. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aims to investigate the effect of steamed Panax notoginseng (SPN) to attenuate RA and its underlying mechanism based on the model of adenine-induced RA mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy mice were randomly divided into seven groups of ten: the control group, model group, the erythropoietin (EPO) group, the Fufang E'jiao Jiang (FEJ) group, the high-dose steamed PN (H-SPN) group, the middle-dose steamed PN (M-SPN) group, and the low-dose steamed PN (L-SPN) group. The adenine induction RA model was applied to assess the ""blood enriching"" function of SPN. The blood routine indexes, erythrocyte fragility, pathologic morphology of kidney tissue and the expression levels of related cytokines and proteins in the mice were detected after 3-week administration with SPN and positive drugs. RESULTS: Our study provided evidences that SPN could ameliorate RA. Compared with the control group, SPN could attenuate RA by significantly increasing the numbers of peripheral blood cells (p < 0.01), improving the erythrocyte fragility (p < 0.01), and restoring the expression of EPO mRNA in the kidneys and EPO receptor mRNA in bone marrow nucleated cells. The expression of TGF-β(1) mRNA was declined and the expression of HGF mRNA was significantly increased in a dose-dependent way after the treatment of SPN. Additionally, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax ratio in the kidneys were significantly increased. In contrast, there was a highly significant decrease in the expression of Bax (p < 0.01), following SPN treatment. CONCLUSION: SPN could alleviate RA by promoting the overall hematopoiesis and inhibiting the progress of renal injury in mice.","2022","Journal of ethnopharmacology"," AIMS OF THE STUDY : The study aims to investigate the effect of steamed Panax notoginseng ( SPN ) to attenuate RA and its underlying mechanism based on the model of adenine-induced RA mice ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Crude ACS events were documented in 18.8% and 10.8% patients (P = .001), and stroke events occurred in 22.5% and 18.3% patients (P = .14) in EPO and non-EPO groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that in CRAS patients, EPO use was associated with increased risk of mortality and a trend toward increased cardiovascular events. Therefore, clinicians considering EPO use in CRAS patients should assess whether any potential benefits outweigh the risks of use.","2014","Journal of cardiac failure",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Piccoli A. et al.","BACKGROUND: A variable inhibition of erythropoiesis has been reported in uremic patients with renal anemia receiving anti-renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) drugs (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor-antagonists). The time to development of renal anemia before dialysis is still unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study (1 to 15 years) on records of 327 out-patients (217 males, 110 females) without anemia and with chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 16 to 75 mL/min) was conducted to estimate the time to development of renal anemia (Hb < 11.5 g/dL in females and Hb < 12.5 g/dL in men), and the time to decrease of Hb by 1 and 2 g/dL or more, irrespective of anemia development. Two treatment groups were analyzed: 142 patients with, and 185 without anti-RAS drugs. RESULTS: Median survival time to development of anemia was 81 months, 59 months to the loss of Hb > 1 g/dL, and 94 months for the loss of Hb > 2 g/dL. Anemia developed significantly earlier in patients with initial Ccr < 40 mL/min and in those with initial Hb < 14 g/dL. In the multivariate analysis (Cox model), male gender, Ccr < 40 mL/min, and Hb < 14 g/dL, in increasing order of relative risk, significantly contributed to prediction of anemia development without any influence of the treatment with anti-RAS drugs. The same results were obtained considering survival to the loss of either Hb > 1 g/dL or Hb > 2 g/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Development of renal anemia in mild to severe chronic kidney disease is not influenced by treatment with anti-RAS drugs.","2005","Journal of nephrology",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Iguchi A. et al.","BACKGROUND: In patients with normophosphatemia with chronic kidney disease (CKD), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) increase urinary phosphate excretion while maintaining serum phosphate within the normal range. Recent reports have shown that, in this stage, phosphate binders do not decrease serum FGF23 and PTH levels. Iron deficiency promotes transcription of FGF23 and iron-supplementation for iron deficiency decreases serum FGF23 levels. We hypothesized that ferric citrate hydrate, an iron-based phosphate binder, will decrease serum FGF23 levels in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD with normophosphatemia and iron deficiency. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open-label interventional study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), (2) normophosphatemia, (3) iron deficiency. Patients were assigned to the following groups: ferric citrate hydrate (FCH)-group, sodium ferrous citrate (SFC)-group, and control-group. After 12 weeks of intervention, we evaluated serum FGF23 levels and CKD-mineral bone disorder markers. RESULTS: There were 17 patients in the FCH-group, 14 in the SFC-group, and 9 in the control-group. The serum ferritin levels increased in the FCH-group and SFC-group compared with baseline. Serum FGF23 levels were unchanged; the change in the FCH-group was from 52.91 RU/mL (42.48-72.91) to 40.00 RU/mL (30.30-58.13) (P = 0.1764). However, in the FCH-group, serum PTH levels significantly decreased compared with baseline, from 68.00 pg/mL (49.00-141.00) to 60.00 pg/mL (44.00-144.00) (P = 0.0101).

METHODS: This is a nested case-control study of 184 type-2 diabetic and 184 non-diabetic CKD patients from a prospectively assembled database of a Nephrology outpatient clinic, matched for gender, age and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin: Men: < 13 g/dL, women: < 12 g/dL and/or use of recombinant erythropoietin) was examined in comparison, in the total population and by CKD Stage. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with anemia. RESULTS: The total prevalence of anemia was higher in diabetics (47.8% vs 33.2%, P = 0.004). Accordingly, prevalence was higher in diabetics in CKD Stage 3 (53.5% vs 33.1%, P < 0.001) and particularly in Stage 3a (60.4% vs 26.4%, P < 0.001), whereas it was non-significantly higher in Stage 4 (61.3% vs 48.4%; P = 0.307).

,"30347874"," Protective Role of Histidine Supplementation Against Oxidative Stress Damage in the Management of Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease. LI","Vera-Aviles M. et al.","Anemia is a major health condition associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A key underlying cause of this disorder is iron deficiency. Although intravenous iron treatment can be beneficial in correcting CKD-associated anemia, surplus iron can be detrimental and cause complications. Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly by mitochondria, leads to tissue oxidation and damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Oxidative stress increase in CKD has been further implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification. Iron supplementation leads to the availability of excess free iron that is toxic and generates ROS that is linked, in turn, to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. Histidine is indispensable to uremic patients because of the tendency toward negative plasma histidine levels. Histidine-deficient diets predispose healthy subjects to anemia and accentuate anemia in chronic uremic patients. Histidine is essential in globin synthesis and erythropoiesis and has also been implicated in the enhancement of iron absorption from human diets. Studies have found that L-histidine exhibits antioxidant capabilities, such as scavenging free radicals and chelating divalent metal ions, hence the advocacy for its use in improving oxidative stress in CKD. The current review advances and discusses evidence for iron-induced toxicity in CKD and the mechanisms by which histidine exerts cytoprotective functions.","2018","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Del F. et al.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated to a higher stroke risk. Anemia is a common consequence of CKD, and is also a possible risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine if anemia and CKD are independent risk factors for mortality after stroke. METHODS: This historic cohort study was based on a stroke registry and included patients treated for a first clinical stroke in the stroke unit of one academic hospital over a three-year period. Mortality predictors comprised demographic characteristics, CKD, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), anemia and other stroke risk factors. GFR was estimated by means of the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Renal function was assessed according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI)-CKD classification in five groups. A value of hemoglobin < 120 g/L in women and < 130 g/L in men on admission defined anemia. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox models were used to describe and analyze one-year survival. RESULTS: Among 890 adult stroke patients, the mean (Standard Deviation) calculated GFR was 64.3 (17.8) ml/min/1.73 m2 and 17% had anemia. Eighty-two (10%) patients died during the first year after discharge. Among those, 50 (61%) had K/DOQI CKD stages 3 to 5 and 32 (39%) stages 1 or 2 (p < 0.001). Anemia was associated with an increased risk of death one year after discharge (p < 0.001). After adjustment for other factors, a higher hemoglobin level was independently associated with decreased mortality one year after discharge [hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.98 (0.97-1.00)]. CONCLUSIONS: Both CKD and anemia are frequent among stroke patients and are potential risk factors for decreased one-year survival. The inclusion of patients with a first-ever clinical stroke only and the determination of anemia based on one single measure, on admission, constitute limitations to the external validity. We should investigate if an early detection and management of both CKD and anemia could improve survival in stroke patients.","2010","BMC nephrology"," The purpose of this study was to examine if anemia and CKD are independent risk factors for mortality after stroke ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

We aimed at investigating the interactions between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), anemia, and physical performance on 1-year mortality in older patients discharged from acute care hospitals. METHODS: Four hundred and eighty seven patients enrolled in a multicenter, prospective observational study were included in the analysis. eGFR was estimated by the Berlin Initiative Study 1 equation. Anemia was defined on the basis of hemoglobin values. Mobility limitation was rated by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Covariates included demographics, nutritional status, cognitive performance, and comorbidity. The outcome of the study was mortality over 1-year follow-up. Interactions among study variables were investigated by survival tree analysis. RESULTS: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), anemia, and SPPB = 0-4 were significantly associated with mortality, as were hypoalbuminemia and cognitive impairment. Survival tree analysis showed that compared to patients with SPPB ≥ 4 and eGFR ≥ 46.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (ie, patients with the least mortality), patients with SPPB < 4 and hemoglobin < 12.2 g/dL had the highest risk of mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 28.9, 95%CI 10.3-81.2]. Patients with SPPB ≥ 4 and eGFR < 46.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and those with SPPB > 4, hemoglobin ≥ 12.2g/dL, and eGFR ≥ 58.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) had intermediate risk (HR = 6.58, 95%CI = 2.15-20.2, and HR = 15.11, 95%CI=4.42-51.7, respectively).

Roxadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, stimulates erythropoiesis by increasing endogenous erythropoietin and iron availability. METHODS: In this open-label phase 3 study, patients with DD-CKD and anemia were randomized 1:1 to oral roxadustat three times weekly or parenteral epoetin alfa per local clinic practice. Initial roxadustat dose depended on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose at screening for patients already on them and was weight-based for those not on them. The primary efficacy end point was mean hemoglobin change from baseline averaged over weeks 28‒52 for roxadustat versus epoetin alfa, regardless of rescue therapy use, tested for noninferiority (margin, -0.75 g/dl). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 2133 patients randomized (n=1068 roxadustat, n=1065 epoetin alfa), mean age was 54.0 years, and 89.1% and 10.8% were on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, respectively.

","Wish J. and Coyne D.","Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is characterized by a glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (reference range, 90-200 mL/min/1.73m2 for a 20-year-old, with a decrease of 4 mL/min per decade), affects approximately 8 million people in the United States. Anemia is common in patients with stage 3 CKD and, if not corrected, contributes to a poor quality of life. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), introduced almost 2 decades ago, have replaced transfusions as first-line therapy for anemia. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of ESAs in the primary care of patients with anemia of CKD and discusses pharmacological and pharmacoeconomic issues raised by recent data. Relevant studies in the English language were identified by searching the MEDLINE database (1987-2006). Two ESAs are currently available in the United States, epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa. More frequent dosing with epoetin alfa is recommended by the labeled administration guidelines because it has a shorter half-life than darbepoetin alfa. Clinical experience also supports extended dosing intervals for both these ESAs. Use of ESAs in the management of anemia of CKD is associated with improved quality of life, increased survival, and decreased progression of renal failure. Some evidence suggests that ESAs have a cardioprotective effect. However, correction of anemia to hemoglobin levels greater than 12 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10) appears to increase the risk of adverse cardiac outcomes and progression of kidney disease in some patients. The prescription of ESAs in the primary care setting requires an understanding of the accepted use of these agents, the associated pharmacoeconomic challenges, and the potential risks. This review considers the need to balance effective ESA dosing intervals against the potential risks of treatment.","2007","Mayo Clinic proceedings",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Toto R. et al.","AIM: This multicenter, open-label study determined safety and efficacy of once-every-other-week administration of darbepoetin alfa for anemia of chronic kidney disease in erythropoietin-naive patients not on dialysis. METHODS: Participants with hemoglobin levels <11.0 g/dl at baseline were administered darbepoetin alfa at an initial dosage of 0.75 microg/kg once every other week. The dose was titrated to achieve and maintain a hemoglobin response, defined as a hemoglobin range of between 11.0 and 13.0 g/dl for up to 24 weeks. The primary end point was the dose of darbepoetin alfa at initial hemoglobin response. RESULTS: Six hundred and eight patients were enrolled, and 463 completed the study; 95% (95% confidence interval: 0.93, 0.97) of the patients who completed treatment achieved a hemoglobin response. The mean darbepoetin alfa dose at the time of response was 63.5 +/- (SD) 16.9 microg, and the mean time to hemoglobin response was 5.7 +/- (SD) 4.5 weeks.

Studies of correction of the anemia with intravenous (IV) iron in both CKD and CHF have shown an improvement in the anemia and, in some cases, in the renal function as well. Some CHF studies of correction of the iron deficiency have shown an improvement in cardiac function and structure as well as in exercise capacity and quality of life. This occurred independent of whether or not they had anemia, suggesting that the iron deficiency itself may be independently contributing to the worsening of the CHF and CKD. If future long-term studies confirm the safety and efficacy of IV iron in the treatment of iron deficiency in CKD and CHF, this will become a new addition to the therapeutic armamentarium of the cardiorenal syndrome, and parameters of iron deficiency will become part of the routine measurements performed in both CKD and CHF whether or not the patient is anemic.","2011","International journal of nephrology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

We investigated the demographics and clinical findings of 231 cancer patients (male : 142, female : 89) who were admitted to the Division of Chemotherapy at the Cancer and Infectious Disease Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital between April and September, 2008. Mean age was 63.6 +/- 12.7 years. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb)level less than 12 g/dL and the anemia severity grades were classified according to the Anemia Toxicity Scales. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated based on the formula of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease modified for the Japanese. CKD was defined as stage 3 or more according to the K/DOQI criteria. To assess the clinical relevance of anemia and CKD to 1-year survival, we drew Kaplan-Meier curves, stratifying patients according to the anemia severity grades and the presence or absence of CKD. The joint impact of anemia grades and presence of CKD on 1-year mortality was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis, adjusted for age and gender. Prevalence of anemia was 81% : 6.9% for grade 4 (Hb < 6.5 g/dL); 13.9% for grade 3(6.5 = Hb < 8.0 g/dL); 29.0% for grade 2 (8.0 = Hb < 10.0 g/dL); 31.2% for grade I (10.0 = Hb < 12.0 g/dL) and 19.0% for non-anemia cases. Prevalence of CKD was 25%. Survival probability of the overall or non-CKD cancer patients with anemia severity > or = grade 2 significantly decreased, as compared to that with no anemia. Survival probability of patients with CKD significantly decreased, as compared to that with no CKD. Statistically, the hazard ratio of mortality for patients with both grade 4-anemia and CKD was 14-fold higher than that for patients with neither anemia nor CKD.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine anemia management patterns of CKD in outpatient settings in the United States. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the US National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) from 1996 to 2002. Patients aged 18 years with CKD were included in the study sample. Office visits were considered CKD-related if relevant International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes were recorded and if CKD was reported as a reason for the visit. Similarly, visits were considered anemia related if relevant ICD-9-CM codes were recorded and if anemia was reported as a reason for the visit or if anemia-related laboratory testing (eg, hematocrit) was ordered. Anemia medications (ie, erythropoietic-stimulating agents or iron replacement) were retrieved using the NDC drug codes. All analyses were statistically weighted using the NAMCS sampling weights to make national estimates. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2003, there were 2234 unweighted CKD-related patient visits in the outpatient setting, representing approximately 92 million weighted outpatient visits. The majority of these visits were made by women (63%) and patients aged > or =65 years (54%). Of these visits, 18% were to a nephrologist. Anemia-management issues were also recorded at nearly half (48%) of all CKD outpatient visits. Ten percent of visits for anemia management resulted in an anemia medication prescription. Patients on Medicare (odds ratio [OR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.74) were less likely and those assessed previously (OR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.66-10.88) were more likely to receive an anemia medication prescription. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that approximately 10% of CKD-related visits addressing anemia management are receiving anemia medications in US out-patient settings. Most CKD-patient visits were to primary care physicians (PCPs) and physicians other than nephrologists.

Handgrip strength (HGS) and blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration are two parameters considered representative of nutritional status but not included among the criteria for PEW diagnosis. In the present work we investigated whether they could help identifying CKD patients at risk of undernutrition. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a two-step cluster analysis to classify a cohort of 71 stage 3-5 CKD patients, none of which with PEW, according to their Hb concentration and dominant-hand HGS. Two clusters were finely separated using this method. When we compared the two groups for main body composition and nutritional variables by using t-test statistics or Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate, we found significant differences in PhA, ECW/TBW, ASMI, serum iron. Then we stratified our population by gender and performed cluster analysis as well. PhA, ECW/TBW were still significantly different in the two clusters both in M and in F, while serum iron concentration only in males and ASMI only in females. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that either in male than in female Hb concentration and HGS may distinguish two subgroups of CKD patients with different nutritional status and disease severity.

Parathyroidectomy (PTX) is recommended for severe SHPT patients. Here, the associations between circulating leptin and clinical characteristics in CKD patients were investigated. Effects of PTX on leptin production were analyzed in vivo and in vitro. Controls and CKD patients had approximate serum leptin levels in that a larger proportion of CKD patients with body mass index (BMI) <23 kg/m(2). Serum leptin was related to anemia, albumin, and bone metabolism disorders in CKD patients. Lower intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was related with higher leptin in PTX patients group. Severe SHPT inhibited uremia-enhanced leptin production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which was attenuated after PTX. High levels of PTH were found to reduce Akt phosphorylation and leptin production in vitro but high levels of calcium and phosphorus were not. Successful PTX was found to improve anemia and malnutrition in severe SHPT patients, and this was correlated with increased circulating leptin levels via up-regulated Akt signaling in adipocytes.

Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis aiming at investigating its efficacy and safety on the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related anemia. Methods: We systematically searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Clinical Trial Registries databases from inception until December 2021. We selected randomized controlled trials comparing daprodustat with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in anemia patients with CKD with or without dialysis. Results: Seven studies including 7933 patients met the inclusion criteria. For both nondialysis-dependent (NDD-) CKD and dialysis-dependent (DD-) CKD patients, the pooled results showed that there was no significant difference in the changes in hemoglobin levels between the daprodustat and rhEPO groups (mean difference (MD) = -0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.38, 0.35, p = 0.95; MD = 0.15, 95% CI = -0.29, 0.60, p = 0.50; respectively). In addition, a significant increase in transferrin saturation (TSAT), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and total iron was observed in daprodustat groups compared with rhEPO groups in DD-CKD patients (p < 0.05). As for safety, the overall frequency of adverse events was similar between the daprodustat and rhEPO groups in DD-CKD patients (relative risk (RR) = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.92, 1.06, p = 0.76), and the trial sequential analysis (TSA) confirmed this result. But for NDD-CKD patients, the incidence of adverse events in the daprodustat groups was significantly higher than that of rhEPO groups (RR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.01,1.07, p = 0.02), while the TSA corrected this result. No trend of increasing incidence of serious adverse events was found in all daprodustat treated patients, but the TSA could not confirm this result. Conclusion: Although daprodustat was noninferior to rhEPO in correcting anemia in both NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients, it seemed to have a better effect on optimizing iron metabolism in DD-CKD patients. Daprodustat may be a promising alternative for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD.

Gender differences have been identified in many of these areas as well as, and importantly, in cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease outcomes. Female gender is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as slower progression of chronic kidney disease. Interestingly, there are some well-described physiological adaptations to anaemia in women, which include shifting of the haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve to reduce oxygen affinity secondary to higher levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. However, the complex physiology underlying the impact of anaemia or gender on patients with chronic kidney disease is not well-characterized to date. Furthermore, there has been little examination of the potential interaction between anaemia and gender on cardiac or kidney outcomes.

RESULTS: The subjects consist of CKD patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who present renal anemia. The target number of registered cases is 2000 patients, based on estimates of incidences of renal and CVD events from past studies. Renal function and CVD events will be observed for 96 weeks after the initiation of darbepoetin alfa administration. Definitions of ESA hyporesponsiveness will also be investigated. CONCLUSION: By clarifying markers and factors involved in ESA hyporesponsiveness and their relationships with renal and CVD events, this ongoing study aims to improve evidence-based therapies for renal anemia in non-dialysis CKD patients.","2018","Clinical and experimental nephrology"," The primary objective is to survey the current realities of the therapy with ESA in Japan and evaluate the correlation between hyporesponsiveness to darbepoetin alfa and CKD progression ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"17022852"," Relationship between hemoglobin level and quality of life in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease receiving epoetin alfa. ","Lefebvre P. et al.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between hemoglobin (Hb) level and quality of life (QOL) in anemic patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease receiving epoetin alfa. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A post-hoc analysis using data from a multicenter, open-label, prospective study of epoetin alfa for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis was conducted. The relationship between Hb and QOL was analyzed using correlation and longitudinal analyses, the latter adjusting for sample selection bias. The Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) and the Kidney Disease Questionnaire (KDQ) subscales were used to measure QOL. The impact of an incremental 1 g/dL increase in Hb level on LASA and KDQ scores was determined using an incremental analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1183 and 1044 patients formed the study populations for the LASA and KDQ analyses, respectively. There was a positive and significant relationship between Hb levels and QOL (p < 0.05). Using non-linear regression analysis, we characterized the sigmoid-shape of the relationship between Hb levels and QOL scores. Hemoglobin change was a statistically significant determinant of QOL improvement for both LASA and KDQ scales (p < 0.05). The model predicted that, based on a 2 unit change in Hb, the greatest incremental QOL improvement per unit of Hb increase occurred when Hb was in the range of 11 to 12 g/dL. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, beyond the well-known relationship between Hb increases and QOL improvements, the maximal incremental gain in QOL occurred when Hb reached 11 to 12 g/dL. This suggests that treating anemic patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease until their Hb level reaches 12 g/dL will result in the greatest QOL improvement per Hb unit increase. The analyses were conducted based on an open-label study of epoetin alfa and could be further validated using a randomized, controlled trial, comparing incremental gains in QOL associated with treatment initiation at varying levels of Hb across arms.","2006","Current medical research and opinion"," OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the relationship between hemoglobin ( Hb ) level and quality of life ( QOL ) in anemic patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease receiving epoetin alfa ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

We conducted a retrospective study to assess the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on hemoglobin levels in Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD. METHODS: Diabetic patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), who filled a prescription for an ACEI or ARB, were included. Changes in hemoglobin levels after initiating treatment with an ACEI or ARB were compared using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and propensity-score matching to minimize the bias. RESULTS: A total of 201 diabetic patients, 77 treated with an ACEI and 124 treated with an ARB, fulfilled study criteria and constituted the retrospective cohort. Mean (+/-s.e.) change in hemoglobin (adjusted for covariates) was greater for patients treated with ARBs (-0.43 +/- 0.08 g/dl) than patients treated with ACEIs (-0.11 +/- 0.11 g/dl, P = 0.025) by ANCOVA. In the propensity-score cohort analysis of 57 pairs of ACEI/ARB-treated patients, a significant decrease in hemoglobin was observed in patients treated with an ARBs (-0.54 +/- 1.02 g/dl (mean +/- s.d.), P < 0.001), but not in patients treated with an ACEIs (-0.14 +/- 0.98 g/dl, P = 0.294).

METHODS: The results of these studies are reviewed with respect to differences in study populations, study design and methodological limitations to provide guidance for their interpretation and relevance for clinical practice. RESULTS: There are important differences with respect to enrolled populations, design and conduct of the studies. Each study has its specific, inherent methodological limitations. Importantly, there is no statistically significant and consistent pattern of negative results for cardiovascular and mortality outcomes, although in general outcomes are not in favor of hemoglobin normalization. On the other hand, the reported data on quality of life are consistently and significantly better with higher hemoglobin values. CONCLUSIONS: Recent evidence from large outcome studies suggested an increased risk associated with hemoglobin normalization. On the other side, several study-inherent and methodological limitations must be considered before simply extrapolating the negative findings of these studies into clinical practice.

This longitudinal study aimed at ascertaining the association between hepcidin-25 levels and the progression of renal anemia. METHODS: We selected 335 non-dialysis CKD patients who showed hemoglobin concentrations >10 g/dL and who were not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy, from among the subjects of our previous study, who had been recruited between February and June 2007 in a previous study. The primary outcome was the start of the ESA therapy or hemoglobin concentrations remaining below 10 g/dL for >3 months, by 31 December 2010. The patients were classified into high- and low-ferritin groups depending on their median ferritin levels. The Cox proportional hazard model with restricted cubic spline curve analysis was used to determine the association between hepcidin-25 levels and the outcome for each group. RESULTS: The hepcidin-25 level was a significant predictor both for the high-ferritin group (P = 0.04, linearity = 0.02) and for the low-ferritin group (P = 0.04, linearity P = 0.02). The spline curve for the high-ferritin group showed that higher hepcidin-25 levels had a high log-relative hazard.

This study evaluated if there was a clinical impact of this statement in the anemia management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients treated with ESAs not on dialysis in routine clinical practice in Spain. METHODS: This was an observational and cross-sectional study carried out in CKD patients not on dialysis in Spain who initiated ESA treatment (naïve), or were shifted from a previous ESA to another ESAs (converted) since January 2011. RESULTS: Of 441 patients evaluated, 67.6% were naïve and 32.4% were converted. At the study visit, 42.5% of naïve patients achieved the Hb target of 11-12 g/dL, with a mean Hb of 11.3±1.3 g/dL (vs 10.1±0.9 g/dL at the start of ESA therapy). Only 35.3% of converted patients maintained Hb levels within the recommended target at the study visit. Yet, 8.2% of naïve patients and 7.9% of those converted had Hb levels >13 g/dL. Hb levels were similar across subgroups of patients, regardless of the presence of significant comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia management in CKD patients treated with ESAs by Spanish nephrologists seems to be aimed at preventing Hb levels <11 g/dL, while <50% of patients were within the narrow recommended Hb target range. This, together with the lack of individualization in Hb targets according to patients' comorbidities show that there is still room for improvement in renal anemia management in the clinical setting.","2015","Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : The Anemia Working Group of ERBP in 2010 recommended a target hemoglobin ( Hb ) level in the range of 11-12 g / dL , without intentionally exceeding 13 g / dL during the treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Sugahara M. et al.","Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and is mainly caused by the inability of injured kidneys to produce adequate amounts of erythropoietin. Studies elucidating the regulation of erythropoietin production led to the identification of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which activates the transcription of genes that mediate adaptive responses to hypoxia. HIF is a heterodimer that consists of an α and β subunit. While HIF-β is constitutively expressed, HIF-α is subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. This process is mediated by prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins, the inhibition of which results in an increased expression of hypoxia-induced genes, including erythropoietin. These findings led to the development of prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against anemia in chronic kidney disease. Prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibition improves iron metabolism, which also contributes to erythropoiesis. To date, at least 6 small-molecule inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylase domain have been tested in humans, and clinical trials have shown that they are effective without causing serious adverse events. However, there is a theoretical concern that the systemic activation of HIF could also induce deleterious effects such as tumorigenesis and severe pulmonary hypertension, which demands careful assessments in future clinical studies.","2017","Kidney international",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed for 6 months before and after switching ESAs. The prevalence of adverse events, the dose conversion ratio of ESAs, and the frequency of ESA administration were also analyzed. RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed that switching ESAs did not significantly change hemoglobin levels for the study duration in both groups (mean hemoglobin 10.3-10.5 g/dL in Group 1 and 10.4-10.7 g/dL in Group 2). Estimated glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, transferrin saturation, ferritin, and albumin remained constant in both groups.

","Wish J.","The management of anemia in the United States during the past 2 decades and since the introduction of erythropoietin (EPO) has continuously evolved, shaped by the interplay of reimbursement, evidence, clinical performance measurement, and, most recently, risk management. A fee-for-service reimbursement system has driven average EPO doses higher than anywhere else in the world, despite opportunities to decrease such dosing through more effective iron management and subcutaneous administration. Calls by Congress for Medicare to constrain ESA costs and FDA relabeling of erythropoietic-stimulating agents (ESAs), in the wake of The Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency and The Cardiovascular risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta trials, have in 2007 led to the first decrease in mean hemoglobin levels in US hemodialysis patients since EPO was introduced in 1989. The implementation of a case-mixed adjusted bundled payment system for ESRD services in 2011 will turn ESAs from a profit center to a cost center for dialysis providers. This is likely to have profound implications regarding anemia management directed at curtailing ESA dosing, including subcutaneous administration, more aggressive iron therapy, and decreased target hemoglobin levels. Medicare has developed a third generation of clinical performance measures (CPMs) for ESRD providers (facilities and physicians) to ensure that quality is maintained in the new fiscal environment. Unlike the previous generations, these new CPMs emphasize an upper limit of hemoglobin as well as a lower one. Payment for performance based on these CPMs will likely be a key driver of future practice patterns for anemia management.","2009","Advances in chronic kidney disease",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The SF-36 domains and Component Summary scores (p < 0.05-p < 0.0001) demonstrated ability to detect change. For the FACT-An, significant differences (p < 0.05-p < 0.0001) were observed between responder and non-responder change scores: important change score estimates ranged from 2 to 4 for Vitality and 2-3 for Physical functioning. Important change scores were also estimated for the FACT-An Total score (6-9), the Anemia (3-5), and Fatigue subscale (2-4). CONCLUSIONS: Both the SF-36 Vitality and Physical function scales and the FACT-An Total, Fatigue and Anemia scales, are reliable and valid measures for assessing health-related quality of life in anemia associated with CKD.","2018","Health and quality of life outcomes",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Baylis C.","BACKGROUND: The goal was to determine whether administration of the oxygen-therapeutic blood substitute HBOC-201 had any deleterious effect on renal function and/or structure in a rat model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Longitudinal studies were conducted in the conscious chronically catheterized male Sprague-Dawley rat with rapidly progressing CKD produced by ablation-infarction of 5/6th of the functional renal mass. Experimental rats received a loading dose (after acute removal of 10% blood volume) and six subsequent daily maintenance doses of HBOC-201 at Weeks 4 to 5 after induction of CKD and were studied again at 6 weeks. Controls received isoosmotic human serum albumin (HSA, 13%) over the same period. Blood pressure (BP) and renal function were measured in acute experiments at Weeks 4, 5, and 6. Proteinuria and 24-hour creatinine clearance was measured longitudinally and renal pathology was assessed at killing. RESULTS: There were differences in the acute response to the infusions, with rats given HBOC-201 exhibiting an increase in BP and renal vascular resistance, whereas rats given HSA showed a decrease in BP. These changes did not persist, however, because mean BP, glomerular filtration rate, level of proteinuria, and glomerular pathology were all similar at the end of the study (6 weeks after induction of CKD) in rats given HBOC-201 and HSA. CONCLUSION: In this model of CKD, daily doses of HBOC-201 had no long-term damaging effects on renal function or structure, compared to rats given the osmotic control agent, 13 percent HSA.","2006","Transfusion",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

However, the prognostic impact of both CKD and anemia on clinical outcomes, when they coexist, remains unclear in CAD patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We studied 2484 CAD patients who underwent their first PCI and had available date on preprocedural hemoglobin between 2000 and 2016. The patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of CKD and/or anemia. We evaluated the incidences of all-cause death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Among the patients, 310 patients (12.5%) had both CKD and anemia (CKD with anemia group), 309 (12.4%) had CKD only, 461(18.6%) had anemia only, and 1404 (56.5%) had neither CKD nor anemia. Patients in the CKD with anemia group were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. During a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients in the CKD with anemia group had significantly higher incidences of MACCE and all-cause death than the CKD only and anemia only group (both log-rank p < 0.001). Using patients with the no CKD or anemia group as a reference, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence interval for MACCE were 1.51 (0.92-2.47) for the CKD only, 1.48 (0.94-2.32) for the anemia only and 2.00 (1.18-3.38) for the CKD with anemia group.

","Levin A.","The increasing awareness of the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the dialysis population has led clinical nephrologists and researchers to focus their attention on processes and factors that are present in patients prior to dialysis. It is clear that many of the risk factors for kidney disease and cardiovascular disease are similar: This may account for the high prevalence of CVD within the dialysis population. However, it is evident that there are unique risk factors for CVD that are present in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These unique uremia-related risk factors for CVD include anemia, hyperparathyroidism, abnormalities of mineral metabolism, and acidosis. Of note, the association of anemia, or lower levels of hemoglobin, have been consistently described in all populations with kidney disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy has long been known as an independent risk factor for death and CV events, in both the dialysis and general populations. There have been accumulating data that LVH and left ventricular (LV) growth occur prior to dialysis in patients with kidney disease, and that the prevalence of LVH in that group of patients is caused by, conventional risk factors for LVH (e.g., hypertension) as well as nonconventional risk factors such as anemia.","2002","Kidney international.

In order to assess this strategy in clinical practice, we constituted a cohort of patients within our nephrology department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had CKD stages 3 to 5, hemoglobin level (Hb)<13g/dL (men) or<12g/dL (women), and ferritin level (F)<100ng/mL or transferrin saturation (TSAT)<20%. They were not treated by erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) for at least one month, and oral iron had been poorly tolerated or ineffective. FCM first dose was adjusted according to patient weight. A new infusion was possible, at least one month after the first, with a half-dose if TSAT<20% but F≥200ng/mL; no perfusion was performed if F≥400ng/mL. RESULTS: In all, 53 patients were included with a mean Hb of 11.4g/dL and a mean TSAT of 16%. Over one year of follow-up, only 12 patients (22.6%) needed another treatment for anemia (blood transfusion or ESA). No patient showed a significant decrease in Hb. In all, 62% of patients received only one infusion of FCM. CONCLUSION: The administration of FCM IV with ferritin levels in the recommended target has proven effective in correcting anemia of ND-CKD patients while limiting the use of another therapeutic strategy.","2019","Nephrologie & therapeutique",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Fatima K. et al.","PURPOSE: Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has traditionally been treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). Recently, daprodustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor, has also been shown to increase hematocrit. It remains unclear whether daprodustat or rhEPO should be the treatment of choice for anemia of CKD. We aimed to assess the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of daprodustat versus rhEPO in CKD patients. METHODS: Online databases were queried in April 2022 for articles comparing the efficacy and safety of daprodustat in DD-CKD and NDD-CKD subgroups. Results from trials were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Data on 8245 CKD patients from eight clinical trials were included. Our results show that in comparison to rhEPO, daprodustat maintained the same efficacy in increasing hemoglobin levels in both the DD-CKD (MD: 0.10; 95% CI [- 0.13,0.34]; p = 0.50) and NDD-CKD (MD: - 0.01; 95% CI [- 0.38,0.35]; p = 0.95) subgroups. Daprodustat significantly lowered hepcidin levels and significantly increased TIBC in both subgroups. Additionally, daprodustat significantly reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.89-0.98; p = 0.02) and its myocardial infarction (MI) component (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.59-0.92; p = 0.006) in the DD-CKD subgroup. CONCLUSION: Daprodustat has similar efficacy compared to rhEPO for the treatment of anemia of CKD. On treatment, the reduced experience of MACE was reported in DD-CKD patients as compared to rhEPO. Furthermore, effects on iron metabolism varied by parameter, with daprodustat being superior to rhEPO in some cases and inferior in others.","2022","European journal of clinical pharmacology"," PURPOSE : Anemia of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) has traditionally been treated with recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) ","Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kwon J. et al.","Total knee replacement (TKR) is associated with a large amount of bleeding; therefore, the prevalence of postoperative anemia is high. In particular, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more vulnerable to postoperative anemia than are healthy individuals. Accordingly, the effect of intraoperative intravenous ferric derisomaltose (FDI) supplementation on postoperative anemia and blood transfusion volume reduction in patients with CKD was studied. Patients who underwent unilateral TKR between January 2019 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. In analyzing the data, the patients fell into the CKD group (n = 85) and the non-CKD group (n = 106). Each group was divided into a group using FDI and a non-FDI group, and classified into 4 groups. The postoperative hemoglobin level for each postoperative day (POD) was determined as the primary outcome. In addition, the patient transfusion rate, volume of transfusion, and length of hospital stay were set as secondary study outcomes during the period from surgery to discharge. There was no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin levels on PODs 0, 1, 2, 7, and 14 in the CKD group. In the CKD group, the transfusion volume of the FDI group was 0.58 ± 0.91 units per person, which was statistically significantly lower than 1.28 ± 1.28 units of the non-FDI group (P = .01). In the CKD group, the transfusion rate of the FDI group was 30.2%, which was statistically significantly lower than that of the non-FDI group, which was 56.3% (P = .02). This study showed that intravenous FDI supplementation after TKR in CKD patients did not reduce postoperative anemia but was an effective and safe treatment to reduce transfusion volume and transfusion rate. There was no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin levels on POD 0, 1, 2, 7, and 14 in the non-CKD group. In the non-CKD group, the transfusion volume of the FDI group was 0.46 ± 0.88 units per person, which was lower than the 0.56 ± 0.91 units of the non-FDI group, but it was not statistically significant (P = .59).

The determinants of CA-AKI in patients with pre-existing CKD in an era of advanced strategies of CTO recanalization techniques need to be considered for a risk evaluation of the procedure. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 2504 recanalization procedures for a CTO between 2013 and 2022 was analyzed. Of these, 514 (20.5%) were done in patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min based on the most recently used CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation). RESULTS: The rate of patients classified to have CKD would be lower with 14.2% using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and 18.1% using the modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The technical success was high with 94.9% and 96.8% (p = 0.04) between patients with and without CKD. The incidence of CA-AKI was 9.9% versus 4.3% (p < 0.001). The major determinants of CA-AKI in patients with CKD were the presence of diabetes and a reduced ejection fraction, as well as periprocedural blood loss, whereas a higher baseline hemoglobin and the use of the radial approach prevented CA-AKI. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CKD CTO PCI could be performed successfully at a higher cost of CA-AKI. Correcting preprocedural anemia and avoiding intraprocedural blood loss may reduce the incidence of CA-AKI.","2023","Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression. After adjustment for eGFR and other important confounders, only cFGF23 but not iFGF23 was significantly associated with hemoglobin levels and this association was largely accounted for by iron metabolism parameters. cFGF23 but not iFGF23 was also associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), again in dependence on iron metabolism parameters. Similarly, EPO concentrations were associated with cFGF23 but not iFGF23, but their contribution to the association of cFGF23 with hemoglobin levels was marginal.

","Sugahara M. et al.","For the past 3 decades, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) in conjunction with iron supplementation has been the mainstay of treatment for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although ESAs are well-established and highly efficacious treatment, clinical trials demonstrated that the use of ESAs with a high hemoglobin (Hb) target was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. This safety concern raised considerable interest in developing an alternative therapeutic strategy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) are such novel agents to treat anemia in CKD. They stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production via HIF activation and thereby induce erythropoiesis. At least 6 small-molecule HIF-PHIs have been developed to date. The phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated that their effects were noninferior to ESAs. HIF-PHIs may have several advantages over the conventional treatment, such as oral route of administration and their ability to raise Hb levels in patients with chronic inflammation. Although many of the phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated that HIF-PHIs were noninferior to placebo or ESAs with respect to cardiovascular safety, one of the compounds failed to meet the prespecified noninferiority criterion in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, and some studies of another HIF-PHI indicated potential risks for thromboembolic events. While the regulatory agencies of some countries including Japan and the European Union concluded that roxadustat, one of the HIF-PHIs, had a favorable benefit-risk profile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration decided not to approve the drug because of safety reasons. In order to establish the optimal anemia management in CKD, further studies are needed to evaluate important aspects of HIF-PHIs, such as long-term safety, appropriate Hb target, and the types of patients who would gain benefits from these new drugs.","2022","Pharmacology & therapeutics",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Prespecified secondary analyses were performed to further study the effects of targeting higher hemoglobin levels on renal outcomes. METHODS: Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 8-20 ml/min/1.73 m(2) without diabetes were randomly assigned 1:1 to the high- and low-hemoglobin groups. The differences between the groups were evaluated for the following endpoints and cohort sets: eGFR and proteinuria slopes, assessed using a mixed-effects model in the full analysis set and the per-protocol set that excluded patients with off-target hemoglobin levels; the primary endpoint of composite renal outcome, evaluated in the per-protocol set using the Cox model. RESULTS: In the full analysis set (high hemoglobin, n = 239; low hemoglobin, n = 240), eGFR and proteinuria slopes were not significantly different between the groups. In the per-protocol set (high hemoglobin, n = 136; low hemoglobin, n = 171), the high-hemoglobin group was associated with reduced composite renal outcome (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.96) and an improved eGFR slope (coefficient: + 1.00 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year; 95% confidence interval: 0.38-1.63), while the proteinuria slope did not differ between the groups.

This IRON-CKD trial compared the effects of different IV irons on oxidative stress and inflammation. METHODS: In this randomized open-label explorative single-center study in the United Kingdom, non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with iron deficiency were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive a single infusion of 200 mg iron dextran, or 200 mg iron sucrose (IS), or 200 mg or 1,000 mg ferric derisomaltose (FDI) and were followed up for 3 months. The primary outcomes measured were induction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Secondarily, efficacy, vascular function, quality of life, and safety were monitored. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. No significant rise in oxidative stress existed, regardless of preparation or dose. There was a significant rise in LPI with 1,000 mg FDI at 2 hours that normalized within a week, not impacting oxidative stress or inflammation. A delayed rise in C-reactive protein was noted with IS. High-dose FDI produced a sustained serum ferritin increase (mean ± standard error of the mean of predose: 69.1 ± 18.4 μg/L, 3 months: 271.0 ± 83.3 μg/L; p = 0.007).

Eligible patients were adults with NDD-CKD stages 3b-5 who initiated ESA therapy for anemia between January and December 2015. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin (Hb) <13.0 g/dL (males) or <12.0 g/dL (females). Data regarding ESA treatment, treatment response, concomitant iron therapy and blood transfusions were extracted up to 24 months post-ESA initiation, and data on CKD progression until abstraction date. RESULTS: Eight hundred and forty-eight medical records were abstracted. Approximately 40% received no iron therapy prior to ESA initiation. At ESA initiation, mean ± standard deviation Hb level was 9.8 ± 1.0 g/dL. Most patients received darbepoetin alfa, and switching between ESAs was rare (8.5% of patients).

,"36990212"," A single approach to targeting transferrin receptor 2 corrects iron and erythropoietic defects in murine models of anemia of inflammation and chronic kidney disease. ","Olivari V. et al.","Anemia is a common complication of systemic inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines both decrease erythroblast sensitivity to erythropoietin (EPO) and increase the levels of the hepatic hormone hepcidin, sequestering iron in stores and causing functional iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a peculiar form of anemia of inflammation, characterized by impaired EPO production paralleling progressive kidney damage. Traditional therapy based on increased EPO (often in combination with iron) may have off-target effects due to EPO interaction with its non-erythroid receptors. Transferrin Receptor 2 (Tfr2) is a mediator of the iron-erythropoiesis crosstalk. Its deletion in the liver hampers hepcidin production, increasing iron absorption, whereas its deletion in the hematopoietic compartment increases erythroid EPO sensitivity and red blood cell production. Here, we show that selective hematopoietic Tfr2 deletion ameliorates anemia in mice with sterile inflammation in the presence of normal kidney function, promoting EPO responsiveness and erythropoiesis without increasing serum EPO levels. In mice with CKD, characterized by absolute rather than functional iron deficiency, Tfr2 hematopoietic deletion had a similar effect on erythropoiesis but anemia improvement was transient because of limited iron availability. Also, increasing iron levels by downregulating only hepatic Tfr2 had a minor effect on anemia. However, simultaneous deletion of hematopoietic and hepatic Tfr2, stimulating erythropoiesis and increased iron supply, was sufficient to ameliorate anemia for the entire protocol. Thus, our results suggest that combined targeting of hematopoietic and hepatic Tfr2 may be a therapeutic option to balance erythropoiesis stimulation and iron increase, without affecting EPO levels.","2023","Kidney international",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Strauss W. et al.","BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease and is often treated with intravenous iron. There are few trials directly comparing the safety and efficacy of different intravenous iron products. METHODS: This post-hoc analysis pooled data from 767 patients enrolled in two randomized, controlled, open-label trials of similar design comparing the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with ferumoxytol and iron sucrose across patients with all stages of renal function. One trial was conducted in adults with CKD either on or not on dialysis and the second in adults with IDA of any underlying cause and a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used who had normal to no worse than moderately impaired renal function. Patients were categorized by chronic kidney disease stage (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5. RESULTS: The overall incidence of adverse events was numerically lower in ferumoxytol-treated patients compared to those treated with iron sucrose (42.4 vs. 50.2 %, respectively); the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was generally similar between the two treatment groups (13.6 vs. 16.0 %, respectively). Adverse events of Special Interest (i.e., hypotension, hypersensitivity) occurred at lower rates in those treated with ferumoxytol compared to those treated with iron sucrose (2.5 vs. 5.3 %, respectively). Overall, mean hemoglobin increased in both treatment groups, regardless of degree of renal insufficiency, although greater increases were seen among those with less severe kidney damage. Mean increases in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 were significantly greater with ferumoxytol than with iron sucrose treatment in the subgroup with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90 mL/min (Least Squares mean difference = 0.53 g/dL; p < 0.001).

We examined the prognostic value of retinopathy in assessing the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular morbidity or death among patients in the Trial to Reduce cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT). DESIGN: TREAT enrolled 4038 patients with T2DM, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and moderate anemia. Patients were grouped by baseline history of retinopathy. Proportional hazards regression models were utilized to assess the association between retinopathy and subsequent ESRD, cardiovascular morbidity or death over an average of 2.4 years. RESULTS: Although younger, the 1895 (47%) patients with retinopathy had longer duration of diabetes, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, more proteinuria, and more microvascular complications. In univariate analysis, retinopathy was associated with a higher rate of ESRD, but not with cardiovascular events or mortality. After adjustment, retinopathy was no longer statistically significant for the prediction of ESRD or any clinical endpoint.

METHODS: In total, 588 patients with a clinical diagnosis of anemia due to CKD without dialysis need and with baseline hemoglobin of 7.0-10.0 g/dL (inclusive) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either desidustat 100 mg oral tablets thrice a week for 24 weeks or biosimilar darbepoetin subcutaneous injection 0.75 μg/kg once in 2 weeks for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in hemoglobin to evaluation period of Weeks 16-24. Key secondary outcomes included the number of patients with hemoglobin response, changes in the hepcidin levels, changes in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, and changes in the lipid and lipoprotein profiles.

Our systematic review aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of daprodustat for anemia treatment in both dialysis-dependent (DD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) patients. Methods: Six databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting daprodustat vs. rhEPO or placebo for anemia patients in CKD. The outcome indicators were focused on hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Results: Eight eligible studies with 1,516 participants were included. For both NDD and DD patients, changes in Hb levels from baseline were significantly higher in daprodustat group than that in the placebo (mean difference (MD) = 1.73, [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 3.12], p = 0.01; MD = 1.88, [95% CI, 0.68 to 3.09], p = 0.002; respectively), and there was no significant difference between daprodustat and rhEPO group (MD = 0.05, [95% CI, -0.49 to 0.59], p = 0.86; MD = 0.12, [95% CI, -0.28 to 0.52], p = 0.55; respectively). The indexes of iron metabolism were improved significantly in the daprodustat group compared to placebo- or rhEPO-treated patients, while there was no similar change in terms of TSAT for DD patients. Furthermore, no trend of increasing plasma VEGF was observed in daprodustat-treated subjects. As for safety, there was no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs between daprodustat and placebo treatment, while the incidence of SAEs in the daprodustat group was significantly lower than that in the rhEPO group. Conclusion: Daprodustat was efficacious and well tolerated for anemia in both NDD and DD patients in the short term based on current RCTs.

","Vlasschaert C. et al.","BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an inflammatory premalignant disorder resulting from acquired genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. This condition is common in aging populations and associated with cardiovascular morbidity and overall mortality, but its role in CKD is unknown. METHODS: We performed targeted sequencing to detect CHIP mutations in two independent cohorts of 87 and 85 adults with an eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73m(2). We also assessed kidney function, hematologic, and mineral bone disease parameters cross-sectionally at baseline, and collected creatinine measurements over the following 5-year period. RESULTS: At baseline, CHIP was detected in 18 of 87 (21%) and 25 of 85 (29%) cohort participants. Participants with CHIP were at higher risk of kidney failure, as predicted by the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE), compared with those without CHIP. Individuals with CHIP manifested a 2.2-fold increased risk of a 50% decline in eGFR or ESKD over 5 years of follow-up (hazard ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.8) in a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, and baseline eGFR. The addition of CHIP to 2-year and 5-year calibrated KFRE risk models improved ESKD predictions. Those with CHIP also had lower hemoglobin, higher ferritin, and higher red blood cell mean corpuscular volume versus those without CHIP. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis of individuals with preexisting CKD, CHIP was associated with higher baseline KFRE scores, greater progression of CKD, and anemia.

However, controversy remains as to whether total correction of anemia provides benefits over and above those afforded by partial correction. There is some evidence showing that normalization of hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations may improve the cardiac hyperdynamic state in CKD patients and reduce the diameter of the left ventricle. Further studies have shown that normalization of Hb improves cognitive function and physical capacities as measured by quality of life (QoL) tests. Large studies have shown that in dialysis patients there is a close inverse relationship between hematocrit (Hct) levels and mortality and morbidity. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that Hct levels higher than those recommended by European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) and the National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcome and Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI provide better outcomes for patients with CKD. However, when Hb concentrations are increased to normal in selected patients with cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, or ischemic cardiopathy, higher mortality rates are evident. Therefore, while the majority of patients with CKD may experience significant benefits when Hb is normalized, it seems prudent to recommend individualized target Hb concentrations for each patient, taking into account factors such as age, sex, employment status, physical activity, and co-morbidities.","2002","Kidney international.

They increase endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production by stabilizing HIF. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which PHD inhibitors ameliorate anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and summarizes the current clinical experience with and prospects for these drugs. SUMMARY: Anemia is a serious complication of CKD and is an independent risk factor for congestive heart failure. Appropriate treatment of anemia is important in the management of advanced stage CKD, as it might help to extend life expectancy and improve the physical function of patients with CKD. However, at present, adverse effects of treatment, such as thromboembolic events, as well as high therapeutic cost have a negative impact on society. PHD inhibitors stabilize the transcription factor HIF, increasing the expression of downstream target genes, including EPO and enzymes involved in iron metabolism, resulting in increased EPO production and improved iron utilization. Key Messages: The potential advantages of PHD inhibitors over conventional EPO-based therapies include a more physiologic response to renal anemia, noninvasive oral administration, and lower cost. Phase III trials of more than 5 PHD inhibitors are ongoing, with overall demonstration of success in increasing hemoglobin levels. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of PHD inhibitors in improving renal anemia in CKD and summarize the current clinical findings regarding these drugs.","2019","Contributions to nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"29659573"," Whole-body iron transport and metabolism: Mechanistic, multi-scale model to improve treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. ","Sarkar J. et al.","Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron in vivo, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This in silico whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.","2018","PLoS computational biology"," Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin ","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Vitamin E-coated membranes (VECMs) consist of a multilayer membrane with liposoluble vitamin E on the blood surface allowing direct free radical scavenging at the membrane site, which is of potential clinical benefit. Our objective was to examine the effect of VECMs on anemia in chronic hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: We enrolled 172 stable chronic HD patients (94 men, 78 women, age 65.4 +/- 13.4 years) in an open-label multicenter study. They were shifted from their previous dialyzer to VECM for 1 year. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) dosage were analyzed after 4, 8, and 12 months on the VECM and compared with baseline values using paired tests. RESULTS: Hb significantly increased from 10.9 +/- 1.2 g/dL at baseline to 11.7 +/- 1.2 g/dL after 12 months (p<0.001) on VECMs. Conversely, the rHuEpo dosage decreased from 7,762 +/- 5,865 IU/week at baseline to 6,390 +/- 5,679 IU/week after 12 months (p<0.001). The proportion of patients who were at target Hb levels (European Best Practice Guidelines) increased from 49.4% at baseline to 80% after 12 months (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis with VECM in stable chronic HD patients was associated with significantly improved Hb levels and lower rHuEpo requirements. These results suggest that the antioxidant properties of VECMs may impact favorably on anemia management in chronic HD patients. Possible mechanisms include enhanced membrane biocompatibility, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation with VECMs, resulting in improved red blood cell survival and/or rHuEpo responsiveness. This therapy may potentially contribute to more effective anemia management in hemodialysis patients, and merits further rigorous study.","2008","The International journal of artificial organs"," Our objective was to examine the effect of VECMs on anemia in chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"18451683"," Insights in anemia management. ","de F. and Piñera C.","After almost 20 years, anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its treatment remain the focus of multiple questions for clinicians and investigators. The optimal hemoglobin (Hb) for patients with CKD is controversial and different targets are probably required for different populations. The current literature does not support an upper Hb target >12 g/dl and there is a clear demonstration of increased risk with Hb targets >13 g/dl. With this narrow target of 11-12 g/dl, fluctuations in Hb concentration are commonly observed in patients being treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Studies to date provide a suggestion of an association between Hb cycling and mortality, but they have been primarily exploratory in nature and clinical trials comparing treatment strategies leading to different degrees of Hb variability are needed. The great majority of incidences of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was associated with ESA therapy and was first recognized several years ago after a change in the formulation in which human serum albumin was eliminated and replaced by polysorbate-80 in patients on epoetin alfa (Eprex). Years later, a registry (PRIMS) was established by the health authorities as part of a reapproval of the subcutaneous route to confirm that the cause of PRCA has been eliminated. The ongoing PRIMS study is a 3-year observation period prospective multicenter and international (Europe and Australia) registry that could serve as a model for assessment of the immunogenicity profiles of currently marketed and future ESAs. The association with a change in formulation makes PRCA of interest to the biotechnology industry as well as the medical community because it raises the broader question of the potential immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals in general.","2008","Contributions to nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Outcome superiority was tested (1-sided alpha level of 0.025). Overall, 614 participants with non-dialysis-dependent CKD were randomized. The adjusted mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to the evaluation period was greater with daprodustat (1.58 vs 0.19 g/dl). The adjusted mean treatment difference (AMD) was significant at 1.40 g/dl (95% confidence interval 1.23, 1.56). A significantly greater proportion of participants receiving daprodustat showed a 1 g/dl or greater increase in hemoglobin from baseline (77% vs 18%). The mean SF-36 Vitality score increased by 7.3 and 1.9 points with daprodustat and placebo, respectively; a clinically and statistically significant 5.4 point Week 28 AMD increase.

","Hao C. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that may reduce patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study explored the experience and knowledge of patients with CKD, with and without anemia, in China. METHODS: A quantitative online survey was administered to 500 consenting Chinese patient volunteers aged ≥18 years with self-reported CKD, with or without anemia, between August 29, and September 17, 2018. Patients with cancer were excluded. The 27-question survey explored knowledge of anemia, HRQoL, anemia management, and interactions with healthcare providers. RESULTS: Of 456 evaluable patients, 148 (32.5%) reported having anemia and 262 (57.5%) did not. Knowledge of anemia and its symptoms varied, and approximately half of all patients did not know their hemoglobin level. Patients with anemia expressed an adverse impact of anemia on HRQoL, most commonly lack of energy (65.5%), sadness/depression (54.1%), and feeling ill (50.0%). The most frequently reported treatments among these patients were dietary advice (68.9%), iron supplements (63.5%), and oral medications (53.4%). Although 89.2% of patients with anemia trusted their healthcare providers above other information sources, only 29.0% reported seeking information from them; this was despite 92.6% reporting wanting further information and support about managing conditions like anemia. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patients with CKD, both with and without anemia, would benefit from increased awareness of anemia and more in-depth discussions with healthcare providers in order to facilitate better management of CKD and optimization of treatment plans.","2021","International journal of nephrology and renovascular disease",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a relatively novel intravenous iron formulation used in different clinical settings, although scarce data exist in NDD-CKD patients. Primary objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of FCM compared with oral ferrous sulfate for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in a cohort of NDD-CKD patients, considering also the treatment costs. This was a monocentric, retrospective observational study reviewing 349 NDD-CKD patients attending an outpatient clinic between June 2013 and December 2016. Patients were treated by either FCM intravenous infusion or oral ferrous sulfate. We collected serum values of hemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ESAs doses at 12 and 18 months. The costs related to both treatments were also analysed. 239 patients were treated with FCM intravenous infusion and 110 patients with oral ferrous sulfate. The two groups were not statistically different for age, BMI and eGFR values. At 18 months, hemoglobin, serum ferritin and TSAT values increased significantly from baseline in the FCM group, compared with the ferrous sulfate group. ESAs dose and rate of infusion decreased only in the FCM group. At 18 months, the treatment costs, analysed per week, was higher in the ferrous sulfate group, compared with the FCM group, and this was mostly due to a reduction in ESAs prescription in the FCM group. Routine intravenous FCM treatment in an outpatient clinic of NDD-CKD patients results in better correction of iron-deficiency anemia when compared to ferrous sulfate. In addition to this, treating NDD-CKD patients with FCM leads to a significant reduction of the treatment costs by reducing ESAs use.","2021","Scientific reports"," Primary objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of FCM compared with oral ferrous sulfate for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in a cohort of NDD-CKD patients , considering also the treatment costs ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Whether an association between PTH and hemoglobin also exists in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis (CKD-patients) is still unclear. In this study we evaluated the association between PTH and hemoglobin in CKD-patients without severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: Hospitalized patients and outpatients (N = 979) were retrospectively evaluated and categorized according to PTH quartile and serum hemoglobin (<12.0, <11.0, <10.0 g/dl). Gender, diabetes, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), hemoglobin, PTH, markers of mineral metabolism, inflammation, iron status and nutrition were variables of adjustment in univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: An inverse association (p = 0.001) was observed between PTH and hemoglobin in patients as a whole, in diabetics, and in patients with GFR ≤60 ml/min. PTH was the single predictor of low hemoglobin in patients as a whole (unstandardized beta -2.12; p = 0.005), in diabetics (unstandardized beta -8.86; p = 0.007) and in patients with GFR ≤60 ml/min (unstandardized beta -2.52; p = 0.006). For each increase of quartile of PTH the risk of having hemoglobin level <10.0 mg/dl was more than doubled [hazard ratio (HR) 2.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00-3.88; p = 0.001]. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that PTH ≥122 pg/ml had 67% sensitivity and 75% specificity in predicting hemoglobin level <10.0 g/dl with area under the curve of 0.758 (95% CI 0.73-0.78). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a significant inverse association between PTH and hemoglobin levels across the whole spectrum of non-dialysis CKD and a doubled risk of having serum hemoglobin <10.0 mg/dl in the absence of severely deranged PTH concentration.

In contrast to conventional exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) administration, HIF-PHIs stimulate endogenous EPO production and improve iron metabolism via stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). This review summarizes the mechanism of action, the results of clinical trials, and future perspectives of HIF-PHIs. RECENT FINDINGS: Six HIF-PHIs are currently under phase III studies, some of which have been already completed. According to the results of clinical trials, HIF-PHIs increased and maintained hemoglobin levels in both nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients with physiological EPO concentrations. HIF-PHIs also improved iron utilization and were comparably effective regardless of underlying inflammation and iron status. SUMMARY: HIF-PHIs have several advantages including oral administration, physiological EPO secretion, and improved iron utilization. Undoubtedly, HIF-PHIs will pave the new way in the field of treatment of anemia in CKD, but it should be noted that HIFs have pleiotropic effects on a plethora of cellular functions, which might lead to either beneficial or undesirable off-target effects.

Outcomes in the ensuing 2 years were compared in patients with and those without anemia (entry period, 1998-1999; follow-up period, 2000-2001). RESULTS: Of 41,522 CKD patients identified, 49.0% had claims of anemia diagnosis. The factors associated (p< 0.0001) with anemia included older age, female gender, black race, and all 10 comorbid conditions studied; adjusted odds ratios (ORs) exceeded 1.5 for age 80 years old or older (OR, 1.54 compared to <70 years), for black race (OR, 1.52), and for co-existing diagnoses of congestive heart failure (OR, 1.64), gastrointestinal bleeding (OR, 3.65), and liver disease (OR, 2.16). During the follow-up period, outcome event rates (expressed per 1000 patient-years) were as follows: renal replacement therapy, 23.5; death, 186.4; congestive heart failure, 390.0; atherosclerotic vascular disease, 410.5; and first hospitalization, 552.6.

METHODS: This single-center, prospective, single-arm comparison study enrolled patients with non-dialysis CKD (stages 4-5) and hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL. ESA administration followed the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline. The primary endpoint was the change in flow-mediated dilatation after ESA administration in individual patients. The secondary endpoints were changes in 6-minute walk test results, blood pressure, New York Heart Association class, and echocardiographic parameters. The echocardiographic parameters examined included chamber quantification, Doppler parameters, and systolic and diastolic function parameters. RESULTS: Initially, 13 patients were screened, but 2 discontinued due to either heart failure or voluntary withdrawal. The mean flow-mediated dilatation values significantly increased by 10.59% (from 1.36% ± 1.91% to 11.95% ± 8.11%, P = .001). Echocardiographic findings showed that the left ventricular mass index decreased by 11.9 g/m2 (from 105.8 ± 16.3 to 93.9 ± 19.5 g/m2, P = .006), and the left atrial volume index decreased by 10.8 mL/m2 (from 50.1 ± 11.3 to 39.3 ± 11.3 mL/m2, P = .004) after 12 weeks of ESA administration. There were no significant differences between pre- and post-ESA treatment 6-minute walk test results. No significant side effects were observed during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical study to demonstrate that an ESA improves endothelial dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and left atrial volume in patients with non-dialysis CKD.

","Brown J. et al.","In patients with diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) is commonly interpreted as a measure of long-term glycemic control, reflecting a mean glucose level over the previous 2-3 months. Although some reports suggest that treatment with recombinant erythropoietin may affect A1C values in patients undergoing hemodialysis, we know of no evidence to support this interaction in patients with chronic renal insufficiency who are not undergoing hemodialysis. In addition, we know of no evidence specific to the treatment effect of epoetin alfa and/or darbepoetin alfa on A1C. We describe a 64-year-old man with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and anemia who was treated consecutively with epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa and experienced a temporal reduction in A1C level to a nadir of 4.4%. Throughout approximately 3 years of treatment with these erythropoietin analogs, the patient's total daily dose of insulin was reduced in response to his decreasing A1C values, despite elevated blood glucose levels and the absence of patient-reported hypoglycemic events. Five months after the patient's erythropoietin therapy was discontinued, his A1C value increased to 8.8%, leading us to conclude that management of the insulin dose may have been different without the falsely lowered A1C levels. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable association between this patient's reduced A1C levels and erythropoietin therapy. This case demonstrates that both epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa may artificially lower A1C levels in a patient with diabetes who is not undergoing dialysis, and therefore this finding can be interpreted as a class effect. Clinicians should be aware of factors that affect A1C values, specifically erythrocyte life span. In patients receiving erythropoietin, therapeutic decisions should be based on A1C and glucose levels, as well as patient symptoms suggestive of hypo- or hyperglycemia, to avoid therapy changes that could complicate disease management.","2009","Pharmacotherapy",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Agarwal R. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Anemia frequently occurs in chronic kidney disease (CKD), is associated with poor quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes, and its treatment represents a considerable economic burden to the healthcare system. Although effective, the current standard of care for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease patients with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents requires chronic/ongoing injections, making the treatment less accessible or desirable to patients not treated by in-center maintenance hemodialysis. Furthermore, safety concerns, including an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, have emerged from their use in studies targeting hemoglobin concentrations in the normal or near-normal range. The orally active hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor vadadustat may offer advantages over erythropoiesis-stimulating agents by correcting anemia via pathways activating endogenous erythropoietin production. METHODS: To comprehensively analyze the safety profile of vadadustat in patients with dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent CKD-related anemia, we pooled the safety populations from each of the four trials in the phase 3 clinical program (n = 7,373) and compared the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for each treatment arm. RESULTS: In patients randomized to vadadustat versus darbepoetin alfa, rates of TEAEs (88.9% vs. 89.3%), treatment-emergent serious adverse events (58.0% vs. 59.3%), and TEAEs leading to death (16.1% vs. 16.2%) were similar, as were rates of adverse events of special interest, including cardiovascular-, hepatic-, and neoplasm-related adverse events.

Hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated as well as serum and tissue (kidney, liver and/or duodenum) protein and/or gene expression of mediators of erythropoiesis, iron metabolism and tissue hypoxia, inflammation, and fibrosis. Long-term treatment with a high rHuEPO dose is associated with development of resistance to therapy as a result of antibodies formation. In this condition, serum EPO levels are not deficient and iron availability is recovered by increased duodenal absorption. However, erythropoiesis is not stimulated, and the resistance to endogenous EPO effect and to rHuEPO therapy results from the development of a hypoxic, inflammatory and fibrotic milieu in the kidney tissue.

After adjustment, patients with comorbidity of the triad of CKD, diabetes and the lower HbA(1c) range had significantly higher hazard ratios (HR) for certification (HR 3.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.91-6.48, P < 0.001) and for death (HR 3.79, 95% CI 1.46-9.85, P = 0.006) compared with those without CKD and diabetes. The harmful impact of the lower HbA(1c) range on later certification compared with higher HbA(1c) range of ≥6.0% was maintained in diabetes patients with use of antidiabetic agents and CKD (HR 2.40, 95% CI 1.06-6.45, P = 0.036).

","Akizawa T. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Enarodustat (JTZ-951) is a new oral hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of enarodustat with darbepoetin alfa (DA) in Japanese anemic patients with CKD receiving maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: Subjects receiving maintenance hemodialysis were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive oral enarodustat once daily or intravenous DA every week for 24 weeks with dose adjustment every 4 weeks to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) within a target range (≥10.0 to <12.0 g/dL). The primary efficacy endpoint was difference in mean Hb level between arms during the evaluation period defined as weeks 20-24 (noninferiority margin: -1.0 g/dL). Intravenous iron preparations were prohibited during the screening period and during weeks 0-4. RESULTS: The mean Hb level of each arm during the evaluation period was 10.73 g/dL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.56, 10.91) in the enarodustat arm and 10.85 g/dL (95% CI: 10.72, 10.98) in the DA arm. The difference in the mean Hb level between arms was -0.12 g/dL (95% CI: -0.33, 0.10), confirming the noninferiority of enarodustat to DA. The mean Hb level of each arm was maintained within the target range during the treatment period. Increased total iron-binding capacity and serum iron and decreased hepcidin were observed through week 4 in the enarodustat arm albeit after switching from erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. No apparent safety concerns of enarodustat were observed compared with DA. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Enarodustat was noninferior to DA for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and was generally well tolerated over 24 weeks.","2021","Kidney diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kidanewold A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia is an adverse outcome and common complication in chronic kidney disease patients. This is usually associated with iron deficiency, inflammation and blood loss. However, little is known about the prevalence of anemia and its predictors among chronic kidney disease patients in Southern Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine anemia and its predictors among adult non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients in Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 chronic kidney disease patients from February to April 2019. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaires and medical records. Adjusted hemoglobin was taken to define anemia using the level of Hgb <13 mg/dL for males and <12 mg/dL for females; and blood films and serum ferritin were done for anemic participants. SPSS version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Frequency distribution tables and graphs were used to describe descriptive statistics. A bivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors; p <.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anemia was 44.0% (95% CI: 39.0%, 48.9%); of which 7.1%, 62.1% and 30.8% of anemic patients had mild, moderate and severe anemia, respectively. The prevalence of anemia increased from 20.6% in stage 2 to 100% in stage 5. Morphologically, normocytic normochromic anemia was the most predominant type. Cardiovascular disease (AOR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.35, 4.16), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 2.77, 95% CI: 1.08, 7.14), stage 3b chronic kidney disease (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.31, 5.73) and stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients (AOR = 7.11, 95% CI: 3.22, 15.72) showed significant association with anemia. CONCLUSION: Anemia was a severe public health problem and associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and stages of chronic kidney disease.

LI","Adler M. et al.","After relative erythropoietin deficiency, iron deficiency is the second most important contributing factor for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Iron supplementation is a crucial part of the treatment of anemia in CKD patients, and intravenous (IV) iron supplementation is considered to be superior to per os (PO) iron supplementation. The differences between the available formulations are poorly characterized. This report presents results from pairwise and network meta-analyses carried out after a comprehensive search in sources of published and unpublished studies, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations (International prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO reference ID: CRD42020148155). Meta-analytic calculations were performed for the outcome of non-response to iron supplementation (i.e., hemoglobin (Hgb) increase of <0.5-1.0 g/dL, or initiation/intensification of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy, or increase/change of iron supplement, or requirements of blood transfusion). A total of 34 randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified, providing numerical data for analyses covering 93.7% (n = 10.097) of the total study population. At the network level, iron supplementation seems to have a more protective effect against the outcome of non-response before the start of dialysis than once dialysis is initiated, and some preparations seem to be more potent (e.g., ferumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose), compared to the rest of iron supplements assessed (surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) > 0.8). This study provides parameters for adequately following-up patients requiring iron supplementation, by presenting the most performing preparations, and, indirectly, by making it possible to identify good responders among all patients treated with these medicines.","2020","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Liberti M. et al.","In non-dialysis-chronic kidney disease (CKD), iron deficiency is a frequent nutritional disorder due to either the greater tendency to occult gastrointestinal bleeding or to the chronic inflammatory state resulting in a reduced intestinal iron reabsorption through an increased synthesis of hepcidin. These phenomenon are responsible for a negative iron balance that compromises erythropoiesis and contributes to the pathogenesis of anemia in CKD. Several laboratory tests are now available to allow an adequate diagnosis of iron deficiency. Among the new parameters, the percentage of hypochromic red cells (% HYPO) and the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) are now considered as the most specific markers for diagnosing iron-deficiency erythropoiesis. Unfortunately, their implementation in clinical practice is limited by the scarce availability. In non-dialyzed CKD , subjects intolerant or non-responsive to oral iron therapy, can be effectively treated with novel intravenous iron preparations, such as iron carboxymaltose, that allow a complete and rapid correction of iron deficient anemia. Furthermore, this iron compound is associated with lower rate of adverse effects since the carbohydrate shell (carboxymaltose) is more stable than gluconate and saccarate thus reducing the release of free iron in the bloodstream. Of note, the possibility of administering this drug at high doses and reduced frequency decreases the risk of infusion reactions. Finally, a substantial economic saving mainly dependent on a reduction in indirect costs represents a further advantage in the use of iron carboxymaltose in this population.","2017","Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This trend has gone together with the publication of findings of observational studies showing a relationship between the increase in hemoglobin levels and a reduction in the mortality risk, with the conduction of clinical trials testing the effects of complete anemia correction, and with the compilation of guidelines on anemia control in CKD patients by scientific societies and organizations. In the last two years, evidence of a possible increase in the mortality risk in those patients who were randomized to high hemoglobin levels has resulted in a decrease in the upper limit of the recommended Hb target to be obtained with erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA), and consequently in a narrowing of the target range.

,"33777494"," Anemia of cardiorenal syndrome. ","McCullough P.","Cardiorenal syndrome includes a spectrum of disorders of the kidneys and heart in which loss of function in one organ contributes to reduced function in the other organ. Cardiorenal syndrome is frequently complicated by comorbid anemia, which leads to reciprocal and progressive cardiac and renal deterioration. The triad of heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and anemia is termed cardiorenal anemia syndrome (CRAS). There are currently no evidence-based recommendations for managing patients with CRAS; however, the treatment of these patients is multifactorial. Not only must the anemia be controlled, but heart failure and kidney injury must be addressed, in addition to other comorbidities. Intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are the mainstays of treatment for anemia of CKD, addressing both iron and erythropoiesis deficiencies. Since erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy can be associated with adverse outcomes at higher doses in patients with CKD and is not used in routine practice in patients with heart failure, treatment options for managing anemia in patients with CRAS are limited. Several new therapies, particularly the hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, are currently under clinical development. The hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors have shown promising results for treating anemia of CKD in clinical trials and may confer benefits in patients with CRAS, potentially addressing some of the limitations of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Updated clinical practice guidelines for the screening and management of anemia in cardiorenal syndrome, in light of potential new therapies and clinical evidence, would improve the clinical outcomes of patients with this complex syndrome.","2021","Kidney international supplements",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

In addition, whether anemia and hyperuricemia only influence renal damage in combination with other comorbidities or whether they are direct causative factors is also controversial. Therefore, the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate these issues in a large Taiwanese cohort. We enrolled 26,631 participants from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) after excluding those with CKD at the baseline, all of whom had follow-up data for a median of 4 years. In this study, CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, incident new-onset CKD was defined as the development of CKD during follow-up, anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level <13 mg/dL in males and <12 mg/dL in females, and hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid (UA) level >7 mg/dL in males and >6 mg/dL in females. The participants were divided into four groups according to whether or not they had anemia and hyperuricemia.

A total of 523 non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages G1-G5 patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events over a 5.5-year period. A negative correlation was found between albumin and between hemoglobin, and both total and free pCS and pCG. In multiple linear regression, PBUTs were negatively associated with eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and hemoglobin but not albumin. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, albumin was a predictor of outcome, independent of pCS and pCG, without interactions between albumin and pCS or pCG. The relation of low hemoglobin with adverse outcome was lost when albumin was entered into the model. Lower concentrations of pCS and pCG are associated with higher serum albumin and hemoglobin. This may indicate that there are two pathways in the blood that potentially contribute to attenuating the vasculotoxic effects of these PBUTs. The association of PBUTs with cardiovascular risk is not explained by albumin levels, which remains a strong and independent predictor for adverse outcome.","2022","Journal of personalized medicine",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

All patients underwent echocardiography in order to assess left ventricular (LV) morphology and function. The results showed that in the group of patients with hemoglobin levels under 110 g/L BNP levels were significantly elevated (p < 0.001), as well as left ventricular mass index (p < 0.001). Systolic and diastolic LV function were significantly better in patients with hemoglobin levels above 110 g/L (p < 0.001).

Significantly negative correlation between BNP level and creatinine clearance (p = 0.009), and significantly positive correlation between BNP level and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were established. A similar but positive relationship was observed between hemoglobin levels and creatinine clearance (p < 0.01). We established statistically significant negative correlation between hemoglobin levels and LVMI (r = -0.564, p < 0.001). In conclusion, BNP and hemoglobin levels depend on the renal function.

","Uehata T. et al.","BACKGROUND: Hepcidin is a central regulator of iron homeostasis. Increased hepcidin concentrations could cause iron-restricted erythropoiesis in chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated anemia. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted to evaluate the association between hepcidin and CKD-associated anemia in non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS: A total of 505 non-dialysis CKD patients not treated with parenteral iron were recruited, and serum hepcidin-25 levels were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between hepcidin and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the relationship between hemoglobin concentration and predictors including the hepcidin level. RESULTS: The median hepcidin level among the 505 CKD patients was 15.4 ng/mL (interquartile range, 5.5-33.6 ng/mL). Although hepcidin level significantly increased according to the CKD stage, multivariate analysis did not reveal an association of GFR with the hepcidin level. Hepcidin level was a significant predictor of hemoglobin concentration after the adjustment for confounders, and a significant interaction between hepcidin and ferritin was found. After stratifying at the median ferritin level, 91 ng/mL, we found a negative association between hepcidin level and hemoglobin in the high-ferritin group. A trend toward a negative association between hepcidin level and mean corpuscular volume was observed in the high-ferritin group. CONCLUSIONS: Serum hepcidin-25 levels were negatively associated with hemoglobin concentrations in non-dialysis CKD patients with sufficient iron stores. We found that ferritin modified the association between hepcidin level and hemoglobin concentration.

For new-onset CKD, proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were examined separately. Rapid deterioration of renal function was defined as an eGFR ≥25% less than the previous year. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that in addition to age and impaired glucose tolerance, anemia and atrial fibrillation (AF) were risk factors for the new appearance of proteinuria.

Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <12 g/dL (women) and <13 g/dL (men). Cox proportional hazards models were used to establish predictors for death. RESULTS: At baseline, 98 individuals (42.2%) had criteria for CKD and 41 (17.7%) for anemia. During follow-up, 136 patients (58.6%) died. Independently, CKD and anemia were not associated with all-cause mortality. However, when they coexisted, an additional risk was attributed for these patients. Cox proportional hazard models analysis identified systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98 to 1.00; P=0.015), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.85; P=0.012), left anterior fascicular block (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.13; P=0.017), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.06; P < 0.001), and serum sodium (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99; P=0.020) as independent predictors for death. CONCLUSIONS: CKD and anemia are not independent predictors for long-term mortality in CC patients. However, the prognosis is poorer in individuals with both comorbidities.","2020","Cardiology research and practice",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Haase V.","Hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) are a promising new class of orally administered drugs currently in late-stage global clinical development for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). HIF-PHIs activate the HIF oxygen-sensing pathway and are efficacious in correcting and maintaining hemoglobin levels in patients with non-dialysis- and dialysis-dependent CKD. In addition to promoting erythropoiesis through the increase in endogenous erythropoietin production, HIF-PHIs reduce hepcidin levels and modulate iron metabolism, providing increases in total iron binding capacity and transferrin levels, and potentially reducing the need for i.v. iron supplementation. Furthermore, HIF-activating drugs are predicted to have effects that extend beyond erythropoiesis. This review summarizes clinical data from current HIF-PHI trials in patients with anemia of CKD, discusses mechanisms of action and pharmacologic properties of HIF-PHIs, and deliberates over safety concerns and potential impact on anemia management in patients with CKD.","2021","Kidney international supplements",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Yang C. et al.","OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between anemia and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients, and whether the association is modified by the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Physical examination data of 8 563 patients with diabetes who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria between 2010 and 2011 were collected, based on the prospective cohort data of Kailuan study. The deadline of the follow-up was December 31, 2015, and the endpoints comprised all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association between anemia with or without CKD, and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: The average age of the subjects was (57.3±10.3) years, of whom the patients with anemia accounted for 5.2%. The proportion of the patients with anemia combined with CKD was higher than that of the patients without anemia (27.2% vs. 20.8%, P=0.001). The median follow-up time was 4.9 years (interquartile range: 4.6-5.2 years). During the follow-up period, 559 patients died, and 434 patients had cardiovascular disease. Compared with the patients without anemia, the all-cause mortality rate of the patients with anemia was higher (3 220.3/100 000 person-years vs. 1 257.9/100 000 person-years, P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular disease between the above two groups (999.8/100 000 person-years vs. 1 081.2/100 000 person-years, P>0.05). The mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease among the patients with CKD were higher than those of the patients without CKD (2 558.3/100 000 person-years vs. 1 044.0/100 000 person-years, P<0.001; 1 605.9/100 000 person-years vs. 941.6/100 000 person-years, P<0.001). Results of Cox regression model showed that, after adjustment for confounding factors, the all-cause mortality risk increased by 95% in the diabetic patients with anemia (HR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.50-2.54). Anemia and CKD significantly increased the mortality risk among diabetic patients (HR=3.61, 95% CI: 2.48-5.26). The CKD patients without anemia had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (HR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.13-1.74). CONCLUSION: Anemia is associated with an increased mortality risk in Chinese diabetic patients. Patients with CKD have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The all-cause mortality risk increases significantly in anemia patients with the presence of CKD, which indicates that we should focus on the prevention and treatment of diabetic patients with anemia and CKD.","2018","Beijing da xue xue bao.

","Mima A.","Anemia is a common feature and complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and recombinant human erythropoietin have been used widely in renal anemia treatment. Recently, hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) that may improve the treatment of renal anemia patients were launched. Previous studies indicated that HIF-PHIs may decrease hepcidin levels and modulate iron metabolism, thereby increasing total iron-binding capacity and reducing the need for iron supplementation. Furthermore, HIF-PHIs can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in CKD. Recombinant erythropoietin has become a routine treatment for patients with CKD and end-stage renal disease with relatively few adverse effects. However, higher doses of recombinant erythropoietin have been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients under hemodialysis. Phase III clinical trials of HIF-PHIs in patients with anemia and dialysis-dependent CKD have shown their efficacy and safety in both non-dialysis and dialysis CKD patients. However, HIFα binds to specific hypoxia-response elements in the vascular endothelial growth factor or retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) promoter, which may be involved in the progression of cancer, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. In this paper, we have summarized the mechanism, clinical application, and clinical trials of HIF-PHIs in the treatment of renal anemia and aimed to provide an overview of the new drugs in clinical practice, as well as reconsider the advantages and disadvantages of HIF-PHIs and ESAs.

METHODS: This study was conducted with 37 CERA-administered patients and 26 DA-administered patients who had initiated dialysis at a participating facility between January 2012 and December 2014. We investigated clinical laboratory data 3 months before and at dialysis initiation, and compared these data between the CERA and DA groups. RESULTS: No significant differences in hemoglobin level or reticulocyte count were found between the two groups 3 months before dialysis initiation. However, at dialysis initiation, the hemoglobin level (CERA 9.82 ± 1.52 vs. DA 8.79 ± 1.07 g/dL; P = 0.003) and the reticulocyte count (CERA 5.21 ± 2.95 vs. DA 3.15 ± 1.62 × 10(4)/μL; P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the CERA group than in the DA group.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROQOLID, and Cochrane Library/Renal Group Resources were searched. Studies were appraised for patient populations, disease-specific versus generic HRQL assessments, and type and magnitude of health-related costs. RESULTS: The treatment costs for CKD patients with anemia compared to those without anemia were significantly higher and were blunted but persistent after controlling for comorbidities and confounders. Intervention with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) decreased anemia and avoided hospital admissions. Costs were higher when anemia was poorly controlled or untreated. HRQL burden was mainly due to physical limitations and difficulty in ability to perform activities of daily living. Significant positive correlations between increases in hemoglobin levels and HRQL measures were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence is limited, the economic and HRQL burden of non-dialysis CKD-related anemia is substantial. Under-treatment of anemia may contribute to higher resource consumption and higher costs; however, patient co-morbidities, use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and overall management introduce potential confounds.

This study evaluated whether a switch from oral iron to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose can reduce ESA requirements and improve iron status and hemoglobin in patients with ND-CKD. METHODS: This prospective, single arm and single-center study included adult patients with ND-CKD (creatinine clearance ≤40 mL/min), hemoglobin 11-12 g/dL and iron deficiency (ferritin <100 μg/L or transferrin saturation <20%), who were regularly treated with oral iron and ESA during 6 months prior to inclusion. Study patients received an intravenous ferric carboxymaltose dose of 1,000 mg iron, followed by a 6-months ESA/ ferric carboxymaltose maintenance regimen (target: hemoglobin 12 g/dL, transferrin saturation >20%). Outcome measures were ESA dose requirements during the observation period after initial ferric carboxymaltose treatment (primary endpoint); number of hospitalizations and transfusions, renal function before and after ferric carboxymaltose administration, number of adverse reactions (secondary endpoints). Hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured monthly from baseline until end of study. Creatinine clearance, proteinuria, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase bimonthly from baseline until end of study. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled (age 70.1±11.4 years; mean±SD). Mean ESA consumption was significantly reduced by 83.2±10.9% (from 41,839±3,668 IU/patient to 6,879±4,271 IU/patient; p<0.01).

However, all of these abnormalities are closely inter-related and their individual effect on the development of anemia is uncertain. This study was aimed to assess the relationship between anemia and a set of metabolic bone disease biomarkers in a cohort of adult patients with advanced non-dialysis-dependent CKD. METHODS: The sample consisted of 382 patients submitted to a Nephrology Unit for evaluation of advanced CKD in a tertiary hospital from Gran Canaria during 3 years. Associations between anemia and serum levels of calcium (albumin-corrected), phosphorus, PTH, 25-hydroxivitamin D (25(OH)D3) and alkaline phosphatase were analyzed by using logistic regression models with adjustment for other demographic, clinical and biochemical covariates potentially related to anemia and to bone mineral metabolism. RESULTS: Serum levels of calcium and 25(OH)D3 (negatively) and phosphorus (positively) were significantly associated with anemia in an unadjusted logistic regression model. In a fully adjusted multivariable model, the OR for anemia was 0.29 (95% CI 0.16-0.49; p < 0.0001) for every 1 mg/dl increase in serum calcium and 2.19 (95% CI 1.55-3.15; p < 0.001) for every 1 mg/dl increase in serum phosphorus. Female sex and lower serum albumin levels were also independently associated with anemia. The inclusion of albumin in the adjusted model displaced the significance of 25(OH)D3.

LI","Rawee P. et al.","Heavy metals are common in our environment, and all individuals are exposed to them to some extent. These toxic metals have several harmful effects on the body, including the kidney, which is a very sensitive organ. Indeed, heavy metal exposure has been linked to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression, which may be explained by the well-established nephrotoxic effects of these metals. In this hypothesis and narrative literature review, we will shed light on the potential role that another highly common problem in patients with CKD, iron deficiency, may play in the damaging effects of heavy metal exposure in this patient group. Iron deficiency has previously been linked with an increased uptake of heavy metals in the intestine due to the upregulation of iron receptors that also take up other metals. Furthermore, recent research suggests a role of iron deficiency in the retention of heavy metals in the kidney. Therefore, we hypothesize that iron deficiency plays a crucial role in the damaging effects of heavy metal exposure in patients with CKD and that iron supplementation might be a strategy to combat these detrimental processes.","2023","International journal of molecular sciences",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

AREAS COVERED: We searched PubMed for original articles, reviews, and editorials having as a topic anemia, CKD, hypoxia inducible factor, hepcidin, iron, and hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHI). HIF-PHI are a new class of small molecules activating HIF-alfa isoforms (the main mediators of the effects of hypoxia on the body). This causes the secretion of endogenous erythropoietin and increased iron availability. Differing from ESA, HIF-PHI are administered orally. Preliminary data from phase-II clinical studies have shown their efficacy and safety in the short term. EXPERT OPINION: HIF-PHI are a new promising class of drugs. The results of large, phase-III clinical studies are awaited to prove their efficacy and safety on cardiovascular events and cancer development in the long term. Their capability of penetrating the ESA market in the future will be influenced also by their selling price.

This Phase 3, randomized, open-label, 24-week study investigated the efficacy and safety of roxadustat in Japanese CKD patients with anemia on peritoneal dialysis (PD) who were previously treated or not treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients not previously receiving ESA (ESA-Naïve group) were randomized to roxadustat at a starting dose of 50 or 70 mg three times weekly; patients previously receiving ESA (ESA-Converted group) switched from ESA to roxadustat 70 or 100 mg three times weekly depending on the prior ESA dose. Outcomes included maintenance rate of average hemoglobin (Hb) level within 10-12 g/dL at weeks 18-24, cumulative response rate at end of treatment (Hb thresholds, 10.0 g/dL or 10.5 g/dL; Hb increase, ≥1.0 g/dL), and average Hb levels at weeks 18-24. Safety was assessed by occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Fifty-six patients were enrolled (ESA-Naïve, n = 13; ESA-Converted, n = 43). Maintenance rates (weeks 18-24) were 92.3% (95% CI: 64.0-99.8; ESA-Naïve) and 74.4% (95% CI: 58.8-86.5; ESA-Converted). Cumulative response rate was 100.0% in the ESA-Naïve group.

Evidence supports the use of angiotensin inhibitors for patients with heart failure. However, there is little evidence with which to assess the risk and benefits of this treatment in elderly patients with renal dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of angiotensin inhibitor reduction in patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease and anaemia. STUDY DESIGN: Open randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coruña (Spain). PATIENTS: Patients ≥ 50 years old, with heart failure, haemoglobin (Hb) < 12 mg/dl and creatinine clearance <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) admitted to hospital, in treatment with angiotensin inhibitors. Informed consent and Ethical Review Board approval were obtained. INTERVENTION: A 50% reduction of angiotensin inhibitor dose of the basal treatment on admission (n = 30) in the intervention group. Control group (n = 16) with the standard basal dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was difference in Hb (gr/dl), creatinine clearance (ml/min/1.73 m(2) ) and protein C (mg/dl) between admission and 1-3 months after discharge. Secondary outcome was survival at 6-12 months after discharge. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group experienced an improvement in Hb (10.62-11.47 g/dl), creatinine clearance (32.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2) to 42.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ), and a decrease in creatinine levels (1.98-1.68 mg/dl) and protein C (3.23 mg/dl to 1.37 mg/dl).

","Levin A.","The relationship between haemoglobin (Hb) level and survival in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is complex. This paper explores the physiological basis for the hypothesis that Hb level and survival are causally related in this patient group, and assesses the current state of knowledge from clinical studies. Issues related to the methodology and analysis of clinical studies limit the certainty with which conclusions regarding the direct relationship between Hb level and survival can be drawn. The data support the concepts that Hb level is associated with survival in patients both with and without CKD, that changes in Hb level are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and that CVD is prevalent in patients with CKD. Hb level is affected by nutritional status, inflammation, and the availability and effectiveness of human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy, as well as by the degree of kidney function. Thus, the complexity of the relationships between Hb level, CVD and survival in patients with CKD requires further study from both the mechanistic and the clinical perspective. Properly designed clinical trials with survival as an endpoint, as well as data from prospectively measured modifiers of Hb levels and other markers of CVD, are needed to determine the physiological and statistical interaction of these factors in clinical practice.","2002","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Dardim K. et al.","BACKGROUND: Minimal data are available regarding the prevalence and incidence of anemia among patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) in France. METHODS: This was a retrospective non-interventional study of patients with a record of NDD-CKD in the Echantillon Généraliste des Bénéficiaires (EGB) database between January 01, 2012, and December 31, 2017. The primary objective was to estimate the annual incidence and prevalence of anemia of NDD-CKD. Secondary objectives included description of the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with NDD-CKD-related anemia. An exploratory objective was to use machine learning to identify patients from the general population that might have NDD-CKD but without a recorded ICD-10 diagnosis of CKD. RESULTS: During 2012-2017, 9865 adult patients in the EGB database had confirmed NDD-CKD; of these, 49.1% (4848/9865) had anemia. From 2015 to 2017, estimates of incidence (108.7-114.7 per 1000 population) and prevalence (435.7-449.5 per 1000 population) of NDD-CKD-related anemia were stable. Less than half of patients with anemia of NDD-CKD were treated with oral iron, and approximately 15% were treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Based on adult French population projections in 2020 and an estimated prevalence rate in 2017 of 42.2 per 1000 population for confirmed plus possible NDD-CKD (as a proportion of the general French population), the estimated number of patients with possible NDD-CKD in France was 2,256,274, approximately five-fold greater than the number identified by diagnostic codes and hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia of NDD-CKD was shown to be a constant long-term burden in France, and its apparent prevalence may still be significantly underestimated.

Direct correlation between the concentration of hemoglobin and the stage of renal failure is well known. Early development of anemia is common in diabetic patients. Correction of anemia may slow the progression of CKD. Anemia is an independent risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.

LI","Packer M.","Renal anemia is treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), even though epoietin alfa and darbepoietin increase the risk of cardiovascular death and thromboembolic events, including stroke. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain (HIF-PHD) inhibitors have been developed as an alternative to ESAs, producing comparable increases in hemoglobin. However, in advanced chronic kidney disease, HIF-PHD inhibitors can increase the risk of cardiovascular death, heart failure and thrombotic events to a greater extent than that with ESAs, indicating that there is a compelling need for safer alternatives. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, and they increase hemoglobin, an effect that is related to an increase in erythropoietin and an expansion in red blood cell mass. SGLT2 inhibitors increase hemoglobin by ≈0.6-0.7 g/dl, resulting in the alleviation of anemia in many patients. The magnitude of this effect is comparable to that seen with low-to-medium doses of HIF-PHD inhibitors, and it is apparent even in advanced chronic kidney disease. Interestingly, HIF-PHD inhibitors act by interfering with the prolyl hydroxylases that degrade both HIF-1α and HIF-2α, thus enhancing both isoforms. However, HIF-2α is the physiological stimulus to the production of erythropoietin, and upregulation of HIF-1α may be an unnecessary ancillary property of HIF-PHD inhibitors, which may have adverse cardiac and vascular consequences. In contrast, SGLT2 inhibitors act to selectively increase HIF-2α, while down-regulating HIF-1α, a distinctive profile that may contribute to their cardiorenal benefits. Intriguingly, for both HIF-PHD and SGLT2 inhibitors, the liver is likely to be an important site of increased erythropoietin production, recapitulating the fetal phenotype. These observations suggest that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors should be seriously evaluated as a therapeutic approach to the treat of renal anemia, yielding less cardiovascular risk than other therapeutic options.","2023","American journal of nephrology",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Health economic evidence is important in Malaysia and yet cost and quality-of-life (QOL) data are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To investigate prevalence, factors associated with anemia, and cost and QOL among T2DM patients with CKD. Here, we present the estimated 1-year cost and QOL related to anemia in this group. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was performed at 20 government clinics. Treatment cost was calculated on the basis of resource utilization ascertained through data extracted from medical records and patient recall. QOL was elicited using the short form 36 health survey version 2 questionnaire. Propensity score matching was performed and costs and QOL were analyzed by anemia status and CKD stage. RESULTS: Data for 816 patients were obtained. The propensity score matching enabled a comparison of 257 patients with and without anemia. Annual treatment costs were significantly higher for patients with anemia (Ringgit Malaysia [RM] 4219 [US $983] vs. RM2705 [US $630]; P = 0.01).

","Fox K. et al.","BACKGROUND: Transfusion patterns are not well characterized in non-dialysis (ND) chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This study describes the proportion of patients transfused, units of blood transfused and trigger-hemoglobin (Hb) levels for transfusions in severe anemic, ND-CKD patients in routine practice. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of electronic medical record data from the Henry Ford Health System identified 374 adult, ND-CKD patients with severe anemia (Hb < 10 g/dL and subsequent use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [ESA] therapy, blood transfusions, or a second Hb < 10 g/dL) between January 2004 and June 2008. Exclusions included those with prior diagnoses of cancer, renal or liver transplant, end-stage renal disease, acute bleeding, trauma, sickle cell disease, or aplastic anemia. A gap of ≥ 1 days between units of blood transfused was counted as a separate transfusion. RESULTS: At least 1 transfusion (mean of 2 units; range, 1-4) was administered to 20% (75/374) of ND-CKD patients with mean (± SD) follow-up of 459 (± 427) days. The mean (± SD) Hb level closest and prior to a transfusion was 8.8 (± 1.5) g/dL. Patients who were hospitalized in the 6 months prior to their first anemia diagnosis were 6.3 times more likely to receive a blood transfusion than patients who were not hospitalized (p < 0.0001). Patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were twice as likely to have a transfusion as patients without PVD (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Transfusions were prevalent and the trigger hemoglobin concentration was approximately 9 g/dL among ND-CKD patients with anemia. To reduce the transfusion burden, clinicians should consider other anemia treatments including ESA therapy.","2012","BMC nephrology",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

BACKGROUND: Guidelines focus on early identification and management of CKD to prevent CKD progression and cardiovascular disease. However, the significance of CKD classification using eGFR in older people is unclear. METHODS: Serum creatinine and haemoglobin from individuals attending non-nephrology outpatient clinics were extracted from the state pathology provider over a 4-month period. The associations between eGFR, gender, age and haemoglobin were explored. RESULTS: Serum creatinine in 9853 individual patients aged > or =15 years was available for analysis. Haemoglobin was simultaneously available in 8752 (88.8%) subjects. There was a negative relationship between age and median eGFR, and the slope of the regression line was -0.68 ml/min/year for males and -0.74 ml/min/year for females. Over 35% of individuals > or =65 years were classified as having CKD stage > or =3. Odds ratios for haemoglobin <100 g/l for an eGFR <15, 15-29 and 30-59 versus reference GFR > or =60 ml/ min/1.73 m(2) in subjects 25-44 years were 34.2 (30.7-37.7), 23.4 (20.2-26.6) and 7.2 (5.3-9.1), respectively.

","Toft G. et al.","BACKGROUND: Routine clinical evidence is limited on clinical outcomes associated with anemia in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: We linked population-based medical databases to identify individuals with severe CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) in Northern Denmark from 2000 to 2016, including prevalent patients as of 1 January 2009 or incident patients hereafter into the study. We classified patients as non-anemic (≥ 12/≥ 13 g/dl hemoglobin (Hgb) in women/men), anemia grade 1 (10-12/13 g/dl Hgb in women/men), 2 (8-10 g/dl Hgb), and 3+ (< 8 g/dl Hgb), allowing persons to contribute with patient profiles and risk time in consecutively more severe anemia grade cohorts. Patients were stratified by dialysis status and followed for clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 16,972 CKD patients contributing with a total of 28,510 anemia patient profiles, of which 3594 had dialysis dependent (DD) and 24,916 had non-dialysis dependent (NDD) severe CKD. Overall, 14% had no anemia, 35% grade 1 anemia, 44% grade 2 anemia and 17% grade 3+ anemia. Compared to patients with no anemia, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for NDD patients with grade 3+ anemia were elevated for incident dialysis (1.91, 95% CI 1.61-2.26), any acute hospitalization (1.74, 95% CI 1.57-1.93), all-cause death (1.82, 95% CI 1.70-1.94), and MACE (1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.26).

Anemia has been associated with progressive loss of kidney function and increased mortality. Ferric citrate was recently developed, primarily as a novel oral, non-calcium phosphate binder, which has also shown to replenish the iron deficient state of the CKD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study was done on 40 pre-dialysis adult patients of CKD (stage 3-5) from a tertiary care centre in North India. Patients on intravenous iron, erythropoietin stimulating agents or other phosphate binders were excluded from the study. All the patients were given tablet ferric citrate (each tablet containing ferric citrate 1.1 gm equivalent to ferric iron 210 mg) in a dose of 3 tablets per day for three months. Patients were followed up at two weekly intervals and relevant investigations were done. They were divided into three groups according to their CKD stages for subgroup analysis. OBSERVATIONS: After three months of therapy with ferric citrate there was a significant decrease in mean serum phosphate from 6.55±0.70 mg/dl at baseline to 4.36±0.50 mg/dl at the end of three months (p<0.001). Mean hemoglobin increased from 7.92±1.05 g/dl at baseline to 10.96±1.04 g/dl at the end of three months (p<0.001). Serum ferritin and serum transferrin saturation increased from 278.25±110.56 ng/dl, 25.02±4.03 % at baseline to 401.24±152.47 ng/dl and 29.62±3.77 % at the end of three months. The mean serum vitamin D and serum iPTH levels, at baseline and at the end of 3 months were 14.61±10.80 ng/ml, 509.48±210.75 pg/ml and 23.65±14.00 ng/ml, 424.14±173.18 pg/ml respectively. The change in all these parameters were significant irrespective of the CKD stages.

Investigational drugs that target the HIF-PH pathway are promising alternatives for treating anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes recent advances focused on the clinical development of HIF-PH inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) as potentially novel therapies in the treatment of anemia in CKD based on publications available on PubMed and restricted Google searches. We provide a comparison between HIF-PHIs regarding their pharmacokinetics, dosing regimens and safety concerns, structure-activity relationships, and alterations in key laboratory parameters observed in animal models and clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: HIF-PHIs may be advantageous in some aspects compared to the conventional erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). While ESAs could increase the risk of cardiovascular events due to rapid rises in ESA blood levels, HIF-PHIs have been reported to maintain EPO concentrations at levels that are closer to the normal physiological ranges. Although HIF-PHIs have been demonstrated to be relatively safe and effective in clinical trials, long-term safety data are needed in order to establish whether these therapeutic agents will lead to a major paradigm change in the treatment of anemia of CKD.","2020","Expert opinion on investigational drugs",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Most recently, the TREAT (Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy) study of anemic type 2 diabetic patients with CKD reported that treatment with darbepoetin conferred no benefit in mortality or in attenuating cardiovascular or renal events. Instead, there was a twofold higher rate of stroke and thromboembolic complications and a higher rate of cancer deaths in patients randomized to treatment with darbepoetin. Furthermore, there was an inconsistent and modest improvement in health-related quality of life.

","Khan M. and Elderdery A.","BACKGROUND: Anemia results from low kidney production of the erythropoiesis-stimulant erythropoietin. Good liver function is crucial to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study analyzed two hematological parameters (hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Ht)) and two liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: Three hundred and thirty individuals participated in this study. Of them, 159 patients with CKD undergoing HD and 171 healthy individuals as a control group were recruited between January and October 2017. Blood was collected into EDTA containers for complete blood count (CBC) and into additive plain containers for ALT and AST. Relevant case history data were also taken. RESULTS: Obtained results for first and second month of Hb, Ht, AST and ALT of CKD patients undergoing HD were lower (10.2 g/dL and 8.9 for Hb; 27.2% and 24.8% for Ht; 17.8 IU/L and 15.6 IU/L for ALT; 13.9 IU/L and 12.0 IU/L for AST, respectively) (P < 0.05) compared to healthy individuals (15.1 g/dL for Hb; 44.6% for Ht; 28.3 IU/L for ALT and 23.0 IU/L for AST). Furthermore, Hb, Ht, AST and ALT levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in their second month compared to the first month. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia might emerge in CKD patients because of low Hb concentration and consequent low Ht. Advanced stage CKD causes decreased AST and ALT, as a result of lipid metabolism disturbances. Therefore, anemia and liver diseases are recommended to be treated in CKD patients to alleviate related complications. Renal transplantation must be performed earlier for them to avoid further complications.","2018","Journal of hematology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey data from Chinese physicians and their CKD patients were collected in 2015. Physicians recorded demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment. Patients completed the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. Data were stratified by dialysis-dependence, hemoglobin (Hb) level, and anemia treatment. RESULTS: Based on data from 1,052 patients (704 non-dialysis-dependent [NDD] and 348 dialysis-dependent [DD] patients), prescribed anemia treatment differed significantly across Hb levels (P < 0.001). In NDD patients, anemia treatment also differed significantly by on-treatment Hb level (P < 0.001). In treated NDD patients with Hb < 10 g/ dL, Hb 10 to 12 g/dL, and Hb > 12 g/dL, 31%, 59%, and 38% of patients, respectively, were prescribed oral iron, and 34%, 19%, and 0% of patients, respectively, were prescribed oral iron with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). NDD patients were less likely to be prescribed any anemia treatment, and ESA specifically, than DD patients. When treated, 67% and 45% of NDD and DD patients, respectively, had Hb ≥ 10 g/dL (P < 0.001). Overall work and activity impairment differed significantly across Hb levels in NDD and DD patients, with the least impairment observed at the highest Hb level. CONCLUSION: Approximately 40% of NDD patients and 60% of DD patients receiving anemia treatment had Hb < 10 g/dL.

Few studies of anemia treatment in an incident dialysis (ID) population have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of daprodustat vs darbepoetin alfa in treating anemia of chronic kidney disease in ID patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial was conducted from May 11, 2017, through September 24, 2020, in 90 centers across 14 countries. Patients with advanced CKD were eligible if they planned to start dialysis within 6 weeks from screening or had started and received hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) within 90 days before randomization, had a screening hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 8.0 to 10.5 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and a randomization Hb of 8.0 to 11.0 g/dL, were ESA-naive or had received limited ESA treatment, and were iron-replete. INTERVENTIONS: Randomized 1:1 to daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary analysis in the intent-to-treat population evaluated the mean change in Hb concentration from baseline to evaluation period (weeks 28-52) to assess noninferiority of daprodustat vs darbepoetin alfa (noninferiority margin, -0.75 g/dL). The mean monthly intravenous (IV) iron dose from baseline to week 52 was the principal secondary end point. Rates of treatment-emergent and serious adverse events (AEs) were also compared between treatment groups to assess safety and tolerability. RESULTS: A total of 312 patients (median [IQR] age, 55 [45-65] years; 194 [62%] male) were randomized to either daprodustat (157 patients; median [IQR] age, 52.0 [45-63] years; 96 [61%] male) or darbepoetin alfa (155 patients; median [IQR] age, 56.0 [45-67] years; 98 [63%] male); 306 patients (98%) completed the trial. The mean (SD) Hb concentration during the evaluation period was 10.5 (1.0) g/dL for the daprodustat and 10.6 (0.9) g/dL for the darbepoetin alfa group, with an adjusted mean treatment difference of -0.10 g/dL (95% CI, -0.34 to 0.14 g/dL), indicating noninferiority. There was a reduction in mean monthly IV iron use from baseline to week 52 in both treatment groups; however, daprodustat was not superior compared with darbepoetin alfa in reducing monthly IV iron use (adjusted mean treatment difference, 19.4 mg [95% CI, -11.0 to 49.9 mg]). Adverse event rates were 76% for daprodustat vs 72% for darbepoetin alfa.

Although extended dosing with darbepoetin alfa, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), has been shown to be effective in maintaining haemoglobin (Hb) levels in CKD patients, little information is published on the use of darbepoetin alfa in the correction and maintenance of Hb levels in elderly CKD patients naive to ESA therapy. OBJECTIVE: This post hoc subanalysis of data from two clinical trials was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of de novo every-other-week (q2w) darbepoetin alfa in elderly patients with CKD-associated anaemia (not on dialysis), as compared with that of a younger (aged <65 years) patient cohort. METHODS: This analysis was based on data obtained from two open-label, single-arm, multicentre studies of similar design. Patients were aged >or=18 years and naive to previous ESA therapy. Darbepoetin alfa administration was initiated at 0.75 microg/kg and titrated according to individual patient requirements to achieve and maintain Hb levels between 11.0 and 13.0 g/dL. The proportion of patients who achieved the primary endpoint, Hb >or=11.0 g/dL (study 1), and an Hb level between 11.0 and 13.0 g/dL (study 2) at weeks 4, 8 and 12 weeks and at the end of the study were determined. The results of this subanalysis were stratified by age (<65, 65-74 and >or=75 years). RESULTS: A total of 203 patients were enrolled in the two studies; 60% were female, 84 (41%) were aged <65 years, 57 (28%) were aged 65-74 years and 62 (31%) were aged >or=75 years. The proportion of patients who achieved Hb levels of >or=11.0 g/dL in study 1 and 11.0-13.0 g/dL in study 2 at week 20 were 93%, 96% and 92%, respectively, for the three age groups. Weight-adjusted q2w darbepoetin alfa doses were similar between the age groups and stable throughout the study period. The mean (standard deviation) Hb levels at week 21 were 12.0 (1.2), 12.7 (1.1) and 12.6 (1.0) g/dL in subjects aged <65, 65-74 and >or=75 years, respectively.

The safety profiles of q2w darbepoetin alfa in both the older and younger age-groups were consistent with those expected for patients with CKD not receiving dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that ESA-naive subjects aged <65, 65-74 and >or=75 years of age with CKD (not receiving dialysis) who received q2w darbepoetin alfa were able to achieve and maintain Hb levels at 11.0-13.0 g/dL.

These changes are mediated by transient activation of the mechanosensory Piezo1 channel, resulting in calcium influx. Importantly, prolonged Piezo1 activation shortens RBC life span, presumably through activation of calcium-dependent intracellular pathways triggering RBC death. Two Piezo1-activating small molecules, Jedi1 and Jedi2, share remarkable structural similarities with 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF), a uremic retention solute cleared by the healthy kidney. We hypothesize that in CKD the accumulation of CMPF leads to prolonged activation of Piezo1 (similar in effect to Jedi1 and Jedi2), thus reducing RBC life span. This hypothesis can be tested through bench experiments and, ultimately, by studying the effect of CMPF removal on renal anemia.","2022","FASEB bioAdvances",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

,"19907148"," The anemia of heart failure. ","Silverberg D. et al.","Anemia is common in congestive heart failure (CHF) and is associated with an increased mortality and morbidity. The most likely causes of anemia are chronic kidney disease (CKD) and excessive cytokine production, both of which can cause depression of erythropoietin (EPO) production and bone marrow activity. The cytokines also induce iron deficiency by both reducing gastrointestinal iron absorption and iron release from iron stores located in the macrophages and hepatocytes. Iron deficiency can cause thrombocytosis which might also contribute to cardiovascular complications in both CHF and CKD and is partially reversible with iron treatment. Thus attempts to control this anemia will have to consider both the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), such as EPO, as well as oral and, probably more importantly, intravenous (IV) iron. The many studies on anemia in CHF patients treated with ESA and oral or IV iron, and even with IV iron without ESA have up to now shown a quite consistent positive effect on hospitalization, fatigue, shortness of breath, quality of life, exercise capacity, and beta-natriuretic peptide reduction, in the absence of increased cardiovascular damage related to the therapy. Adequately powered long-term placebo-controlled studies of ESA and/or IV iron are currently being carried out and their results are eagerly awaited.","2009","Acta haematologica",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Of the 500 patients included in the main study, valid data were available for iron metabolism in n = 419 microg/dL; folic acid, n = 205 ng/mL; and vitamin B12, n = 210 pg/mL. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin </=13 g/dL (men) or </=12 g/dL (women) and/or use of erythropoietin (EPO). Anemic patients (59.4%) had less sideremia (73.4 vs 81.2 microg/dL; P = .008), but no significant differences were observed for transferrin saturation index (25.9% vs 25.5%), ferritin (167 vs 171 ng/mL), iron insufficiency (26.5% vs 36.2%), pronounced ferropenia (20.4% vs 20.1%), folic acid (7.5 vs 6.6 ng/mL), or vitamin B12 (486 vs 530 pg/mL). Treatment with oral or intravenous iron was much more frequent in anemic patients (31.6% vs 9.9%; P < .001). The logistic regression analysis of factors associated with anemia revealed that renal function and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were significant but not the degree of iron deficiency. In conclusion, iron deficiency in renal transplant patients with chronic nephropathy is frequent and insufficiently treated.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the hazard ratios of the study endpoints. Longitudinal data was analyzed using generalized estimating equation (GEE). RESULTS: The participants were followed for a median of 7.3 years. A high HGI predicted rapid renal function decline without or with a resultant eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), but not onset of macroalbuminuria. The longitudinal GEE model demonstrated a negative association between HGI and the predicted eGFR changes in both the 1-year and 3-year intervals.

Methods All patients having chronic kidney disease with anemia and prescribed Hetero-Darbepoetin were the target patient population. The present study gathered the data from 503 Hetero-Darbepoetin alfa prescribed patients. This study collected information of patient demography, patient's medical history, concomitant medications, action taken with respect to Hetero-Darbepoetin-alfa, adverse events details (AE term, start date, stop date, severity, action taken, outcome, and causality), periodic hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and abnormal laboratory tests results until treatment is discontinued or the patient is lost to follow-up. Immunogenicity data were collected in 121 patients at the end of treatment and after one year. Results Eighty-seven AEs were reported in this study and most of them were mild to moderate in intensity. No deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in this study. Anti-drug antibodies were not detected in any subject at the end of the treatment phase and after 12 months long-term follow-up period. The baseline mean hemoglobin value was 8.34 (SD 1.24) g/dL and the last visit mean hemoglobin value was 10.42 ± 1.24 (mean ± SD) g/dL. The mean difference between baseline and last visit in hemoglobin value was 2.10 [2.00, 2.20], statistically significant (p-value <0.0001). Conclusions The safety and tolerability of the usage of DA-α are similar to that reported in the published literature of the innovator. No patients showed anti-drug antibodies after treatment.

","Dignass A. et al.","Patients with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high rates of iron deficiency with adverse clinical consequences. Under normal circumstances, serum ferritin levels are a sensitive marker for iron status but ferritin is an acute-phase reactant that becomes elevated in response to inflammation, complicating the diagnosis. Proinflammatory cytokines also trigger an increase in hepcidin, which restricts uptake of dietary iron and promotes sequestration of iron by ferritin within storage sites. Patients with inflammatory conditions may thus have restricted availability of iron for erythropoiesis and other cell functions due to increased hepcidin expression, despite normal or high levels of serum ferritin. The standard threshold for iron deficiency (<30 μg/L) therefore does not apply and transferrin saturation (TSAT), a marker of iron availability, should also be assessed. A serum ferritin threshold of <100 μg/L or TSAT < 20% can be considered diagnostic for iron deficiency in CHF, CKD, and IBD. If serum ferritin is 100-300 μg/L, TSAT < 20% is required to confirm iron deficiency. Routine surveillance of serum ferritin and TSAT in these at-risk groups is advisable so that iron deficiency can be detected and managed.","2018","International journal of chronic diseases",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Knight T. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, decreased quality of life, and substantial health care costs. Iron therapy is recommended, usually in combination with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), in many CKD patients with anemia and low iron levels to raise hemoglobin levels to a range of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter; iron deficiency is defined by a ferritin score less than 100 micrograms (mcg) per liter and transferrin saturation (TSAT) less than 20%. OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of intravenous (IV) iron and its associated economic and clinical outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with stage 3 or stage 4 CKD and anemia. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis using 2006 and 2007 Medicare 5% Standard Analytic Files (SAF). Use of therapy with IV iron and/or ESAs was identified among patients diagnosed with CKD and anemia. The study index quarter was the first quarter in 2006 during which the patient had primary or secondary diagnoses of both CKD and anemia. Based on the receipt of IV iron or ESA treatment in the index quarter, patients were classified into 1 of 4 treatment groups: IV iron and ESA; IV iron without ESA; ESA without IV iron; neither IV iron nor ESA. Therapy with oral iron was not measurable with this database. Clinical and economic outcomes, including the progression to advanced CKD stages, development of anemia, mortality, hospitalization, and net Medicare reimbursement (i.e., not including patient or supplemental plan contribution) for all-cause health care services, were examined for 1 year following the index quarter. Between-group differences were tested using Pearson chi-square for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test for reimbursement. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to assess the associations of mortality, inpatient hospitalization, skilled nursing facility (SNF) admission, and hospice care with treatment regimen, controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 4,310 study patients with both CKD and anemia, 2,913 (67.6%) received neither IV iron nor ESA; 984 (22.8%) received ESA without IV iron; 277 (6.4%) received IV iron and ESA; and 136 (3.2%) received IV iron without ESA in the index quarter. Logistic regression analyses showed that patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA (reference group) were at increased risk of death compared with patients receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.42-0.90). Additionally, patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA were more likely to be hospitalized compared with patients receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50-0.87), IV iron without ESA (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38-0.79), and ESA without IV iron (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.62-0.87). Further, patients not receiving IV iron or ESA were more likely to be admitted to an SNF than patients receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.32-0.61), IV iron without ESA (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.36-0.88), and ESA without IV iron (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.47-0.67). Patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA in the index quarter had the highest mean [SD] total Medicare reimbursement per patient in the subsequent year ($42,353 [$52,887]) compared with patients receiving IV iron without ESA ($28,654 [$32,068]), IV iron and ESA ($34,152 [$30,506]), or ESA without IV iron ($38,172 [$35,591], P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use rates of IV iron and ESA in a sample of Medicare enrollees with CKD and anemia in 2006 suggest that anemia management therapies may be underutilized; however, oral iron therapy use was not measurable with the study database, and therapies initiated after the index quarter were not measured. Patients not treated with IV iron or ESA had significantly higher rates of hospitalization and SNF admission than patients treated with either IV iron or ESA. Further, mortality was significantly higher in patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA than in patients who received IV iron and ESA. Additionally, total all-cause health care costs were higher among patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA treatment compared with patients treated with IV iron and/or ESA.","2010","Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP"," OBJECTIVE : To examine the use of intravenous ( IV ) iron and its associated economic and clinical outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with stage 3 or stage 4 CKD and anemia ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Chong S. et al.","Background: Many studies demonstrated that roxadustat (FG-4592) could increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels effectively in anemia patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, its safety remains controversial. This study aims to explore the risk of infection for CKD patients treated with roxadustat, especially focused on sepsis. Methods: We thoroughly searched for the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment with roxadustat versus erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) or placebo in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials Register. Both on and not on dialysis anemia patients with CKD were included. Primary outcomes contained the incidence rates of sepsis. Secondary outcomes included infection-related consequences (septic shock and other infection events), general safety outcomes [all-cause mortality, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs)] and iron parameters. Moreover, a trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to assess if the results were supposed to be a robust conclusion. Results: Eighteen RCTs (n = 11,305) were included. Overall, the incidence of sepsis (RR: 2.42, 95% CI [1.50, 3.89], p = 0.0003) and cellulitis (RR: 2.07, 95% CI [1.24, 3.44], p = 0.005) were increased in the roxadustat group compared with placebo group. In non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD patients, the incidence of cellulitis (RR 2.01, 95% CI [1.23, 3.28], p = 0.005) was significantly higher in roxadustat group than that in the ESAs or placebo group. Both groups showed similar results in the incidence of septic shock (RR 1.29, 95% CI [0.86, 1.94], p = 0.22). A significant increased risk of all-cause mortality [risk ratios (RR): 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.05, 1.26], p = 0.002] was found in roxadustat treatment, and TSA confirmed the result. Compared with ESAs or placebo, both the incident rates of TEAEs (RR:1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.04], p = 0.008) and TESAEs (RR: 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.11], p = 0.002) were significantly increased in roxadustat group. As for iron parameters, changes from baseline (Δ) of hepcidin (MD: -26.46, 95% CI [-39.83, -13.09], p = 0.0001), Δ ferritin and Δ TSAT were remarkably lower in the roxadustat group, while Δ Hb, Δ iron and Δ TIBC increased significantly versus those in ESAs or placebo group. Conclusion: We found evidence that incidence rates of sepsis and cellulitis are higher in roxadustat group compared with placebo. This may be the result of improved iron homeostasis. The risk of all-cause mortality, TEAEs and TESAEs in CKD patients also increased in patients treated with roxadustat.

We also observed a significant decrease of hemoglobin level in the higher FGF23 group who had a diabetes history. High FGF23 levels were observed to be associated with low hemoglobin levels, which may be partially mediated through the effects of serum aldosterone levels in our patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.

","Hamada Y. et al.","BACKGROUND: Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) is a definitive treatment for anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). During long-term rHuEpo treatment most patients develop and show persistent iron deficiency in spite of oral iron supplementation. Abnormalities of iron absorption and transport in the duodenum may contribute to this deficiency. METHODS: To investigate changes in iron absorption and transport in CKD and iron deficiency against the background of rHuEpo treatment, we used severely anaemic rats with adenine-induced renal failure (adenine rats) and sham-treated control rats given only the vehicle. After 4 weeks on adenine or the vehicle, the rats were divided into four groups according to whether or not they received rHuEpo for the next 4 weeks: rHuEpo(-)-adenine, rHuEpo(-)-control, rHuEpo(+)-adenine and rHuEpo(+)-control. We evaluated the effects of rHuEpo treatment on iron balance, duodenal mRNA expression of molecules related to iron absorption and transport and hepatic mRNA expression of hepcidin. RESULTS: Treatment with rHuEpo improved anaemia and induced iron deficiency only in the adenine rats, in whom the expression of mRNAs for ferroportin 1 and hephaestin 1 increased and for divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) was unchanged. In contrast, control rats treated with rHuEpo showed no changes. Hepcidin mRNA expression was greater in adenine rats than in control rats. CONCLUSIONS: In the adenine rats, rHuEpo treatment improved renal anaemia and induced persistent iron deficiency. An alteration of mRNA expression of molecules related to iron metabolism in renal insufficiency may be one of the reasons for this iron deficiency.","2008","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association"," To investigate changes in iron absorption and transport in CKD and iron deficiency against the background of rHuEpo treatment , we used severely anaemic rats with adenine-induced renal failure ( adenine rats ) and sham-treated control rats given only the vehicle ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The current analysis evaluated the impact of anemia on HRQoL and work productivity in patients with non-dialysis dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD using real-world data. METHODS: Data were collected in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, the USA and China in 2012-2018 in the Adelphi Real World Disease Specific Programme™ for CKD, a large, cross-sectional, survey of physicians and their patients. Patients completed three patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments: the EuroQol 5-Dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3 L), the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) instrument and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. PROs were assessed by CKD stage and Hb levels, and regression analyses were performed with CKD stage and Hb level as independent variables and PROs as outcome variables, while adjusting for age, sex, CKD stage, comorbidities and cardiovascular risk. RESULTS: Overall, 5276 patients participated in the survey, including 28% stage 4 and 36% dialysis patients. Patients with lower Hb levels more often reported problems/issues on all EQ-5D-3 L domains (p < 0.0001). Regression analyses showed significant associations between lower Hb levels and the probability of low (< 0.8) EQ-5D-3 L utility scores (p < 0.0001) and low visual analog scale scores (p < 0.05), indicating poorer health status. Associations were seen even when adjusting for CKD stage and other potential confounding factors. Significant associations were observed between Hb level and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) Physical Component Summary, SF-12 Mental Component Summary and the three KDQOL-36 subscales (all p < 0.0001), and were confirmed using linear regression analyses adjusting for CKD stage and other potential confounders. Numerically greater work productivity losses and greater activity impairment were observed with lower Hb levels. CONCLUSIONS: Lower Hb levels worsen the impact of CKD on HRQoL, and are associated with lower work productivity in patients with CKD.

METHODS: 47,145 patients with prescription of antidiabetic agents >6 months in the outpatient visits (2003-2018) were linked to Taiwan's National Death Registry to identify all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Poisson assumption was used to estimate the mortality rates, and the Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate the relative hazards of respective mortality in relation to mean HbA1c in different statuses of anemia and CKD stages. RESULTS: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were the lowest in non-anemic stages 1-2 CKD patients, and the highest in anemic stages 3-5 CKD patients. In stages 1-2 CKD, excessive HRs observed in those with mean HbA1c <6.0% (Hazard Ratio [HR]) 1.58; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.18-2.12) became inconsequential after adjustment of medications and laboratory results (HR: 1.26; 95% CI 0.89-1.79). The similar patterns were observed in anemic stages 1-2 CKD, anemic or non-anemic stages 3-5 CKD. Low HbA1c was not related to cardiovascular mortality in any anemia status or CKD staging. CONCLUSIONS: Higher risks associated with low mean HbA1c and all-cause mortality were attenuated by adjustment of medications and comorbidities. It is imperative for the diabetologists to consider confounding effects of underlying illness before concluding low HbA1c associated higher mortality.","2022","PloS one"," We investigated rates and risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in association with mean HbA1c levels with stratification of anemia and chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stages , major causes of low HbA1c ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Ask about injectable and intravenous medications, radiotherapy, drugs that affect DNA synthesis (such as chemotherapeutic drugs), street drugs, herbal therapies, and vitamins. Be thorough when obtaining a medical and lifestyle history, especially as it relates to conditions that may affect erythropoiesis, for example, is the patient smoking? How much alcohol does he drink? Has he seen a Healthcare provider for any old or new problems recently? In addition, patients with CKD have many co-morbidities, which may include cancer. ESA therapy becomes much more complex in the patient with cancer and CKD, and therapy may necessitate a different approach and different Hgb targets.

We performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment with roxadustat versus placebo or epoetin alfa up to November 2019. We investigated the efficacy of roxadustat in the levels of hemoglobin and other clinical parameters in renal anemia in patients with NDD and DD-CKD. We estimated weighted-mean difference (WMD) using random effect models. We included six RCTs comprising 1001 patients of whom 70.6 % were treated with roxadustat and 294 controls. The control group for studies of NDD-CKD patients was placebo whereas an active control of epoetin-alfa was used in studies of DD-CKD patients. Median follow-up time was 8 weeks. All trials were industry-sponsored. Overall, roxadustat increased hemoglobin levels by 1.20 g/dl (95 % CI:0.66, 1.75,P < 0.0001,I(2) = 99.3 %). Hemoglobin levels increased by 1.99 g/dl in NDD-CKD patients versus placebo and 0.52 g/dl in DD-CKD patients versus epoetin-alfa. Roxadustat was associated with a decrease the levels of hepcidin by -49.3 ng/dl (-38.5 ng/dl in NDD patients versus placebo and -27.7 ng/dl in DD patients versus epoetin alfa), a decrease in ferritin of -49.7 μmol/l (-52.2 μmol/l in NDD patients versus placebo and -7.3 μmol/l in DD patients versus epoetin alfa), and increase in total iron-binding capacity of 32.2 μmol/l (14.1 μmol/l in NDD patients versus placebo and 13.6 μmol/l in DD patients versus epoetin alfa). The percentage change in the transferrin saturation levels was -2.07 % (-6%, NDD patients versus placebo, and +3.7 % in DD patients versus epoetin alfa) in anemia associated CKD patients.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of anemia management in CKD patients using Truven MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases was conducted. Monthly rates and types of anemia treatment for post-TREAT and post-FDA safety warning periods were compared to pre-TREAT period. Anemia management included ESA, intravenous iron, and blood transfusion. A time-series analysis using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model were used. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2015, CKD patients were increasingly less likely to be treated with ESAs, more likely to receive intravenous iron supplementation, and blood transfusions. The adjusted probabilities of prescribing ESAs were 31% (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67-0.71) and 59% (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.42) lower in the post-TREAT and post-FDA warning periods compared to pre-TREAT period. The probability of prescribing intravenous iron was increased in the post-FDA warning period (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19) although the increase was not statistically significant in the post-TREAT period (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.94-1.12). The probabilities of prescribing blood transfusion during the post-TREAT and post-FDA warning periods increased by 14% (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06-1.23) and 31% (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.22-1.39), respectively. Similar trends of prescribing ESAs and iron supplementations were observed in commercially insured CKD patients but the use of blood transfusions did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: After the 2011 FDA safety warnings, the use of ESA continued to decrease while the use of iron supplementation continued to increase. The use of blood transfusions increased significantly in Medicare patients while it remained stable in commercially insured patients.

Anemia was defined by a hemoglobin level < 10.5 g/dL. Hemodialysis patients received ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir/ombitasvir. KTx patients received sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. CKD patients with eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) received sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. Those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) received ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir/ombitasvir; 64 non-anemic patients also received ribavirin therapy. RESULTS: Mean age of CKDs was 49.1 years, 43.2 years for HDs, and 45.2 years for KTx patients. Most were male; body-mass index was ~ 23.8. Anemia did not affect the efficacy of DAAs in hemodialysis, CKD, or KTx patients. Most patients achieved a rapid virologic response (RVR), and a 12- and 24-week sustained viral response. Worsening of anemia among the non-anemic group was mostly related to ribavirin therapy in hemodialysis patients (11/16 patients). Acute kidney injury in CKDs occurred more frequently within the anemic group (59.5%) compared to the non-anemic group (32.1%). For KTx, graft impairment was more common among the anemic group (7/40) compared to the non-anemic group (2/85).

This Phase 2a study tested efficacy (Hb response) and safety of roxadustat in anemic nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) subjects. METHODS: NDD-CKD subjects with hemoglobin (Hb) ≤11.0 g/dL were sequentially enrolled into four dose cohorts and randomized to roxadustat or placebo two times weekly (BIW) or three times weekly (TIW) for 4 weeks, in an approximate roxadustat:placebo ratio of 3:1. Efficacy was assessed by (i) mean Hb change (ΔHb) from baseline (BL) and (ii) proportion of Hb responders (ΔHb ≥ 1.0 g/dL). Pharmacodynamic evaluation was performed in a subset of subjects. Safety was evaluated by adverse event frequency/severity. RESULTS: Of 116 subjects receiving treatment, 104 completed 4 weeks of dosing and 96 were evaluable for efficacy. BL characteristics for roxadustat and placebo groups were comparable. In roxadustat-treated subjects, Hb levels increased from BL in a dose-related manner in the 0.7, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg groups. Maximum ΔHb within the first 6 weeks was significantly higher in the 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg groups than in the placebo subjects. Hb responder rates were dose dependent and ranged from 30% in the 0.7 mg/kg BIW group to 100% in the 2.0 mg/kg BIW and TIW groups versus 13% in placebo.

,"32487538"," Nonclinical Characterization of the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitor Roxadustat, a Novel Treatment of Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease. ","Del B. et al.","Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a multifactorial disorder caused by impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production and altered iron homeostasis associated with inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that stimulates erythropoiesis via a coordinated response involving increased EPO production and enhanced iron availability for Hb synthesis. HIF degradation is regulated by HIF-prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) enzymes. We hypothesized that roxadustat, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of HIF-PH, would increase EPO production and promote erythropoiesis in animal models of anemia. In cells, roxadustat increased both HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins, leading to an increase in EPO production, even in the presence of EPO-suppressing inflammatory cytokines. Roxadustat administered intermittently to healthy rats and cynomolgus monkeys increased circulating EPO levels, reticulocytes, blood Hb, and hematocrit in a dose-dependent manner. Roxadustat corrected anemia in a rat model of CKD after five-sixth nephrectomy and in a rat model of anemia of inflammation with impaired iron metabolism induced by peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS). In the PG-PS model, roxadustat significantly decreased hepatic expression of hepcidin, a hormone responsible for iron sequestration and functional iron deficiency, and increased expression of two genes involved in duodenal iron absorption: divalent metal transporter 1 and duodenal cytochrome b. In conclusion, by activating the HIF pathway, roxadustat increased EPO production, elevated Hb, corrected anemia, and improved iron homeostasis. The coordinated erythropoietic response stimulated by roxadustat, involving both EPO production and mobilization of iron stores, makes this compound a promising treatment of anemia of CKD and anemia associated with functional iron deficiency. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Roxadustat is a novel orally available small-molecule inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes that reversibly stabilizes HIF-α, thus activating transcription of HIF-dependent genes, including EPO and regulators of iron homeostasis. Activation of the HIF pathway by roxadustat induces erythropoiesis in healthy rats and monkeys and corrects experimentally induced anemia in rats. The coordinated erythropoietic response that increases EPO production and mobilizes iron stores makes roxadustat a promising treatment for anemia of chronic kidney disease and anemia associated with functional iron deficiency.","2020","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

A control group (Group 2) consisted of 32 non-anemic patients matched for gender, age, and degree of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction. Along with iron exchange indicators, the time course of changes in serum Klotho levels were examined in all the 64 patients during screening and one year after the end of the study. For correction of anemia, 32 patients with this condition (Groups 1A and 1B) took short-acting epoetin (hypodermic recormon 2,000 IU thrice per week + iron (intravenous venofer 5 ml of 100 mg once per week)) under control of hemoglobin levels and serum transferrin iron and ferritin saturation. After achieving the target hemoglobin level of 110-120 g/l, for its keeping, all the patients received, instead of short-acting epoetin, long-acting hypodermic darbepoetin-α 1.5 µg once every 2 months and intravenous iron saccharate 100 mg once every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Among the 32 anemic patients in Group 1, 20 (63%) (Group 1 A) could achieve the target hemoglobin level (110--120 g/l) and maintain it within this range, by performing therapy with epoitin-β + iron saccharate; anemia (the hemoglobin level of <110 g/l) persisted in 12 (37%) patients (Group 1B) despite the fact that epoetin and iron saccharate had been administered. Group 1A was noted to have an increase in α-Klotho concentrations by an average of 100±11.6-pg/ml as compared to Group 1B (by only 72±4.2 pg/ml). At the same time, the α-Klotho levels in the control group by the end of the follow-up decreased by an average of 210±12.9 pg/ml as compared to the prescreening value. There was a direct correlation between hemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations and iron ferritin saturation percentage and α-Klotho levels. It was ascertained that the hemoglobin concentration of ≥110 g/l with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 75% could predict higher serum α-Klotho levels in CKD. The same patients were found to have an inverse relationship between the serum level of α-Klotho and the risk of cardiovascular events. CONCLUSION: The serum level of the protein Klotho is not only a marker for the severity of CKD and its complications (anemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure), but also a pathogenetic factor of CKD progression.

","Yi S. et al.","BACKGROUND: The impact of low-normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels and anemia on the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in general populations has rarely been examined. METHODS: 510,620 Korean adults aged 40-80 years without known chronic kidney disease (CKD) underwent health examinations during 2002-2003 and were followed-up until 2013. Incidence of ESRD was identified by hospital discharge and clinical visit records. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 10.5, 575 women and 1047 men were diagnosed with ESRD. Lower Hb levels were associated with an increased risk of ESRD at given severity of albuminuria and at given estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Hb 13-13.9 g/dL in men, Hb 11-11.9 g/dL in women, and trace albuminuria assessed by dipstick urinalysis were associated with more than doubled risk. The risk associated with lower Hb was stronger in older (≥60 years) than younger women. Among 349,993 participants with information on eGFR, the multivariable-adjusted HRs associated with 1 g/dL lower Hb in participants with eGFR values ≥60, 30-59, and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.17-1.54), 1.55 (1.38-1.74), and 1.75 (1.47-2.09), respectively (Pinteraction between eGFR groups = .06). CONCLUSIONS: Low-normal Hb levels and anemia are risk factors for ESRD incidence in person without CKD and for CKD progression to ESRD. Lower Hb increases the risk of ESRD through synergistic biological interactions with lower eGFR and albuminuria. The impacts of lower Hb may be stronger in older than younger women.

Patients with anemia and CKD exhibited more severe CAD (mean summed stress score 6.8 vs 4.7, p <0.01). Established high-risk findings were more prevalent in patients with anemia and/or CKD, including a summed stress score > or =8, transient ischemic dilation, or a left ventricular ejection fraction < or =40% (group 1 28%, group 2 38%, group 3 38%, group 4 48%, all p values <0.01). Patients with moderate CKD demonstrated an increased risk of an abnormal scan (odds ratio 2.66, p <0.0001). After adjustment in multivariate analysis, anemia and CKD each remained predictors for an abnormal scan. The association was stronger in those with the 2 conditions (odds ratio for high-risk scan 1.89, p = 0.0002). In conclusion, in patients with suspected CAD, anemia and CKD are predictors of myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic markers for worsened outcomes. The relation was independent of other risk factors, supporting the inclusion of anemia and CKD in global risk assessment for patients with suspected CAD.","2008","The American journal of cardiology"," We sought to ascertain whether coronary artery disease ( CAD ) by myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography is more common in patients with CKD ( glomerular filtration rate < or = 60 ml / min / 1","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kato K. et al.","BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) present high mortality and morbidity rates despite the availability of various therapies. Although CKD-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) and renal anemia are important factors in patients with CKD, only few studies have analyzed the relationship between them. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between CKD-MBD and anemia in patients with CKD who did not receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agent or iron therapies. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients with CKD aged ≥ 20 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories G2a to G5 who were referred to the Fuji City General Hospital between April 2018 and July 2019. The exclusion criterion was ongoing treatment for CKD-MBD and/or anemia. RESULTS: The data of 300 patients with CKD were analyzed in this study. The median age of patients was 71 (range, 56.5-79) years. The median eGFR was 34 (range, 20-48) mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the mean hemoglobin (Hb) level was 12.7 g/dL (standard deviation, 2.3), which decreased as the CKD stage increased. In a multivariate linear regression analysis of anemia-related factors, including age, renal function (eGFR), nutritional status, inflammation, and iron dynamics (serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin levels), the serum phosphate levels were significantly associated with the Hb levels (coefficient [95% confidence interval], -0.73 [-1.1, -0.35]; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed a robust association between serum phosphate levels and Hb levels in the low-ferritin (coefficient [95% confidence interval], -0.94 [-1.53, -0.35]; P = 0.002) and advanced CKD groups (coefficient [95% confidence interval], -0.89 [-1.37, -0.41]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between high serum phosphate levels and low Hb levels in patients with CKD not receiving treatment for anemia.

","Covic A. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Anemia is prevalent in the CKD population and worsens as kidney function declines, resulting in a diminished quality of life and increased morbidity/mortality. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine the real-world prevalence of CVD among patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), with and without comorbid anemia, and to assess the impact of these conditions on quality of life (QoL) and work productivity. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Adelphi CKD Disease-Specific Programme, conducted in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK (2012). Anonymized data were collected via patient record forms and patient-completed questionnaires. Patient data were stratified by anemic status and the presence of CVD comorbidity. RESULTS: Data were collected by physicians for 1993 patients, of whom 867 completed a patient-completed questionnaire. A total of 61.4% of patients had anemia, and the prevalence of anemia increased with CKD stage. Patients with anemia had a higher mean number of cardiovascular comorbidities than non-anemic patients (1.27 vs 0.95, respectively; P < 0.001). The presence of cardiovascular conditions was associated with a significantly reduced QoL (EuroQol EQ-5D-3L visual analog scale: coefficient, -5.68 in anemic patients; P = 0.028) and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI activity impairment: coefficient, +8.04 in anemic patients; P = 0.032), particularly among anemic patients.

","Tanaka S. et al.","BACKGROUND: Hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has been highlighted as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: We assessed cross-sectionally the prevalence, associated factors, and treatment status of anemia and ESA hyporesponsiveness in 4460 non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients enrolled in a multicenter cohort in Japan. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) level of less than 11 g/dL or receiving ESA therapy. ESA hyporesponsiveness was defined by the erythropoietin-resistance index (ERI), which was the erythropoietin dose per week divided by body weight and Hb level (U/kg/week/g/dl). RESULTS: Of the 4460 patients, 1050 (23.5%) had anemia. ESAs were administered to 626 patients, reaching a percentage of 57.5% of patients with stage G5 CKD. However, the ESA treatment rate was only 49.0% in patients with a hemoglobin level of < 11 g/dL. The proportion of patients receiving iron supplementation was lower than that of patients receiving ESAs regardless of CKD stage or hemoglobin level, and a significant proportion of patients did not receive iron supplementation, even those with iron deficiency. The ERI increased with CKD stage progression, and the multiple regression analysis showed that age, female sex, body mass index, cholesterol, glomerular filtration rate, and intact parathyroid hormone level were independent contributors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that many Japanese patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD receiving ESAs fail to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels. These results suggest the need for interventions for ESA hyporesponsiveness factors in addition to iron supplementation.","2022","Clinical and experimental nephrology",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This study aimed to investigate the effect of CKD and/or anemia on CVD mortality in a long-term cohort study involving Japanese community dwellers. We assessed 7,339 participants (aged ≥30 years) with no CVD history.

Clinical studies have shown that anemia is associated with reduced survival in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Furthermore, an association between anemia and adverse cardiovascular outcomes has also been observed in patients with earlier stages of CKD not yet requiring dialysis. Although this fact still remains controversial, high-efficiency on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) has been shown to improve anemia and to reduce the need for erythropoietin-stimulating agents in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This positive effect has been attributed to the fact that the convective methods might remove some protein-bound erythropoietic inhibitor substances. Moreover, in HD patients, renal anemia is linked to the inflammatory state of uremic syndrome. It is also worth nothing that the improvement in anemia is associated with a reduced inflammatory state in patients undergoing on-line HDF.

","Mata L. et al.","BACKGROUND: Treatment for anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) largely consists of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) with iron supplementation. Although ESAs are well-established and efficacious, their use has been associated with considerable economic and humanistic burdens. Roxadustat, an oral medication, is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that targets multiple causes of CKD and has a similar efficacy and safety profile to ESAs. The cost-effectiveness of this treatment, however, has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to develop a health economic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of roxadustat compared with ESAs for treating anemia of non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD. METHODS: A cohort-based model was developed for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients with anemia of NDD CKD, incorporating eight health states, representing the hemoglobin level of each patient. The model was informed by individual patient-level data from the roxadustat global phase 3 clinical trial program. Total and incremental costs as well as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with roxadustat versus ESAs were estimated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. Analyses exploring alternative scenarios were also conducted. RESULTS: On a per-person basis, over 1,000 simulations, roxadustat was found to be on average less costly (-£32) and more effective (+0.01 QALYs) than ESAs, with a dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The probability of cost-effectiveness at a £20,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold from the UK perspective was 67%. CONCLUSION: The model developed may be a useful instrument that, alongside expert clinical opinion, can inform clinical and policy decision-making regarding treatment of anemia of NDD CKD. The model highlights the cost-effectiveness of roxadustat, as well as its potential to have a meaningful impact in reducing the burden of anemia of NDD CKD.","2023","Journal of medical economics"," OBJECTIVE : The study objective was to develop a health economic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of roxadustat compared with ESAs for treating anemia of non-dialysis-dependent ( NDD ) CKD ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

There is growing interest about the role of iron supplementation in CKD, particularly ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), also in relation to the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Despite a greater knowledge on ID management in patients receiving haemodialysis, a paucity of data exists about peritoneal dialysis (PD). Furthermore, the aim of this paper is to provide the results of a nationwide Italian survey about ID in PD using the Delphi method. METHODS: A list of 16 statements (48 items) was developed about four main topics: (1) approach to iron therapy in PD; (2) management experience about iron therapy in PD; (3) ESA and iron in PD; (4) pharmacoeconomic impact. Using the Delphi methodology, the survey was distributed online to 36 Italian nephrologists with expertise in PD, who rated their level of agreement with each item on a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was predefined as more than 66% of the panel agreeing/disagreeing with any given statement. RESULTS: Twenty-five experts (70%) answered the survey. 35 items (73%) achieved a consensus (8 negative and 27 positive). In particular, the diagnosis of ID is widely known, but some doubts exist about how frequently test it. The use of I.V. iron seems to be routinary and can save money reducing the administration of ESAs. However, internal protocols are welcome. CONCLUSIONS: Expert PD nephrologists know well the problem of ID and feel the necessity of shared protocols to optimize the iron therapy and consequently the use of ESAs.","2022","BMC nephrology"," Furthermore , the aim of this paper is to provide the results of a nationwide Italian survey about ID in PD using the Delphi method ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The introduction of erythropoietin treatment has changed anemia management, but the therapeutic hemoglobin (Hb) target is still under debate, and clinical evidence for its effect on cardiac functions and QOL is sparse. METHODS: A 16-week dose-response study and a 32-week follow-Up study were combined. After correcting anemia of less than 10 g/dl in pre-dialysis Japanese CKD patients, a higher Hb target (12-13 g/dl) by darbepoetin alfa (DPO) was compared with the conventional Hb target by epoetin alfa (EPO). Outcomes were anemia correction, management of the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and QOL scores. RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in Hb at baseline and week 16, but a significant difference was recorded at week 34 (12.34 +/- 0.93 g/dl for DPO and 10.43 +/- 0.90 g/dl for EPO). In both groups, LVMI decreased similarly until week 16, but the decrease of EPO was retarded, and a significant difference between LVMI was seen only in DPO at week 34 (100.7 +/- 16.6 g/m(2) for DPO and 110.9 +/- 25.2 g/m(2) for EPO). Relationships between Hb and LVMI change at week 34 were examined by stratifying Hb into four groups (Hb <10 g/dl, 10 g/dl < or = Hb <11 g/dl, 11 g/dl < or = Hb <12 g/dl and 12 g/dl < or = Hb), and a decrease of LVMI was prominent in the 12 g/dl < or = Hb group. Correction of anemia to 11 g/dl or more led to improved QOL scores. No safety difference was observed among the treatments.

We therefore investigated the relationship between hemoglobin (Hb) levels at initiation of epoetin beta therapy and renal outcome in non-dialysis CKD patients with anemia. METHODS: In this prospective, multi-center, observational study, non-dialysis CKD patients with anemia who were naïve to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were divided into three groups based on their Hb levels at initiation of epoetin beta therapy (Group I: 10 ≤ Hb < 11 g/dL, Group II: 9 ≤ Hb < 10 g/dL, and Group III: Hb < 9 g/dL). The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of any renal event.

Risk of renal events was significantly higher in Group III compared with Group I (HR, 2.52; 95 % CI, 1.98-3.21; P < 0.0001); although not significant, the risk was also higher in Group II compared with Group I (HR, 1.48; 95 % CI, 0.91-2.40; P = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Initiation of ESA therapy when Hb levels decreased below 11 g/dL but not below 10 g/dL could be more effective at reducing the risk of renal events in non-dialysis CKD patients with anemia compared with initiation of ESA therapy at below 9 g/dL or even 10 g/dL.","2016","Clinical and experimental nephrology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Zhou Q. et al.","BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of roxadustat in treating anemia patients with dialysis-dependent (DD) chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: We comprehensively searched 5 databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating roxadustat for anemia in DD-CKD patients. RevMan 5.0 was used to extract and synthesize data for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten different RCTs (9 studies) and 5698 DD-CKD patients with anemia were included. Our findings revealed that when compared to the erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) group, the roxadustat group showed increased hemoglobin levels [MD (Mean Difference) 0.25 g/dL (95%CI 0.14 g/dL to 0.36 g/dL), p < 0.00001] and improved iron-utilization by increasing serum iron [MD 1.85 µmol/L], total iron binding capacity [MD 35.73 µg/dL], transferrin saturation [MD 1.19%], and transferrin level [MD 0.40 g/L]. In addition, we found that roxadustat significantly decreased the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [MD -0.39 mmol/L] and total cholesterol [MD -0.6 mmol/L]. In patients with a C-reactive protein level that exceeds the upper limit of the normal range, hemoglobin levels were higher for roxadustat than for ESAs [MD 0.39 g/dL]. Treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent serious adverse events, and major adverse cardiovascular events were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The hemoglobin levels of DD-CKD patients were significantly increased and not affected by the inflammatory state after roxadustat treatment. Roxadustat also improved iron utilization, and it was not associated with higher treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent serious adverse events, and major adverse cardiovascular events when compared to ESAs.","2023","Renal failure"," This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of roxadustat in treating anemia patients with dialysis-dependent ( DD ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ","Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kimel M. et al.","OBJECTIVES: Anemia, defined as having low levels of hemoglobin (HGB), is caused by disease-related (e.g., bone marrow suppression, nutritional deficiency) or treatment-related (e.g., chemotherapy, antiretroviral therapy) factors. Although epoetin alfa has been shown to improve HGB outcomes in cancer, HIV/AIDS, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), these results have been viewed in isolation, rather than across populations. The purpose of this article is to review findings from trials that evaluated the impact of epoetin alfa on HGB and health-related quality of life (HRQL) across various populations with different underlying causes of anemia. METHODS: A review of clinical trials published in English between January 1993 and September 2005. Searches were conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Between- and within-group changes in HGB and HRQL were examined. RESULTS: One hundred ten articles were retrieved and 18 were reviewed. Statistically significant improvements in HGB were generally seen (1) between groups for cancer patients receiving epoetin alfa compared with those receiving placebo or standard of care (SOC) (between-group differences in changes from baseline to end point ranging from 1.2 to 1.9 g/dl); and (2) within groups for HIV/AIDS and CKD patients receiving epoetin alfa (changes from baseline to end point of 2.5 and 2.9 g/dl and 2.7 g/dl, respectively). Statistically and clinically significant improvements in HRQL, particularly with regard to fatigue, were seen across chronic conditions based on the Linear Analog Scale Assessment energy scale; where improvements of at least 8 mm-considered clinically relevant-were generally seen (1) between groups for cancer patients receiving epoetin alfa compared with those receiving placebo or SOC (differences in changes from baseline to end point from 0.8 to 19.8 mm); and (2) within groups for HIV/AIDS and CKD patients receiving epoetin alfa (changes from baseline to end point of 23 and 25 mm and 28 mm, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Results of published clinical trials suggest that treatment of anemia associated with cancer, HIV/AIDS and CKD can have a significant impact on HRQL, particularly fatigue, and that this impact is both statistically and clinically significant.","2008","Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research"," OBJECTIVES : Anemia , defined as having low levels of hemoglobin ( HGB ) , is caused by disease-related ( e","Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of albumin dan hemoglobin levels on the hospitalization incidence of patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease who undergo chronic hemodialysis. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with end stage kidney disease who underwent regular hemodialysis at the Prof. dr. R. D Kandou Hospital, Manado, Indonesia. Patients with malignancy were excluded. We measured the hemoglobin and albumin baseline level and observed the hospitalization incidence over the next 6 months. We used the Chi Square test with significance level of p-value 0.05, to analyze the association between both anemia and hypoalbuminemia with risk of hospitalization over 6 months of follow up period. RESULTS: We enrolled 202 patients as our participants, most of whom were men (61.8%), with a mean age of 60.21±9.32 years. There were 120 participants (59.4%) being hospitalized during 6-months-follow-up period. The mean level of albumin was 3.29±0.63 g/dl, while the mean hemoglobin level was 9.43±1.75 g/dl.

","Barratt J. et al.","INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to elucidate the safety of roxadustat, an oral medication, in patients with non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) or incident dialysis dialysis-dependent (ID-DD) chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Safety results from four phase 3, randomized, open-label studies comparing roxadustat to an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) in men and women with NDD or ID-DD CKD with anemia were pooled and evaluated. Endpoints were time to major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality) and MACE+ (MACE plus congestive heart failure or unstable angina requiring hospitalization), all-cause mortality, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). MACE and MACE+ were evaluated for non-inferiority at 1.8- and 1.3-margins using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). TEAEs were descriptively summarized. RESULTS: In total, 2142 patients were evaluated (1083 roxadustat; 1059 ESA). Roxadustat was comparable to ESA for risk of MACE (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02), MACE+ (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57-1.05). TEAEs were comparable between roxadustat and ESA groups, including any TEAE [incidence rate per 100 (IR/100) patient-exposure years 56.1 vs. 53.5], TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation (IR/100 patient-exposure years 6.7 vs. 5.1), and TEAEs leading to death (IR/100 patient-exposure years 6.9 vs. 7.4). CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events or mortality with roxadustat compared with ESA in patients with anemia who have NDD or ID-DD CKD. Although TEAEs occurred commonly in both the roxadustat and ESA groups, patients infrequently discontinued the study drug because of an adverse event.

However, limited information exists regarding the development and prognostic impact of HAA associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in AMI patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 2,289 patients with AMI, and excluded those with anemia at admission. The study population included 1,368 patients, of whom 800 (58.5%) developed HAA. Age, Hgb level at admission, Length of hospital stay, documented in-hospital bleeding and use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, presence of CKD and occurrence of AKI were significantly associated with the development of HAA. HAA was significantly associated with higher 3-year mortality (4.8% and 11.4% for non-HAA and HAA patients, respectively; P < 0.001). After adjustment for multivariable confounders, the risk for long-term mortality was increased in HAA patients with AKI and/or CKD but not in HAA patients without AKI and/or CKD, compared to non-HAA patients (HAA patients without AKI and CKD, hazard ratio [HR]: 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-2.56; HAA patients with either AKI or CKD, HR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.37-5.73; HAA patients with AKI and CKD, HR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.28-8.24; compared with the non-HAA group). CONCLUSION: AKI and CKD were strongly associated with the development of HAA in AMI patients.

Although high hemoglobin (Hb) is detrimental to CKD patients, its relationship with poor outcomes in the COPD population has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between high Hb and in-hospital mortality and to explore reference Hb intervals in patients with COPD and CKD. METHODS: This retrospective study was multicenter population-based. A total of 47,209 patients who presented with COPD between January 2012 and December 2016 were included. The average Hb level during hospitalization was used as the Hb level. CKD and advanced CKD were defined as estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 and < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. The association between Hb level (measured in 1 g/dL intervals) and in-hospital mortality was analyzed in different multivariable logistic regression models by CKD stratification. RESULTS: The Hb level was decreased in the CKD subgroup. In the non-CKD group, a higher Hb level was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. However, the Hb level and mortality showed a U-shaped relationship in the CKD group. After adjusting for age and Charlson Comorbidity Index, multivariable regression analysis showed that an Hb level > 17 g/dL was associated with an increased risk of death in the CKD group with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.085 (95% CI, 1.019-4.264). Hb > 14 g/dL was related to an increased risk of death in advanced CKD patients (OR, 4.579 (95% CI, 1.243-16.866)).

Anemia in CKD is due primarily to reduced production of erythropoietin in the kidney and secondarily to shortened red cell survival. Erythropoeitin (EPO) is produced by peritubular cells in the kidneys of the adult and in hepatocytes in the fetus. These cells are sensitive to hypoxia that once sensed leads to an increase in EPO production. EPO circulates in the plasma and induces redcell production in the bone marrow after successful binding to erythroid progenitor cells. Apart from EPO, folate, B(12) and iron are needed to assure effective erythropoiesis. Factors that can dysregulate this process include inflammation, uremic toxins, hypothyroidism, hypersplenism and ongoing infection.The investigation of renal anemia requires the assessment of a variety of biological indices. Among them, the complete blood count, the reticulocyte index, B(12), folate, ferritin levels and the saturation of transferrin are the most valuable tools in revealing the cause of renal anemia.","2011","Hippokratia",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: Hospitalized T2DM patients (n = 307) with a glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and urinary albumin excretion > 30 mg/24 h (Stage 1 and 2 CKD) were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups based on hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations: those with (mean [ ± SD] Hb 10.7 ± 0.7 g/dL) and without (mean Hb 13.3 ± 1.28 g/dL) anemia. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between patients with and without anemia in terms of age, gender, body mass index, HbA1c, and cardiovascular diseases. The mean length of hospitalization of the 130 anemic and 177 non-anemic patients was 4.3 ± 3.5 and 3.5 ± 1.9 days, respectively (P < 0.001). Twelve anemic patients died within 1 year, compared with three patients without anemia (9.2% vs 1.7%, respectively; P = 0.002).

A number of factors can affect its severity or response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). Some, such as iron deficiency, occult blood loss, infection, inflammation, oxidative stress, inadequate dialysis dose, and hyperparathyroidism are common to all dialysis patients but they may be more or less important depending on dialysis modality. The net balance of their contribution explains the fact that on average PD patients require less ESA doses compared to hemodialysis patients to correct anemia and maintain stable Hb levels. As in other CKD patients, low hemoglobin levels have been associated with increased mortality in PD patients. Unfortunately, no clinical trials have been carried out specifically in this population whether aiming at different Hb targets with ESAs may modify patient outcome. Given the lack of a vascular access, it is advisable to give PD patients ESA therapy subcutaneously. Long-acting molecules may be of advantage, especially when the drug is administered at the dialysis center.","2012","Contributions to nephrology"," Unfortunately , no clinical trials have been carried out specifically in this population whether aiming at different Hb targets with ESAs may modify patient outcome ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

AIMS: To investigate the effects of pre-dialysis resistance training (RT) on sarcopenia, inflammatory profile, and anemia biomarkers in older patients with CKD. METHODS: A total of 107 patients with CKD (65.4 ± 3.7 years) were randomly allocated into four groups: sarcopenic RT (n = 37), non-sarcopenic RT (n = 20), sarcopenic control (n = 28), and non-sarcopenic control (n = 22). DXA and handgrip strength were used to classify sarcopenia according to EWGSOP-2. Treatment groups underwent a 24-week intervention with RT before each dialysis session, three times per week. Blood sample analysis for ferritin, hepcidin, iron availability, and inflammatory profile (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10) was conducted. All-cause mortality was recorded over 5 years. RESULTS: Sarcopenic RT group increased iron availability after the intervention, while their counterparts decreased. Ferritin and hepcidin significantly decreased in sarcopenic RT group. RT elicited a reduction in both TNFα and IL-6, while increasing IL-10 in both intervention groups. The rate of sarcopenic subjects substantially decreased after the intervention period (from 37 to 17 in the RT group; p = 0.01).

Patients aged > or = 18 years with chronic renal disease requiring hemodialysis, with hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the range 9.6-12.4 g/dl, and who had been treated with recombinant erythropoietin for > or = 90 days before study entry were eligible. In the initial double-blind comparative study phase, patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to 24-week treatment with either intravenous (i.v.) epoetin-delta (ED) or epoetin-alpha (EA). Patients then entered a 28-week open-label phase, receiving i.v. ED at a dose equal to that of i.v. ED or EA which they received at the end of the blinded phase. RESULTS: In total, 752 patients were randomized, of whom 555 patients subsequently received ED and 191 patients EA, with 583 patients (77.5%) completing the double-blind phase and entering the open-label phase. There was no significant difference between groups for the primary endpoint: the average Hb level from Weeks 12-24 of the study. The adjusted mean average Hb level for the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was 11.57 g/dl in the ED group (n = 491, mean dose 63.5 IU/kg) and 11.56 g/dl in the EA group (n = 175, mean dose 62.8 IU/kg). Efficacy was maintained on long-term use. Data for Weeks 12-52 show that ED maintained patients' Hb levels in the target range (10-12 g/dl) with a mean Hb level of 11.31 g/dl at a mean ED dose of 63.7 IU/kg. ED therapy was well tolerated, with a similar overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) (94.4%) to the EA group (92.1%) in the double-blind phase (most common events: hypotension, upper respiratory tract infection, muscle cramps, headache). AEs occurring during the open-label phase were generally similar in type and frequency to those reported during the double-blind phase.

METHODS: We performed a systematic search of six academic databases (EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, PubMed, Web of sciences, and MEDLINE), adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We performed a meta-analysis on relevant studies to evaluate the overall influence of ferumoxytol, relative to conventional iron supplement formulations, on hemoglobin levels, ferritin level, and treatment related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) incidence in chronic kidney disease patients. RESULTS: Seven eligible studies were identified from a total of 1397 studies. These studies contained data on 3315 participants with chronic kidney disease (mean age: 59.2 ± 4.6 years). A meta-analysis revealed that ferumoxytol administration had positive effects on hemoglobin levels (Hedge's g statistic: 0.51) and ferritin level (0.88), transferrin saturation (0.39). Besides, we also report reduced incidence of treatment related TEAEs (-0.24) for patients consuming ferumoxytol as compared conventional iron supplement formulations. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence that ferumoxytol use exerts beneficial effects on the overall hematological outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.

","Janković N. and Janković M.","Anemia is highly prevalent among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and patients receiving renal replacement therapy. In this paper we will outline the prevention and treatment of anemia in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). PD patients are less anemic and more sensitive to erythropoesis-stimulating agent (ESA) than their hemodialysis (HD) counterparts and, in general, dosages required for achieving similar hemoglobin levels to those achieved in HD patients are remarkably less. Before starting with ESA treatment we have to evaluate the degree of anemia and excluded other causes which are not connected with CKD and method of treatment. Patient's compliance is crucial for a successful therapy and it can be improved by decreasing frequency of administration of ESA. Since ESAare expensive, ""cost-effectivnes"" studies represent an important factor in choosing a distinct drug. Subcutaneous administration provides better long-term utilization of ESA in comparison to intravenous administration and is therefore preferred in PD patients. Intraperitoneal administration is not recommended due to poor bioavailability. In some patients we can observe the reduced response to ESA therapy. The definition of reduced response is generally regarded as a failure to achieve target hemoglobin concentration of >11 g/dL. Identification of underlying cause is not always easy but every attempt should be made to investigate every patient with resistance to therapy because some causes are easily corrected. Since 2005 particular ESA drugs have been approved by Croatian Institute for Health Insurance and registered for use in Croatia. For PD patients the ESAcan be prescribed by general practitioner.

Current intravenous iron agents cannot be administered in a single high dose because of adverse effects. Ferric carboxymaltose, a non-dextran parenteral iron preparation, can be rapidly administered in high doses. METHODS: This open-label trial randomized 255 subjects with glomerular filtration rates ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), haemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL, transferrin saturation ≤ 25%, ferritin ≤ 300 ng/mL, and stable ESA dose to either intravenous ferric carboxymaltose 1000 mg over 15 min (with up to two additional doses of 500 mg at 2-week intervals) or oral ferrous sulphate 325 mg thrice daily for a total of 195 mg elemental iron daily for 56 days. RESULTS: In the modified intent-to-treat population, the proportion of subjects achieving a haemoglobin increase ≥ 1 g/dL at any time was 60.4% with ferric carboxymaltose and 34.7% with oral iron (P < 0.001). At Day 42, mean increase in haemoglobin was 0.95 ± 1.12 vs 0.50 ± 1.23 g/dL (P = 0.005), mean increase in ferritin was 432 ± 189 ng/mL vs 18 ± 45 ng/mL (P < 0.001) and mean increase in transferrin saturation was 13.6 ± 11.9% vs 6.1 ± 8.1% (P < 0.001).

Statin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase with lipid-lowering effects, may have a pleiotropic effect in reducing inflammation, and thus increase hemoglobin (Hb) level. We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for relevant studies. The population of interest comprised advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and ESKD patients receiving hemodialysis with statin treatment. The included study designs were randomized control trial/cohort study/pre-post observational study, and outcomes of interest were Hb, erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) and ferritin. PRISMA 2020 guidelines were followed, and risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the RoB 2.0 tool in randomized controlled trials, and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) in cohort studies. We eventually included ten studies (5258 participants), comprising three randomized controlled trials and seven cohort studies. Overall, Hb increased by 0.84 g/dL (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.02 to 1.70) in all groups using statins, including single-arm cohorts, and by 0.72 g/dL (95% CI: -0.02 to 1.46) in studies with placebo control. Hb levels were higher in the study group than in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.18 g/dL (95% CI: 0.04-0.32) at baseline and 1.0 g/dL (95% CI: 0.13-1.87) at the endpoint. Ferritin increased by 9.97 ng/mL (95% CI: -5.36 to 25.29) in the study group and decreased by 34.01 ng/mL (95% CI: -148.16 to 80.14) in the control group; ferritin fluctuation was higher in the control group.

SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 2,019 individuals with type 2 diabetes, moderate anemia, and CKD from the placebo arm of the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) followed up for 2.3 years with an average of 32 monthly Hb level determinations per patient. Darbepoetin alfa was administered only if Hb level decreased to <9 g/dL. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Number of protocol-directed doses of darbepoetin alfa received due to an Hb level decrease to <9 g/dL. RESULTS: 1,106 (55%) placebo patients consistently maintained an Hb level ≥9 g/dL and received no protocol-directed darbepoetin alfa. The other patients received 1 (16%), 2-4 (16%), or 5 or more (13%) doses of darbepoetin alfa. Those who received no darbepoetin alfa doses had higher baseline Hb levels, higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs), less proteinuria, and lower ferritin and transferrin saturation values. On average, Hb levels were stable or increased in all groups. Compared with individuals who received no darbepoetin alfa, those who received 5 or more doses were more likely to receive intravenous iron therapy and blood transfusions and progress to renal replacement therapy, but were not at higher risk of death. The strongest predictors of requiring 5 or more doses of darbepoetin alfa were lower baseline Hb level, lower eGFR, and higher proteinuria level.

Results: Twenty-five RCTs (involving 17,204 participants) were included, all of which were designed to achieve target Hb levels by adjusting thee dose of HIF-PHIs. Regarding the efficacy in achieving target Hb levels, no significant differences were found between HIF-PHIs and ESAs in Hb response at the dose-adjusted designed RCTs selected for comparison. Intervention with roxadustat showed a significantly lower risk of RBC transfusion than rhEPO, with an OR and 95% CI of 0.76 (0.56-0.93).

,"31453863"," Anemia in patients of diabetic kidney disease. ","Tsai S. and Tarng D.","Anemia is the major complication resulting from chronic kidney disease (CKD) and also a risk factor for cardiovascular events and a poor quality of life (QoL). Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the major cause of CKD. Initially, insulin resistance has been reported to increase erythropoiesis, but it might be a minor issue. DKD-related anemia developed earlier and was more severe than non-DKD-related anemia based on more complicated mechanisms, including greater bleeding tendency associated with antiplatelet effect, less O2 sensing due to autonomic neuropathy or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use, inhibitory effect of inflammatory cytokines, urinary loss of erythropoietin (EPO), and poor response to EPO. In DKD patients, prompt correction of anemia allows for a better cardiovascular outcome and QoL, which are similar to the promising effect of anemia correction in CKD patients. However, current evidence recommended that the avoidance of a high or normalized hemoglobin (Hb) level has been suggested in the treatment of anemia in DKD patients. Despite that EPO has a pleotropic effect on renal protection from animal studies, the renal benefit was less evident in CKD and DKD patients. Recently, the antidiabetic agent, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), has been reported to exhibit the renal benefits due to the tubulo-glomerular feedback in addition to sugar control. It may also be due to less renal ischemic through higher EPO levels, followed by higher Hb levels. More studies are needed to clarify the link between the renal benefit of SGLT2i and EPO production.","2019","Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Ferumoxytol is a novel, semisynthetic, carbohydrate-coated, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle that is administered IV as an injection. The main objective of this study was to assess the safety of ferumoxytol for the treatment of patients with CKD stages 1 to 5 and 5D. STUDY DESIGN: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter study of a single 510-mg dose of ferumoxytol versus saline as placebo. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 750 patients with CKD stages 1 to 5 and 5D. INTERVENTION: An IV injection of either 17 mL of ferumoxytol or saline placebo over 17 seconds on day 0 and the alternate agent on day 7. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Descriptive comparison of adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs. RESULTS: Of 750 randomly assigned patients with CKD, 60% were not on dialysis therapy. 713 patients received ferumoxytol, and 711 received placebo. There were 420 adverse events reported; 242 in 152 patients (21.3%) with ferumoxytol and 178 in 119 patients (16.7%) with placebo. The incidence of related adverse events was 5.2% with ferumoxytol and 4.5% with placebo. The most common related adverse events after each treatment included symptoms related to the injection/infusion site, dizziness, pruritus, headache, fatigue, and nausea. Serious adverse events occurred in 21 patients (2.9%) after ferumoxytol and 13 patients (1.8%) after placebo. Serious related adverse events were observed in 1 patient (0.1%) after each treatment.

However, whether Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving ARB therapy for chronic cardiac failure and chronic kidney disease develop reduced hemoglobin (Hb) levels has not been elucidated. Thus, this cross-sectional study was conducted, and Hb levels were compared between patients with T2DM with and without ARB administration. No significant difference in the prescribed proportion of antidiabetic medicines such as biguanide, sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, and α-glucosidase inhibitors was found between the group treated with ARBs and the group without ARBs. Thus, we considered that the effects of antidiabetic medicines on the results were minimum. In this study, the Hb levels of patients who received ARBs (13.8 ± 1.7 g/dL) were significantly lower than those of patients without ARBs (14.9 ± 1.35 g/dL) (p = 0.034). The difference between this study and a previous study relies on eGFR levels. Thus, the eGFR levels of the patients in this study and the previous study were above 60 and below 60 mL min(-1)/1.73 m(2), respectively. Despite those differences, both studies showed that the use of ARBs was associated with a decrease in Hb levels in patients with T2DM.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: In this three-arm, comparator-controlled, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, Phase III study, 572 dialysis patients (> or =18 yr) who were receiving stable subcutaneous epoetin one to three times weekly were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to continue epoetin or to receive subcutaneous C.E.R.A. once monthly or twice monthly for 52 wk. Dosage was adjusted to maintain Hb +/-1.0 g/dl of baseline level. Primary end point was mean change in Hb level between baseline and the evaluation period (weeks 29 to 36). RESULTS: Mean Hb levels during the evaluation period were similar between groups (once-monthly C.E.R.A. 11.5 g/dl; twice-monthly C.E.R.A. 11.7 g/dl; epoetin 11.5 g/dl). The difference between C.E.R.A. and epoetin in mean change (97.5% confidence interval) in Hb concentration between baseline and evaluation was -0.022 g/dl (-0.262 to 0.217) for once monthly and 0.141 g/dl (-0.098 to 0.380) for twice monthly. Analysis demonstrated that C.E.R.A. was as effective as epoetin in maintaining Hb and was well tolerated.

","Szeto C. et al.","BACKGROUND: Although originally described in dialysis patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), haemoglobin variability has recently also been noted to be increased in patients who have chronic kidney disease (CKD) without dialysis. In our country, pre-dialysis CKD patients generally would not receive rHuEPO treatment. We studied the degree of haemoglobin variability and its prognostic implication in this group of patients. METHODS: We reviewed 332 patients with Stages 3 through 5 CKD; patients with overt iron deficiency or requiring blood transfusion were excluded. Patients were followed for up to 5 years. End points include all-cause mortality, progression to dialysis-dependent renal failure and hospitalization. RESULTS: The average haemoglobin level was 11.4 ± 2.8 g/dL; intra-individual SD of haemoglobin was 0.76 ± 0.61 g/dL. Haemoglobin variability, as represented by intra-individual SD of haemoglobin, was significantly associated with the average haemoglobin level (r = -0.130, P = 0.017), Charlson's comorbidity score (r = 0.113, P = 0.040) and proteinuria (r = 0.151, P = 0.044). Univariate analysis showed that patients with high haemoglobin variability had a significantly higher all-cause mortality (log-rank test, P = 0.030) and risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (log-rank test, P = 0.021) and was associated with the adjusted duration of hospitalization (r = 0.134, P = 0.015). However, all associations become statistically insignificant after multivariate analysis to control for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Fluctuation of haemoglobin level is common and substantial in Chinese pre-dialysis CKD patients. Our results suggests that the observed clinical effect of haemoglobin variability in this patient population is an epiphenomenon secondary to the association between haemoglobin variability and other clinical factors.","2011","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association"," We studied the degree of haemoglobin variability and its prognostic implication in this group of patients ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Six months after STNx, the heart and kidney were processed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1alpha, erythropoietin (EPO), pro-hepcidin, caspase-3, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6. RESULTS: Hb (g/dL) STNx: 10.8 +/- 0.8, sham: 14.7 +/- 0.6 (P < 0.01); SI (microg/dL) STNx: 154.5 +/- 24.5, sham: 287.5 +/- 32.1 (P < 0.01); heart weight (g) STNx: 2.21 +/- 0.15, sham: 1.12 +/- 0.12 (P < 0.01); FS% STNx: 28.4 +/- 2.5, sham: 45.1 +/- 4.1 (P < 0.01). There was a correlation between Hb and FS% (r = 0.95; P < 0.01) and between SI and FS% (r = 0.86; P < 0.01) in the STNx group.

","Tsao N. et al.","BACKGROUND: In Europe, epoetin subsequent entry biologics (SEBs) have been in use since 2007. Canadian patents of erythropoietin stimulating agents are expiring in 2014, therefore it is predicted that epoetin SEBs will penetrate the Canadian market in the near future. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic impact and costs offsets associated with the uptake and use of one or more epoetin SEBs in Canada for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. DESIGN: A Canada-wide epidemiological-based budget impact analysis was conducted to estimate cost outcomes under two scenarios: with and without the availability of epoetin SEB. SETTING: The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare payer, over a 5-year time horizon from 2015 to 2019. PATIENTS: Patients included in the model were those with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5, who have renal anemia and require treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents. METHODS: Only direct medical costs pertaining to drug acquisition of currently available erythropoietin stimulating agents in Canada were incorporated in the model. Cost of epoetin SEBs, market shares, uptake rates, and other model inputs were estimated from published sources or databases. No discounting of future costs was applied. RESULTS: Based on our analysis, under market phenomena similar to those seen in the Europe and without considering potential switching from originator epoetin to epoetin SEB, we could expect that Canadian adoption of epoetin SEBs could result in $35 million (2013 CAD, year 1) to $50 million (year 5) cost savings annually, with cumulative savings of $221 million after 5 years. In one-way sensitivity analyses, model variables with substantial impact on cost savings were the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and epoetin SEB uptake rates. LIMITATIONS: We did not take into account costs associated with overhead, administration, or adverse events. CONCLUSION: The advent of SEBs represents an opportunity to relieve financial pressure in our healthcare system. Under the assumption that the efficacy and safety of epoetin SEBs are non-inferior to originator products, we have shown that the adoption of epoetin SEBs can lead to cost savings for the Canadian payer.","2014","Canadian journal of kidney health and disease"," OBJECTIVE : To estimate the economic impact and costs offsets associated with the uptake and use of one or more epoetin SEBs in Canada for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Serum creatinine was tested preoperatively and 24 hours and 3 days after PN to evaluate the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Perioperative anemia was evaluated on the basis of the hemoglobin (Hb) value at 24 hours and 3 days postoperation. Patients were then followed up for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Associations between perioperative anemia and postoperative AKI and CKD were determined. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of perioperative anemia was 33.33% in the study. A total of 32.46% of patients suffered from postoperative AKI, and 16.67% of patients progressed to CKD. The incidences of AKI and CKD in perioperative anemia patients were dramatically exceeded in those without anemia. Further statistical analyses indicated that perioperative anemia was a relevant factor for postoperative kidney injury, presenting the highest odds ratio of 31.272 for postoperative AKI and 17.179 for postoperative CKD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that ΔHb=(preoperative Hb)-(postoperative Hb nadir) was a meaningful predictor of postoperative kidney injury, with an area under the curve of 0.784 for predicting postoperative AKI and 0.805 for postoperative CKD.

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PEDro, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases, until May 2020. Two authors independently extracted data from studies. We included observational and RCTs that enrolled CKD patients undergoing anemia treatment with ESA with different achieved Hb levels among groups. We excluded studies with achieved Hb < 9 g/dL. For the meta-analysis, we included RCTs with control groups achieving Hb 10-11.5 g/dL and active groups with Hb > 11.5 g/dL. We analyzed the standardized mean difference (SMD) between groups for physical HRQOL. RESULTS: Among 8496 studies, fifteen RCTs and five observational studies were included for the systematic review. We performed the meta-analysis in a subset of eleven eligible RCTs. For physical role and physical function, SMDs were 0.0875 [95% CI: - 0.0025 - 0.178] and 0.08 [95% CI: - 0.03 - 0.19], respectively. For fatigue, SMD was 0.16 [95% CI: 0.09-0.24].

Proportion of older and long-term diabetic patients across studies were associated with lower effect sizes. CONCLUSION: Achieved hemoglobin higher than currently recommended targets may be associated with small but potentially clinically significant improvement in fatigue, but not in physical role or physical function.

This is because of the recent publication of two randomized controlled studies in nondialysis CKD patients, the CREATE and CHOIR studies, as well as an accompanying meta-analysis. These studies demonstrate increase risk for death and cardiovascular complications when aiming for a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of >12 g/dl. In light of this new data, the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative anemia guidelines are being revised. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a Black Box warning and indicated that hemoglobin levels do not exceed 12 g/dl. While observational data suggest a benefit for higher hemoglobin levels, these studies have limitations because of their retrospective design and the potential effect of confounding factors. Hence, reliance on observational studies to guide CKD anemia treatment is a potentially flawed and hazardous process.

The Cardiovascular Reduction Early Anemia Treatment Epoetin beta (CREATE) study was designed from the hypothesis that, as anemia develops early in the course of CKD and nearly at the same time as cardiovascular disease, its earlier correction may provide better protection against the development of cardiovascular abnormalities. This randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial involved 603 patients who had moderate anemia (hemoglobin 11 to 12.5 g/dl) and stage 3 to 4 CKD (estimated GFR 15 to 35 ml/min) and were randomly assigned to attain complete or partial anemia correction. The final results are due to be published within a few months, but the preliminary analyses do not show that complete anemia correction leads to any cardiovascular advantage, although the cardiovascular event rate was half that expected, possibly as a result of patient selection, trial effect, and improved medical care.

","Tsuruya K. and Hirakata H.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now recognized as a risk factor of both end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and independently cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, a specific renoprotective intervention is strongly recommended, including blood pressure control as well as anemia improvement with erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs). Treatment of renal anemia with ESAs has been proved to improve quality of life (QOL) and finally reduce patient mortality. Recently, Silverberg, et al. created a novel clinical entity of Cardio-Renal Anemia (CRA) syndrome, in which anemia plays a key role for worsening both CKD and cardiac performance in a vicious circle. An appropriate and vigorous treatment of anemia has now been accepted to terminate or weaken the circle. Recently, two large-scaled randomized controlled trials were reported, being the CREATE (cardiovascular risk reduction by early anemia treatment with epoetin beta) study and the CHOIR (correction of hemoglobin and outcomes in renal insufficiency) study. They demonstrated that early initiation of ESA treatment and targeting at higher hemoglobin level (near normal level) failed to show the lowering effects for cardiovascular events as compared to a group in which Hb targeting was lower (sub-normal level) in pre-dialysis CKD patients. While there has been many argues in these reports especially about baseline patients characteristics, being a quite high incidence of severe cardiovascular co-morbidity. Thus, further evidences should be accumulated to resolve a proper target level of Hb in ESA treatment.","2008","Nihon rinsho.

","Sonia S. et al.","Anemia is one of the common complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Erythropoietin and iron deficiencies are the major causes to develop anemia in CKD patients. Untreated anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESA) with iron supplementation are the standard for treating renal anemia. Although ESA with iron supplementation is an effective therapy in maintaining serum hemoglobin (Hb) levels, it increases the risk of several life-threatening adverse events such as hypertension, thromboembolism, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality with long-term use. Therefore, effective alternate therapy with better safety and efficacy is needed to treat renal anemia. The newer oral therapy hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHI) can potentially be an effective alternative therapy in treating renal anemia. This review article compares the safety and efficacy between HIF-PHI and ESA in treating anemia in CKD patients. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of articles, including clinical trials, meta-analyses, and reviews, that compared the safety and efficacy between HIF-PHI and ESA. Studies have shown that the newer oral therapy, HIF-PHI, was non-inferior to ESA to maintain serum Hb levels in CKD patients. Moreover, the adverse event profile was almost similar in both groups. However, as the studies we reviewed have small sample sizes and short duration periods, the long-term effectiveness and safety of HIF-PHI over ESA in treating renal anemia cannot be established.","2023","Cureus",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"32309288"," Treatment of Renal Anemia with Roxadustat: Advantages and Achievement. ","Li Z. et al.","BACKGROUND: Although renal anemia has attracted widespread attention, a large proportion of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with anemia still do not meet the hemoglobin (Hb) targets. The discovery of prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes as regulators of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent erythropoiesis has led to the development of novel therapeutic agents for renal anemia. Roxadustat, the first small-molecule HIF-PHD inhibitor, has completed the phase 3 trials. There are currently more than 15 phase 3 clinical trials worldwide assessing the efficacy and safety of roxadustat in CKD patients with anemia. This review will summarize recent findings of roxadustat in the treatment of renal anemia. SUMMARY: Although the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron supplementation are a well-established and highly effective therapeutic approach for renal anemia, there are several safety concerns. Current findings from phase 2 and 3 trials suggest that roxadustat is clinically effective and well tolerated. On the one hand, roxadustat could increase endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) levels within or near physiological range in a titratable manner by inducing HIF pathway activation transiently. On the other hand, roxadustat also improves iron metabolism by decreasing serum hepcidin and increasing intestinal iron absorption, which is beneficial to functional iron deficiency and absolute iron deficiency. More importantly, the erythropoietic response of roxadustat is independent of baseline inflammatory state of CKD patients. Thus, the discovery of roxadustat will revolutionize the treatment strategy for renal anemia. KEY MESSAGES: Roxadustat is an emerging and promising therapeutic approach against anemia in CKD patients, which differs from those of conventional ESAs. Roxadustat corrects anemia of CKD patients through multiple pathways, beyond elevating EPO levels within physiological range, and also by handling iron metabolism (particularly decreasing the hepcidin levels). Furthermore, the Hb response of roxadustat is independent of the inflammatory microenvironment.","2020","Kidney diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The REN-001 and REN-002 phase II, multicenter, randomized studies examined safety, tolerability, and effects of sotatercept, an ActRIIA-IgG1 fusion protein trap, on hemoglobin concentration; REN-001 also explored effects on bone mineral density (BMD) and abdominal aortic vascular calcification. METHODS: Forty-three patients were treated in REN-001 (dose range: sotatercept 0.3‒0.7 mg/kg or placebo subcutaneously [s.c.] for 200 days) and 50 in REN-002 (dose range: 0.1‒0.4 mg/kg i.v. and 0.13‒0.5 mg/kg s.c. for 99 days). RESULTS: In REN-001, frequency of achieving target hemoglobin response (>10 g/dl [6.21 mmol/l]) with sotatercept was dose-related and greater than placebo (0.3 mg/kg: 33.3%; 0.5 mg/kg: 62.5%; 0.7 mg/kg: 77.8%; 0.7 mg/kg [doses 1 and 2]/0.4 mg/kg [doses 3‒15]: 33.3%; placebo: 27.3%). REN-002 hemoglobin findings were similar (i.v.: 16.7%-57.1%; s.c.: 11.1%‒42.9%). Dose-related achievement of ≥2% increase in femoral neck cortical BMD was seen among only REN-001 patients receiving sotatercept (0.3‒0.7 mg/kg: 20.0%‒57.1%; placebo: 0.0%). Abdominal aortic vascular calcification was slowed in a dose-related manner, with a ≤15% increase in Agatston score achieved by more REN-001 sotatercept versus placebo patients (60%‒100% vs. 16.7%). The most common adverse events during treatment were hypertension, muscle spasm, headache, arteriovenous fistula site complication, and influenza observed in both treatment and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with ESKD, sotatercept exhibited a favorable safety profile and was associated with trends in dose-related slowing of vascular calcification.

This meta-analysis included 43 officially published articles and 3 unpublished studies (27 338 patients). HIF stabilizer treatment significantly increased hemoglobin (Hb) level when compared with placebo (mean difference 1.19 g/dL; 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.44 g/dL; P < .001). There was no significant difference in Hb level when compared with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Significant reductions of ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were observed, while total iron-binding capacity was increased in the HIF stabilizer group compared with placebo or ESAs. HIF stabilizers significantly reduced hepcidin, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. Acute kidney injury and thrombotic events were significantly observed in patients receiving HIF stabilizers. There were no significant differences in myocardial infarction, stroke, dialysis initiation, pulmonary hypertension and mortality between HIF stabilizer and control groups. The present meta-analysis provided evidence that HIF stabilizers increased Hb and TIBC levels and reduced hepcidin, ferritin and TSAT in CKD patients with renal anemia.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be elucidated. Our aim was to study hyporesponsiveness to rHuEPO therapy using the remnant kidney rat model of anemia associated with CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. At starting, male Wistar rats were divided in 3 groups, for a 3-week protocol: Sham, CRF (vehicle) and two rHuEPO (200 k/kg body weight [BW]/week) treated groups; at the end of protocol, the rHuEPO treated rats were subdivided in responders (CRF200) and non-responders (CRF200NR), according to their hematologic response; blood, cellular and tissue studies were performed. The CRF200 group achieved correction of anemia, while the CRF200NR group developed anemia, after an initial response (1st week) to rHuEPO therapy. CRF and CRF200NR groups presented a trend to higher serum CRP levels; CRF200NR showed also high levels of renal inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, nuclear factor kappa B, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); no changes were found in iron metabolism. Our data suggest that the development of anemia/rHuEPO hyporesponsiveness is associated with a higher systemic and renal inflammatory condition, favoring hypoxia and triggering an increase in renal expression of HIF-1α, TGF-β1 and CTGF that will further aggravate renal fibrosis, which will enhance the inflammatory response, creating a cycle that promotes disease progression. New therapeutic strategies to reduce inflammation in CKD patients could improve the response to rHuEPO therapy and reduce hyporesponsiveness.","2016","Biochimie"," Our aim was to study hyporesponsiveness to rHuEPO therapy using the remnant kidney rat model of anemia associated with CKD induced by 5 / 6 nephrectomy ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

In addition to drug acquisition costs, the administration of ESAs can include direct and indirect costs due to the needle-based route of administration (eg, time spent by health care staff administering therapy, and patients' and caregivers' time spent receiving or assisting with therapy). However, a comprehensive assessment of the costs associated with the administration of ESAs is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess costs associated with the needle-based administration of ESAs for the treatment of anemia due to non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD in the United States in 2019 from a societal perspective. METHODS: Excess costs associated with ESA administration were estimated as the sum of annual costs that could be avoided with the introduction of an oral treatment with comparable safety and efficacy to ESAs. Cost components included direct health care costs, transportation costs, and work productivity loss costs from the perspective of both patients and caregivers (as applicable). Costs were estimated based on scientific publications, governmental agencies, and the results of a recent survey of US patients and caregivers of patients with anemia and CKD. The setting of the administration (ie, at home vs in clinic), frequency of administration, and insurance type were considered. RESULTS: At the societal level, annual excess costs associated with ESA administration were estimated at $2.5 billion in the United States in 2019, based on an estimated 462,005 patients with anemia and NDD-CKD treated with ESAs. Overall, 94.4% ($2.4 billion) of these costs were incurred from in-clinic ESA administration. When stratifying costs by insurance type, Medicare-insured patients accounted for 79.4% ($2.0 billion) of total annual excess costs. The largest contributor to total annual excess costs was direct health care costs ($1.4 billion, 54.9%), followed by patient work productivity loss costs ($846 million, 33.9%), caregiver work productivity loss costs ($197 million, 7.9%), and transportation costs ($81 million, 3.3%). Total annual excess costs of in-clinic administration ranged from $2,572 per patient receiving monthly administration to $20,948 per patient receiving thrice-weekly administration, while the total annual excess costs of at-home administration ranged from $1,123 per patient receiving monthly administration to $2,109 per patient receiving thrice-weekly administration. At the ESA administration level (ie, for each ESA administration), total excess costs were estimated at $128 per in-clinic ESA administration and $7 per at-home ESA administration, excluding monitoring costs. CONCLUSIONS: The needle-based administration of ESAs in patients with NDD-CKD is associated with a substantial economic burden.

However, long-term safety (in terms of mortality, cardiovascular/infection risk and tissue deposition) of high-dose intravenous iron supplementation with such high target levels of ferritin/TSAT has not been confirmed. Recently, there has been increase in the use of intravenous iron and average ferritin levels in dialysis patients in the United States. Clinical trials conducted so far have been underpowered to conclusively establish the long-term safety of intravenous iron supplementation. Results from observational studies are conflicting, and many experimental studies have even shown negative effects of intravenous iron. Clearly, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed, studying various doses of intravenous iron, with sufficient patient numbers and longer observation periods, to investigate mortality, cardiovascular effects and infection risks of this treatment. Until the long-term safety of iron supplementation at high doses is established, a more prudent decision on iron supplementation with lower target levels of ferritin/TSAT seems reasonable, in light of the decades of experience with ESA that has shown that definitive clinical outcomes have been dissociated from surrogate outcomes (especially hemoglobin concentration).","2015","Nephron"," Clearly , randomized clinical trials are urgently needed , studying various doses of intravenous iron , with sufficient patient numbers and longer observation periods , to investigate mortality , cardiovascular effects and infection risks of this treatment ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Trivedi R. and Barve K.","Anemia poses a threat to a broad population globally as depleted hemoglobin leads to a plethora of conditions, and the most common cause includes iron deficiency. Iron is an essential element important for erythropoiesis, DNA synthesis, protection of the immune system, energy production, and cognitive function and hence should be maintained at appropriate levels. Various proteins are involved in transporting and absorption of iron, activation of heme synthesis, and RBC production that could be possible targets to improve iron delivery. Oral supplementation of iron either from dietary or synthetic sources has been the frontline therapy for treating iron deficiency in anemia. At the same time, intravenous administration is provided in chronic anemia, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKD). This review focuses on the strategies developed to overcome the disadvantages of available iron therapies and increase iron absorption and uptake in the body to restore iron content. Nanotechnology combined with the food fortification processes gained attention as they help develop new delivery systems to improve iron uptake by enterocytes. Furthermore, naturally obtained products such as polysaccharides, peptides, proteins, and new synthetic molecules have been used in fabrication of iron-carrier systems. The establishment of transdermal iron delivery systems such as microneedle arrays or iontophoresis, or the discovery of new molecules also proved to be an effective way for delivering iron in patients non-compliant to oral therapy.","2021","International journal of pharmaceutics",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"26372086"," New Treatment Approaches for the Anemia of CKD. ","Bonomini M. et al.","Normocytic normochromic anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease and is associated with many adverse clinical consequences. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and adjuvant iron therapy represent the primary treatment for anemia in chronic kidney disease. The introduction of ESAs into clinical practice was a success story, mediating an increase in hemoglobin concentrations without the risk for recurrent blood transfusions and improving quality of life substantially. However, recombinant ESAs are still expensive and require a parenteral route of administration. Moreover, concern has arisen following randomized clinical trials showing that higher hemoglobin targets and/or high ESA doses may cause significant harm. This, together with changes in ESA reimbursement policy in some countries, has resulted in a significant reduction in ESA prescribing and the hemoglobin level targeted during therapy. Several attempts are being made to develop new drugs with improved characteristics and/or easier manufacturing processes compared with currently available ESAs, including new treatment approaches that may indirectly improve erythropoiesis. We give an update on the new investigational strategies for increasing erythropoiesis, examining in depth their characteristics and possible advantages in the clinical setting and the caveats to be aware of at the present stage of development.","2016","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Syed A. and Bhandari S.","BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) iron is commonly used for correcting iron deficiency anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There remains a concern for its use in patients with asthma as it may trigger an acute exacerbation. Pre-treatment with a single dose of parenteral hydrocortisone may obviate this risk. METHOD: We carried out a prospective study of known asthmatic patients with CKD requiring single-dose iron repletion therapy. We analysed the efficacy and safety of IV CosmoFer (low molecular weight iron dextran). Twenty non-dialysis CKD patients with iron deficiency anaemia and a history of asthma were enrolled. Severity of asthma and level of control were recorded as per British Thoracic Society Guidelines and Royal Collage of Physician questionnaire, respectively. All patients received IV hydrocortisone 30 min before the test dose of CosmoFer followed by the remaining total dose. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions. Haemoglobin, serum ferritin levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were measured pre and 6-weeks post-infusion. All patients were followed up until 6 weeks to assess the control of their asthma. RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the study. No patient experienced acute hypersensitivity or infusion reactions. At 6 weeks follow-up, no patient reported worsening of their asthma. There was an increase in mean haemoglobin from 10.1 to 11.1 g/dl and mean ferritin from 93.5 to 302.6 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that IV CosmoFer may be administered safely in asthmatics by administering a single 50 mg dose of hydrocortisone pre-infusion.","2016","QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
,"16412965"," Anemia in the kidney-transplant patient. ","Joist H. et al.","Anemia, a potentially correctable cardiovascular risk factor, continues to be a major problem in kidney-transplant patients. Erythropoietin levels increase rapidly after successful kidney transplantation, and by 3 months, most patients achieve hemoglobin levels greater than 12 g/dL. Anemia may be caused by problems commonly seen in the general population such as iron deficiency or gastrointestinal blood loss, by immunosuppressive medications, or by more rare abnormalities such as hemolytic uremic syndrome or parvovirus B19-induced aplastic anemia. Iron deficiency is common at the time of transplantation and beyond and frequently contributes to anemia. Markers of iron deficiency (ferritin or transferrin saturation) are frequently inconclusive because of the presence of inflammation and infection. Immunosuppressive medications, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), are a common cause of mild bone-marrow suppression and, thus, anemia. Sirolimus can cause more severe bone-marrow suppression, although this effect can lessen over time. The transplant patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently develops anemia, yet agents such as epoetin-alpha and darbepoetin are greatly underutilized. Evaluation of anemia should be undertaken when hemoglobin fails to normalize by 3 months after transplantation. Later after transplantation, especially in the setting of chronic allograft dysfunction, evaluation should take place when the hemoglobin falls to less than 11 g/dL in premenopausal females or to less than 12 g/dL in males and postmenopausal females.","2006","Advances in chronic kidney disease",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Anemia, which is a frequent and early complication of CKD, not only impairs patients' quality of life, but also is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This may be due to its impact on cardiac function leading to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Starting from the clear association between higher hemoglobin levels and better outcomes found in observational surveys, a number of interventional studies have been designed to verify whether correcting anemia fully improves patient outcomes. The results have not indicated any major effect, although the majority of the studies were not primarily designed to test the effect of anemia correction on mortality. This is especially true in the case of CKD patients not undergoing dialysis. Many of these studies have also suffered from relatively short follow-up periods and from the fact that their statistical power was reduced because the difference in achieved hemoglobin levels between the experimental and control groups was often less than expected.

DESIGN: An open-label, randomized, multicenter, controlled study consisting of a 1-week screening phase and a 26-week open-label treatment phase. SETTING: Twenty-seven long term care (LTC) facilities in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with CKD who were not receiving dialysis, who had not received an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent for 8 weeks before screening, and whose Hb levels were lower than 11.0 g/dL at screening were eligible. INTERVENTION: In the epoetin alfa group, subjects were administered 20,000 international units epoetin alfa subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W). Dosing was based on the Hb concentration measurement obtained by HemoCue Hb201+System (Quest Diagnostics; Madison, NJ) at the time of the scheduled dose. When the Hb concentration was 11.0 to 11.5 g/dL on 2 consecutive biweekly measurements, the dose was doubled and administered on the day that the second consecutive measurement was obtained. The dosing interval was then extended to every 4 weeks (Q4W). Subjects in the standard of care (SOC) group received treatment for their anemia according to the practice of the LTC facility. MEASUREMENTS: Study visits were every 2 weeks, at which time blood was drawn and used for efficacy analysis. Measurements included: the Hb concentration change from baseline to the end of the study; the proportion of subjects who achieved an Hb response (defined as 2 consecutive Hb measurements at least 1.0 g/dL greater than baseline or 2 consecutive Hb measurements ≥11.0 g/dL at any time during the study); the time to the Hb response; the proportion of subjects who received a transfusion and the number of units of transfused; the proportion of epoetin alfa-treated subjects converting to Q4W dosing; and the proportion of subjects who converted to Q4W dosing and remained on Q4W dosing through the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 157 subjects were randomized: 118 subjects to the epoetin alfa group and 39 to the SOC group. The mean change in Hb was significantly greater in the epoetin alfa group (0.9 g/dL) compared with the SOC group (0.3 g/dL) (P = .006). A significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved a Hb response in the epoetin alfa group (85.1%) compared with the SOC group (53.8%) (P < .001). The time to achieve a Hb response was significantly shorter in the epoetin alfa group (41 days) than in the SOC group (114 days) (P < .0001). There were no transfusions in the SOC group, whereas 4 subjects (3.5%) required transfusions in the epoetin alfa group. Of the 114 subjects receiving epoetin alfa, 33 (28.9%) subjects were converted to Q4W dosing, and all subjects who converted were able to be maintained on this schedule.

METHODS: Patients were assigned to subcutaneous C.E.R.A. at 3 doses: 0.15, 0.30 and 0.60 microg/kg/wk. During the first 6 weeks, dose adjustments for efficacy were not permitted in order to assess dose response. Within each of the 3 dose groups, patients were randomized to receive C.E.R.A. QW, Q2W or Q3W; the total dose during the first 6 weeks was the same for a particular dose group across the frequency subgroups. During the next 12 weeks, dose was adjusted according to predefined hemoglobin (Hb) criteria. The primary efficacy parameter was change in Hb over 6 weeks, estimated from regression analysis between baseline and the point at which the patient received a dose change or blood transfusion. It therefore provided an estimate of Hb increase based on starting dose. Other endpoints included Hb response rate (proportion of patients with a Hb increase > 1.0 g/dl on 2 consecutive occasions). A 1-year extension period investigated long term tolerability and efficacy. RESULTS: A dose-dependent relationship was noted in the mean change in Hb from baseline over 6 weeks (p < 0.0001), independent of administration schedule (p = 0.9201). There was also a significant relationship between Hb change and median serum C.E.R.A. concentration (p < 0.0001). Erythropoietic responses were sustained in all groups with mean changes from baseline in Hb > 1.2 g/dl observed at doses > or = 0.30 microg/kg/wk. Hb response rate increased with increasing dose: 67, 72 and 90% with C.E.R.A. 0.15, 0.30 and 0.60 microg/kg/wk, respectively. Generally, the median Hb response time was faster with increasing dose (89, 43 and 31 days, respectively). Response was unrelated to administration frequency. Stable Hb concentrations were maintained throughout the 1-year extension period. C.E.R.A. was generally well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were hypertension, urinary tract infection and renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: C.E.R.A. corrected anemia and maintained sustained and stable control of Hb over 1 year.

Numerous reports have shown the association between uremia and oxidative stress, which increases patients' risk for cumulative injury to multiple organs. Anemia is a common and disabling feature of CKD and seems to be a main cause of oxidative stress; correction of anemia represents an effective approach to reduce oxidative stress and, consequently, cardiovascular risk. There is increasing evidence that correction of anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents could protect from oxidative stress in patients with CKD and ESRD. However, iron deficiency frequently complicates anemia in patients with CKD, and ferrous iron cation is a co-factor that is needed for hydroxyl radical production, which can promote cytotoxicity and tissue injury. This has raised a justifiable concern that prescription of intravenous iron may exacerbate oxidative stress and, hence, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and progression of cardiovascular disease, which are widely known consequences of CKD. Correction of anemia represents an effective approach to reduce oxidative stress and, consequently, cardiovascular risk. Iron deficiency is a common cause of resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and the overall risk-benefit ratio favors use of intravenous iron to treat iron deficiency in patients with CKD. Consecutive or combined treatment with intravenous iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents clearly is beneficial for patients with CKD and iron deficiency, and anemia and could contribute to prevent the risk for cardiovascular events in these patients.","2006","Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The median follow-up was 3.48 years (interquartile range, 1.94-5.82) for the competing events of ESRD and pre-ESRD mortality. Time-fixed and time-dependent Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for ESRD and mortality according to HbA1c, treated continuously or in tertiles. RESULTS: At inclusion, the mean mGFR was 42.2±19.9 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and the mean HbA1c value was 5.5%±0.5%. During follow-up, 109 patients died, and 162 patients reached ESRD. Pre-ESRD mortality was significantly associated with HbA1c treated continuously: for every 1% higher HbA1c, the crude HR was 2.16 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.27 to 3.68), and it was 1.85 (95% CI, 1.05 to 3.24) after adjustment for mGFR and other risk factors of death.

With the advent of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs), considerable improvement has been achieved in the management of anemia. However, some patients show a reduced response to ESAs. METHODS: Many factors affect the response to ESA treatment. CKD is now considered as an inflammatory disorder and this understanding led to the recognition of the central role of inflammation in ESA resistance. Inflammation is related to untoward outcomes, including atherosclerosis and anemia, in the CKD population. Furthermore, recognition of deleterious effects of proinflammatory markers at different levels of erythropoiesis led to a change in the name of 'anemia of chronic disease' to anemia of inflammation. RESULTS: The discovery of hepcidin as the major controller of iron metabolism in anemia of inflammation answered many questions regarding the interaction of erythropoietin, iron and bone marrow. Hepcidin production in the liver is driven by three major factors: inflammation, iron overload and anemia/hypoxia. Hepcidin levels are increased in patients with CKD due to the interaction of many factors; a comprehensive understanding of these pathways is thus critical in the effort to alleviate anemia of inflammation and ESA resistance. CONCLUSION: In this review, we discussed the epidemiology, determinants and consequences of anemia of inflammation in CKD patients with special emphasis on the central role of hepcidin along with molecular pathways driving its production.","2011","Blood purification",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Here we tested whether inflammation and iron deficiency regulate FGF23. In wild-type mice, acute inflammation induced by single injections of heat-killed Brucella abortus or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) decreased serum iron within 6 h, and was accompanied by significant increases in osseous Fgf23 mRNA expression and serum levels of C-terminal FGF23, but no changes in intact FGF23. Chronic inflammation induced by repeated bacteria or IL-1β injections decreased serum iron, increased osseous Fgf23 mRNA, and serum C-terminal FGF23, but modestly increased biologically active, intact FGF23 serum levels. Chronic iron deficiency mimicked chronic inflammation. Increased osseous FGF23 cleavage rather than a prolonged half-life of C-terminal FGF23 fragments accounted for the elevated C-terminal FGF23 but near-normal intact FGF23 levels in inflammation. IL-1β injection increased Fgf23 mRNA and C-terminal FGF23 levels similarly in wildtype and Col4a3(ko) mice with CKD but markedly increased intact FGF23 levels only in the CKD mice. Inflammation increased Fgf23 transcription by activating Hif1α signaling. Thus, inflammation and iron deficiency stimulate FGF23 production.

SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: The study included 620,095 veterans aged≥45 years with incident stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]<60mL/min/1.73m(2)) between January 2005 and December 2016 in the US Veterans Health Administration system and followed through December 31, 2018, for incident dementia, kidney failure, or death. EXPOSURE: Anemia was assessed based on the average of hemoglobin levels (g/L) during the 2 years before the date of incident CKD and categorized as normal, mild, or moderate/severe anemia (≥12.0, 11.0-11.9,<11.0g/dL, respectively, for women, and≥13.0, 11.0-12.9,<11.0g/dL for men). OUTCOME: Dementia and the composite outcome of kidney failure or death. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Adjusted cause-specific hazard ratios were estimated for each outcome. RESULTS: At the time of incident CKD, the mean age of the participants was 72 years, 97% were male, and their mean eGFR was 51mL/min per 1.73m(2). Over a median 4.1 years of follow-up, 92,306 veterans (15%) developed dementia before kidney failure or death. Compared with the veterans with CKD without anemia, the multivariable-adjusted models showed a 16% (95% CI, 14%-17%) significantly higher risk of dementia for those with mild anemia and a 27% (95% CI, 23%-31%) higher risk with moderate/severe anemia. Combined risk of kidney failure or death was higher at 39% (95% CI, 37%-40%) and 115% (95% CI, 112%-119%) for mild and moderate/severe anemia, respectively, compared with no anemia.

","Klip I. et al.","AIMS: Iron deficiency (ID), anaemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common co-morbidities in chronic heart failure (CHF) and all independent predictors of unfavourable outcome. The combination of anaemia and CKD in CHF has been described as the cardiorenal-anaemia syndrome. However, the role of ID within this complex interplay of co-existing pathologies is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the clinical correlates of ID (defined as ferritin <100 µg/L or 100-299 µg/L in combination with a transferrin saturation <20%, anaemia) and renal dysfunction (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ) and their prognostic implications in an international pooled cohort, comprising 1506 patients with CHF. Mean age was 64 ± 13 years, 74.2% were male, and 47.3% were in NYHA functional class III. The presence of ID, anaemia, CKD, or a combination of these co-morbidities was observed in 69.3% of the patients. During a median (Q1-Q3) follow-up of 1.92 years (1.18-3.26 years), 440 patients (29.2%) died. Eight-year survival rates decreased significantly from 58.0% for no co-morbidities to 44.6, 33.0, and 18.4%, for one, two, or three co-morbidities, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate hazard models revealed ID to be the key determinant of prognosis, either individually (P = 0.04) or in combination with either anaemia (P = 0.006), CKD (P = 0.03), or both (P = 0.02).

As concerns regarding cardiovascular safety and erythropoietin resistance to ESAs have emerged, alternative therapies are urgently needed. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), an oral agent, has been proven to be effective in improving renal anemia. However, the effects of HIF-PHIs on nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) have yet to be supported by updated meta-analyses. METHODS: A meta-analysis of clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on HIF-PHI treatment of NDD-CKD patients based on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases as of July 16th, 2023, was conducted. The primary outcomes were the level of hemoglobin (Hb) postintervention and the ratio of Hb responses. Most of the analysis was conducted via RevMan 5.3 software using a random-effects model. Stata (version 15.0) was used to analyze the publication bias. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with a total of 7178 subjects in the HIF-PHI group, 3501 subjects in the ESA group and 2533 subjects in the placebo group were enrolled. HIF-PHIs increased the level of Hb and improved iron metabolism but were not inferior to ESAs in terms of safety.

The aim of our study was to determine the FID status of haemodialysis patients in central South Africa, using the %Hypo analyte and to evaluate the ability of the currently used biochemical tests, transferrin saturation (TSat) and serum ferritin to diagnose FID. METHODS: For this study, 49 patients on haemodialysis were recruited. Haemoglobin (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV) and %Hypo were measured on the Advia 2120i. Biochemical analytes (serum ferritin, TSat) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 49 participants, 21 (42.9%) were diagnosed with FID (%Hypo >6%). A large number of patients (91.8%) were anaemic. The TSat demonstrated poor sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing FID compared with %Hypo. The use of %Hypo (rather than TSat) to guide intravenous iron use spared 16 patients the potential harmful effects thereof. CONCLUSION: Using %Hypo as a single analyte to diagnose FID will lead to more appropriate use of limited resources and a reduction in treatment-related complications.","2016","International journal of laboratory hematology"," The aim of our study was to determine the FID status of haemodialysis patients in central South Africa , using the % Hypo analyte and to evaluate the ability of the currently used biochemical tests , transferrin saturation ( TSat ) and serum ferritin to diagnose FID ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: We evaluated anemia prevalence and treatment using two datasets: the Medicare 20% random sample (ages 66-85 years), and the Truven Health MarketScan database (ages 18-63 years). We selected stage 3-5 NDD-CKD patients with and without anemia from both databases during 2011-2013. We evaluated anemia prevalence and treatment (erythropoietin stimulating agents [ESAs], intravenous [IV] iron, red blood cell [RBC] transfusions) following anemia diagnosis during a 1-year baseline period, and healthcare utilization during a 1-year follow-up period. We used Poisson regression models to compare healthcare utilization in patients with and without anemia, adjusting for demographics, baseline comorbid conditions, inflammatory conditions, and CKD stage. RESULTS: We identified 218,079 older and 56,188 younger stage 3-5 NDD-CKD patients. Anemia prevalence increased with age in both datasets; was higher in women, black patients (Medicare only), and patients with comorbid conditions; and rose sharply with increasing CKD stage. Of 15,716 younger anemic patients, 11.7%, 10.8%, and 9.4% were treated with RBC transfusion, ESAs, and IV iron, respectively. Corresponding proportions of 109,251 older anemic patients were 22.2%, 12.7%, and 6.7%. Regardless of age, anemic patients were more likely than non-anemic patients to use healthcare resources, including hospitalizations and emergency department, hematologist, nephrologist, and outpatient visits. Anemic NDD-CKD patients were more likely to be treated with RBC transfusion than with ESAs or IV iron.

Analyses of dialysis cohorts in the United States produced conflicting results regarding the association of Hb variability with patient outcomes. Here, we determined Hb variability in 5037 European hemodialysis (HD) patients treated over 2 years to identify predictors of high variability and to evaluate its association with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. We assessed Hb variability with various methods using SD, residual SD, time-in-target (11.0 to 12.5 g/dl), fluctuation across thresholds, and area under the curve (AUC). Hb variability was significantly greater among incident patients than prevalent patients. Compared with previously described cohorts in the United States, residual SD was similar but fluctuations above target were less frequent. Using logistic regression, age, body mass index, CVD history, dialysis vintage, serum albumin, Hb, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use, ESA use, dialysis access type, dialysis access change, and hospitalizations were significant predictors of high variability. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression showed that SD, residual SD, time-in-target, and AUC did not predict all-cause or CVD mortality during a median follow-up of 12.4 months (IQR: 7.7 to 17.4). However, patients with consistently low levels of Hb (<11 g/dl) and those who fluctuated between the target range and <11 g/dl had increased risks for death (RR 2.34; 95% CI: 1.24 to 4.41 and RR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.00 to 3.04, respectively).

STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 1,432 participants with CKD and anemia. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to target hemoglobin levels of 13.5 versus 11.3 g/dL with the use of epoetin alfa. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Cox regression was used to estimate HRs for progression of CKD (a composite of doubling of creatinine level, initiation of renal replacement therapy, or death). Interactions between hemoglobin target and select baseline variables (estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, diabetes, heart failure, and smoking history) also were examined. RESULTS: Participants randomly assigned to higher hemoglobin targets experienced shorter time to progression of kidney disease in both univariate (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-1.52; P = 0.02) and multivariable models (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.48; P = 0.05). These differences were attributable to higher rates of renal replacement therapy and death for participants in the high hemoglobin arm. Hemoglobin target did not interact with estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, diabetes, or heart failure (P > 0.05 for all). In the multivariable model, hemoglobin target interacted with tobacco use (P = 0.04) such that the higher target had a greater risk of CKD progression for participants who currently smoked (HR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.23-5.09; P = 0.01), which was not present for those who did not currently smoke (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.93-1.41; P = 0.2). LIMITATIONS: A post hoc analysis; thus, cause and effect cannot be determined. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a high hemoglobin target is associated with a greater risk of progression of CKD. This risk may be augmented by concurrent smoking.

,"19833907"," The relationship between hemoglobin levels and endothelial functions in diabetes mellitus. ","Sonmez A. et al.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hemoglobin (Hb) is the main carrier and buffer of nitric oxide. Evidence has been produced that Hb concentration is inversely related with endothelial function in human diseases. Testing whether this association exists also in diabetic patients stage 1 to 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) is important because anemia in these patients starts at an earlier stage than in other renal diseases. The relationship was investigated between Hb and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) levels of the patients with diabetic nephropathy in a cross-sectional design. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Eighty-nine diabetics with mild to moderate proteinuria and normal to mildly reduced GFR who were normotensive, nondyslipidemic, and cardiovascular-events free were enrolled. None of the patients was taking metformin or renin-angiotensin system blockers. RESULTS: FMD was inversely related with Hb levels. Furthermore, there was an inverse link between proteinuria and FMD. However, further analysis of this association showed that the FMD-proteinuria link was confined to patients with proteinuria exceeding 150 mg/d, while no such association existed in patients with proteinuria <150 mg/d. Adjustment of the Hb-FMD relationship for pertinent Framingham risk factors, proteinuria, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and GFR levels had a modest influence on this association, which remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial function is inversely associated with Hb levels in diabetic patients with stage 1 to 2 CKD, and proteinuria is an effect modifier of this association. Overall, the observations of this study generate the hypothesis that proteinuria exposes a situation wherein Hb may limit the endothelium-mediated vasoregulation in diabetes.","2010","Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Hemoglobin ( Hb ) is the main carrier and buffer of nitric oxide ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Under such conditions, external administration of human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) is administered as alternative to improve conditions of CKD patients by increasing their hemoglobin (Hb) levels to a given therapeutic range. Presently, EPO dosing strategies extensively depend on packet inserts and on ""average"" responses to the medication from previous patients. Clearly dosage strategies based on these approaches are, at best, nonoptimal to EPO medication and potentially dangerous to patients that do not adhere to the notion of expected ""average"" response. In this work, a technique called semi-blind robust identification is provided to uniquely identify models of the individual patients of anemia based on their actual Hb responses and EPO administration.

This can be challenging with regard to the erythropoiesis-stimulating proteins (ESPs). To ensure access to these products, physicians must be health insurance literate, knowing how different Medicare parts cover the erythropoietin (EPO) products. For example, Medicare Part A places the responsibility for medications on the provider. This means that a long-term care facility is responsible for covering the cost of medications used during the Medicare Part A skilled stay. Medicare Part B covers medications that are provided ""incident to"" a physician service, including injectables provided by physicians in their offices or during dialysis treatments. Managed care plans, which provide coverage under Medicare Part C, are responsible for all of the benefits available under Medicare Parts A and B. The newest Medicare Part is D, the prescription drug benefit introduced in January 2006. Medicare Part D covers most medications administered to residents in a long-term care facility. For the dually eligible-that is, residents covered by both Medicare and Medicaid-the Medicare Part D program replaces Medicaid drug coverage. Unfortunately, the criteria by which these prescription plans choose to cover products such as ESPs are not based on any specific standard but vary greatly by plan as each has the right to determine coverage criteria. In addition to individualized plan criteria, each plan defines its own process for prior authorization, appeals, and exceptions. Understanding the basic rules of coverage is essential to ensuring access to the ESPs for residents with anemia of CKD.","2006","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Sacubitril-valsartan is a novel therapy for the treatment of chronic Heart Failure with a reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF). We have evaluated the short-term effects of sacubitril- valsartan on the anemia of CRS. METHODS: The study group comprised 39 patients with HFrEF, who were followed-up for three months. The study is a retrospective analysis of clinical data. Data of 3 months' and baseline visits were recorded including plasmatic creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, cystatin C, kaliemia, haemoglobin, pro-BNP, and albuminuria. RESULTS: In all, 34 patients ended the follow-up. Mean sacubitril-valsartan dosage at baseline was 101 ± 62 mg/day and 126 ± 59 mg/day at end. Mean hemoglobin increased from 12.2 ± 1.1 g/dl at baseline to 12.9 ± 1.0 g/dl (p = 0.001,). Prevalence of anemia was 64.7% (95%CI, 47.9-78.5%) at baseline and 38.4 (95%CI, 23.9-55.0%) after the follow-up (p = 0.016). Serum cystatin C levels decreased from 2.71 ± 1.0 to 2.48 ± 1.0 mg/l (p = 0.028). Serum K levels remained unchanged (baseline 4.94 ± 0.60, three months visit 4.94 ± 0.61 mmol/l, p = 0.998). CONCLUSION: Sacubitril-valsartan improves anemia in CRS patients. An improvement in serum cystatin levels was observed. Few untoward effects were detected.

","Schmid H. and Jelkmann W.","INTRODUCTION: The main pillars for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated anemia are peptidic erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron preparations. Both approaches benefit from long-term efficacy and safety data but are surrounded by clinical and economic concerns, driving the search for novel anti-anemic drugs. AREAS COVERED: By answering pivotal questions, the authors describe the recent developments of next generation ESAs, introduce cutting-edge iron formulations and focus on investigational approaches that interact with pathways involved in erythropoietin (Epo) synthesis and myeloid hematopoiesis. Finally, the challenges encountered with these drug candidates are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Current peptidic ESAs are effective and well-tolerated, but are costly, require parenteral application and iron supplementation. ESA resistance may develop calling for increased doses. Therefore, orally available hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizing compounds are attractive alternatives, which may be approved in the near future. Prominent compounds are molidustat, daprodustat and roxadustat. HIF stabilizers suppress hepcidin production and improve iron balance as the present ESAs, but also raise safety concerns in association with their pleiotropic actions. Other investigational erythropoietic biologics are growth-differentiation factor-11 (GDF11) ligand traps (sotatercept, luspatercept), which are also well advanced in development. Possibly, they will provide an add-on for established therapies. However, immunogenicity of these compounds still needs to be carefully investigated.","2016","Expert opinion on investigational drugs",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Hörl W.","Iron deficiency is the most common cause of hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Iron deficiency can easily be corrected by intravenous iron administration, which is more effective than oral iron supplementation, at least in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron status can be monitored by different parameters such as ferritin, transferrin saturation, percentage of hypochromic red blood cells, and/or the reticulocyte hemoglobin content, but an increased erythropoietic response to iron supplementation is the most widely accepted reference standard of iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Parenteral iron therapy is not without acute and chronic adverse events. While provocative animal and in vitro studies suggest induction of inflammation, oxidative stress, and kidney damage by available parenteral iron preparations, several recent clinical studies showed the opposite effects as long as intravenous iron was adequately dosed. Thus, within the recommended international guidelines, parenteral iron administration is safe. Intravenous iron therapy should be withheld during acute infection but not during inflammation. The integration of ESA and intravenous iron therapy into anemia management allowed attainment of target hemoglobin values in the majority of pediatric and adult CKD and ESRD patients.","2007","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

PURPOSE: To determine the effect of ESAs on HRQOL at different hemoglobin targets in adults with CKD who were receiving or not receiving dialysis. DATA SOURCES: Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 1 November 2015, supplemented with manual screening. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials that evaluated the treatment of anemia with ESAs, including erythropoietin and darbepoetin, targeted higher versus lower hemoglobin levels, and used validated HRQOL metrics. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics, quality, and data were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Outcome measures were scores on the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), Kidney Dialysis Questionnaire (KDQ), and other tools. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 17 eligible studies, 13 reported SF-36 outcomes and 4 reported KDQ outcomes. Study populations consisted of patients not undergoing dialysis (n = 12), those undergoing dialysis (n = 4), or a mixed sample (n = 1). Only 4 studies had low risk of bias. Pooled analyses showed that higher hemoglobin targets resulted in no statistically or clinically significant differences in SF-36 or KDQ domains. Differences in HRQOL were further attenuated in studies at low risk of bias and in subgroups of dialysis recipients. LIMITATION: Statistically significant heterogeneity among studies, few good-quality studies, and possible publication bias.

Better treatment of CKD and its complications is crucial to reverse this negative trend. Anemia is a frequent complication of CKD and is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. It is a devastating complication of progressive kidney disease, that negatively affects also the quality of life. The prevalence of anemia increases in parallel with CKD progression. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on therapy of renal anemia. Iron therapy, blood transfusions, and erythropoietin stimulating agents are still the mainstay of renal anemia treatment. There are several novel agents on the horizon that might provide therapeutic opportunities in CKD. The potential therapeutic options target the hepcidin-ferroportin axis, which is the master regulator of iron homeostasis, and the BMP-SMAD pathway, which regulates hepcidin expression in the liver. An inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase is a new therapeutic option becoming available for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients. This new class of drugs stimulates the synthesis of endogenous erythropoietin and increases iron availability. We also summarized the effects of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors on iron parameters, including hepcidin, as their action on the hematological parameters. They could be of particular interest in the out-patient population with CKD and patients with ESA hyporesponsiveness. However, current knowledge is limited and still awaits clinical validation.

STUDY DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 149 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin, 9.0-12.0 g/dL; transferrin saturation [TSAT]≤ 30%, serum ferritin ≤ 300 ng/mL), and serum phosphate levels ≥ 4.0 to 6.0mg/dL. Use of intravenous iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was prohibited. INTERVENTION: Randomization to treatment for 12 weeks with ferric citrate coordination complex (ferric citrate) or placebo. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary end points were change in TSAT and serum phosphate level from baseline to end of study. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline to end of treatment in values for ferritin, hemoglobin, intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), urinary phosphate excretion, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: Ferric citrate treatment increased mean TSAT from 22% ± 7% (SD) to 32% ± 14% and reduced serum phosphate levels from 4.5 ± 0.6 to 3.9 ± 0.6 mg/dL, while placebo exerted no effect on TSAT (21% ± 8% to 20% ± 8%) and less effect on serum phosphate level (4.7 ± 0.6 to 4.4 ± 0.8 mg/dL; between-group P<0.001 for each). Ferric citrate increased hemoglobin levels (from 10.5 ± 0.8 to 11.0 ± 1.0 g/dL; P<0.001 vs placebo), reduced urinary phosphate excretion 39% (P<0.001 vs placebo), and reduced serum intact FGF-23 levels from a median of 159 (IQR, 102-289) to 105 (IQR, 65-187) pg/mL (P=0.02 vs placebo).

METHODS: We conducted two randomized, open-label, noninferiority phase 3 trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vadadustat, as compared with darbepoetin alfa, in patients with anemia and incident or prevalent dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD). The primary safety end point, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, a composite of death from any cause, a nonfatal myocardial infarction, or a nonfatal stroke), pooled across the trials (noninferiority margin, 1.25). A key secondary safety end point was the first occurrence of a MACE plus hospitalization for either heart failure or a thromboembolic event. The primary and key secondary efficacy end points were the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to weeks 24 to 36 and from baseline to weeks 40 to 52, respectively, in each trial (noninferiority margin, -0.75 g per deciliter). RESULTS: A total of 3923 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive vadadustat or darbepoetin alfa: 369 in the incident DD-CKD trial and 3554 in the prevalent DD-CKD trial. In the pooled analysis, a first MACE occurred in 355 patients (18.2%) in the vadadustat group and in 377 patients (19.3%) in the darbepoetin alfa group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.11). The mean differences between the groups in the change in hemoglobin concentration were -0.31 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.10) at weeks 24 to 36 and -0.07 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.34 to 0.19) at weeks 40 to 52 in the incident DD-CKD trial and -0.17 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.23 to -0.10) and -0.18 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.25 to -0.12), respectively, in the prevalent DD-CKD trial.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used to estimate the differences in costs between anemic and nonanemic patients. The analysis used administrative claims data (1999-2001) from a US population to assess direct costs and disability and productivity data (1997-2001) to estimate indirect costs. Adult patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer, or congestive heart failure (CHF) were identified. Costs were estimated using a generalized linear model, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and disease severity. The adjustment variables for disease severity were based on ICD-9, HCPCS, or pharmacy codes. These costs were projected to a 1-million-member, similar population. RESULTS: The percentage of anemia patients varied among conditions (6.9-26.1%); the CKD population had the highest prevalence. CKD anemic patients incurred the greatest average annual direct costs ($78,209), followed by CHF ($72,078) and cancer ($60,447). After adjusting for baseline characteristics including severity, the difference in direct costs between anemic and nonanemic patients decreased for all diseases; CHF patients incurred the greatest adjusted cost difference between anemic and nonanemic ($29,511), followed by CKD ($20,529) and cancer ($18,418). Unmeasured severity and coding bias may account for a portion of the differences in the adjusted cost. CONCLUSION: Anemia may substantially increase health-care costs at a level that is economically very relevant, despite the fact that these patients may comprise only one tenth of the overall anemic population.","2005","Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research"," OBJECTIVE : To examine the economic impact of patients with anemia in selected diseases ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Clement F. et al.","BACKGROUND: Treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) is commonplace. The optimal hemoglobin treatment target has not been established. A clearer understanding of the health-related quality of life (HQOL) impact of hemoglobin target levels is needed. We systematically reviewed the randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on HQOL for patients treated with low to intermediate (9.0-12.0 g/dL) and high hemoglobin target levels (>12.0 g/dL) and performed a meta-analysis of all available 36-item short-form (SF-36) RCT data. METHODS: We conducted a search to identify all RCTs of ESA therapy in patients with anemia associated with CKD (1966-December 2006). Inclusion criteria were (1) 30 or more participants, (2) anemic adults with CKD, (3) epoetin (alfa and beta) or darbepoetin used, (4) a control arm, and (5) reported HQOL using a validated measure. All available SF-36 data underwent meta-analysis using the weighted mean difference. RESULTS: Of 231 full texts screened, 11 eligible studies were identified. The SF-36 was used in 9 trials. Reporting of these data was generally incomplete. Data from each domain of the SF-36 were summarized. Statistically significant changes were noted in the physical function (weighted mean difference [WMD], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 4.5), general health (WMD, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.2), social function (WMD, 1.3; 95% CI, -0.8 to 3.4), and mental health (WMD, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.8) domains. None of the changes would be considered clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that targeting hemoglobin levels in excess of 12.0 g/dL leads to small and not clinically meaningful improvements in HQOL. This, in addition to significant safety concerns, suggests that targeting treatment to hemoglobin levels that are in the range of 9.0 to 12.0 g/dL is preferred.","2009","Archives of internal medicine",,"Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: Patients enrolled in the 1517-CL-0310 study (NCT02988973) that demonstrated noninferiority of roxadustat to DA for change in average hemoglobin levels of week 18-24 from baseline who had used human recombinant erythropoietin or DA before conversion and who were randomized to either roxadustat or DA were included. The endpoints were the average allocated dose of roxadustat and DA per administration in the last 6 weeks (AAD/6W), assessed by subgroups known to be associated with ESA hyporesponsiveness. The analysis of variance was performed by the treatment group to test the influence of subgroup factors on the AAD/6W of study drug. The ratios between the mean AAD/6W in each subgroup category and the within-arm mean AAD/6W were calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-two patients were randomized to either the roxadustat or DA comparative group and received treatment (roxadustat, n = 131; DA, n = 131). Higher mean (standard deviation) doses of both roxadustat (63.15 [24.84] mg) and DA (47.33 [29.79] μg) were required in the highest ESA resistance index (≥6.8) quartile (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with adequate iron repletion had the lowest doses for both roxadustat (45.54 [18.01] mg) and DA (28.13 [20.98] μg). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥28.57 nmol/L and the estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 were associated with requiring higher DA but not roxadustat doses.

","Park M. et al.","Renal anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), associated with decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO) due to loss of kidney function, and subsequent decreased red blood cell (RBC) production. However, many other factors play a critical role in the development of renal anemia, such as iron deficiency, inflammation, and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels. We previously reported that inhibition of FGF23 signaling rescues anemia in mice with CKD. In the present study we sought to investigate whether α-Klotho deficiency present in CKD also contributes to the development of renal anemia. To address this, we administered α-Klotho to mice with CKD induced by an adenine-rich diet. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after α-Klotho injection, and blood and organs were collected immediately post-mortem. Our data show that α-Klotho administration had no beneficial effect in mice with CKD-associated anemia as it did not increase RBC numbers and hemoglobin levels, and it did not stimulate EPO secretion. Moreover, α-Klotho did not improve iron deficiency and inflammation in CKD as it had no effect on iron levels or inflammatory markers. Interestingly, Klotho supplementation significantly reduced the number of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow and downregulated renal Epo and Hif2α mRNA in mice fed control diet resulting in reduced circulating EPO levels in these mice. In addition, Klotho significantly decreased intestinal absorption of iron in control mice leading to reduced serum iron and transferrin saturation levels. Our findings demonstrate that α-Klotho does not have a direct role in renal anemia and that FGF23 suppresses erythropoiesis in CKD via a Klotho-independent mechanism. However, in physiological conditions α-Klotho appears to have an inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis and iron regulation.","2022","Frontiers in pediatrics"," In the present study we sought to investigate whether α-Klotho deficiency present in CKD also contributes to the development of renal anemia ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

However, in patients with CKD, treating anemia to a target of normal hemoglobin has been associated with increased risk of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. We investigated the association between preoperative hemoglobin and outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients with CKD and assessed whether there was a level of preoperative hemoglobin below which the incidence of adverse surgical outcomes increases. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This prospective observational study included adult patients with CKD stages 3-5 (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) undergoing cardiac surgery from February 2000 to January 2010. Patients were classified into four groups stratified by preoperative hemoglobin level: <10, 10-11.9, 12-13.9, and ≥ 14 g/dl. The outcomes were postoperative AKI requiring dialysis, sepsis, cerebrovascular accident, and mortality. RESULTS: In total, 788 patients with a mean eGFR of 43.5 ± 3.7 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were evaluated, of whom 22.5% had preoperative hemoglobin within the normal range (men: 14-18 g/dl; women: 12-16 g/dl). Univariate analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the incidence of all adverse postoperative outcomes and hemoglobin level. Using hemoglobin as a continuous variable, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a proportionally greater frequency of all adverse postoperative outcomes per 1-g/dl decrement of preoperative hemoglobin (mortality: odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.57; P<0.001; sepsis: odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.49; P<0.001; cerebrovascular accident: odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.67; P=0.03; postoperative hemodialysis: odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.75; P<0.01). Moreover, preoperative hemoglobin<12 g/dl was an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 7.3; P=0.04).

In another experiment, the anemic rats were treated rhEPO (5 ​μg/kg) for two weeks and then desidustat (15 ​mg/kg) for the next two weeks. Dosing of rhEPO was thrice a week, and for desidustat, it was on alternate days. Desidustat inhibited EPO-resistance caused by rhEPO treatment, decreased hepcidin, IL-6, IL-1β, and increased iron and liver ferroportin. Desidustat reduced EPO requirement and anti-EPO antibodies.

","Kimura T. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Although early intervention for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal anemia are desirable, these conditions are often asymptomatic during their early stages and may be underdiagnosed. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed Japanese administrative claims data for general and hospital populations. The data period for the general and hospital data ranged from January 2011 to December 2016 and from April 2008 to July 2017, respectively. CKD stage was determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Anemia was defined per Japanese guidelines using hemoglobin (Hb) values. The proportion of patients who had eGFR-defined stages G3-G5 CKD without a CKD diagnosis, and Hb-defined anemia without an anemia diagnosis or treatment records, was estimated. RESULTS: Among 16,779 (general) and 68,161 (hospital) patients, a high proportion of G3 CKD patients did not have a CKD-related diagnosis (general: G3a, 95.0%; G3b, 68.4%; hospital: G3a, 89.2%; G3b, 67.9%); however, some patients were treated with antihypertensives. Among anemic patients, 75.7% (G3a) and 66.7% (G3b) of the general population, and 56.2% (G3a) and 47.5% (G3b) of the hospital population, did not have an anemia-related diagnosis or treatment. CKD and anemia were more likely to be diagnosed in patients with G4 and G5 CKD. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of G3 CKD patients did not have a CKD-related diagnosis. Likewise, many anemic patients with G3 CKD did not have an anemia-related diagnosis. Despite the lack of a CKD-related diagnosis, some patients received appropriate treatment (e.g., antihypertensives).

METHODS: Physical and laboratory examinations were performed 120 days before initiating dialysis in p-CKDs (baseline). To evaluate the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) after starting dialysis, the mean hemoglobin (Hb) was defined as the average at the start of dialysis and 6 months after starting dialysis. Changes in the LVMI were observed in three groups according to mean Hb levels (Hb < 10.1, 10.1 < Hb < 11.0, and Hb > 11.0 g/dL for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). LVMI was evaluated using echocardiography at the pre-dialysis, initiation, and maintenance dialysis periods. RESULTS: A lower LVMI at dialysis initiation and an improvement in LVMI were detected in the highest tertile group of mean Hb (11.0 g/dl). Consequently, in the high Hb group (Hb level > 11.0 g/dl), LVMI remained low from dialysis initiation until after 6 months.The relationship between Hb and LVMI was not significant; however, a constant correlation with β ≥ 0.4 in the absolute value was maintained. CONCLUSION: L-ESAs may correlate with Hb and LVMI after administration, independent of the baseline LVMI and Hb values. These findings have therapeutic implications in the treatment strategies for p-CKDs during the pre-dialysis to maintenance dialysis period.","2023","BMC nephrology"," This study aimed to determine whether treatment using long-acting erythropoietin-stimulating agents ( L-ESAs ) is independently associated with LVH during the pre-dialysis to maintenance dialysis period in p-CKDs ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Hsu H. et al.","INTRODUCTION: It remains unclear why the optimal haemoglobin target is lower in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in non-CKD persons. Arteriosclerosis and consequent impaired arterial function comprise a central cardiovascular risk mechanism in CKD. We hypothesized that the optimal haemoglobin target depends on its opposing effects on arterial stiffness and pressure pulsatility in CKD. METHODS: Arterial stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity), wave reflection (augmentation index, reflected wave pressure and reflection magnitude), and pressure pulsatility (central systolic and pulse pressure, peripheral pulse pressure, pressure amplification and forward wave pressure) were assessed in 48 dialysis patients. RESULTS: In established confounder and diabetes adjusted linear regression models, haemoglobin levels were directly associated with arterial stiffness (partial R=0.366, p=0.03) and inversely with central systolic pressure (partial R=-0.344, p=0.04), central pulse pressure (partial R=-0.403, p=0.01), peripheral pulse pressure (partial R=-0.521, p=0.001) and forward wave pressure (partial R=-0.544, p=0.001). The presence of heart failure and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and erythropoietin stimulating agents did not materially alter these relationships upon further adjustment for the respective characteristics in the models, and in sensitivity analyses. In receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, the optimal haemoglobin concentration cut-off values in predicting arterial stiffness and increased central pulse pressure were remarkably similar at 10.95 g/dl and 10.85 g/dl, respectively, and with clinically useful sensitivities, specificities and positive and negative predictive values. In logistic regression models, a haemoglobin value of >10.9 mg/dl was associated with both arterial stiffness (>10 m/sec; OR (95% CI) = 10.48 (1.57-70.08), p=0.02) and normal central pulse pressure (>50 mmHg; OR (95% CI) = 7.55 (1.58-36.03), p=0.01). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the optimal haemoglobin target in dialysis patients is ~11g/dl and determined by its differential and contrasting effects on arterial stiffness and pressure pulsatility.","2020","International journal of nephrology and renovascular disease",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

OBJECTIVES: To assess--in relation to New York Heart Association class--the prevalence of anemia and chronic kidney disease in patients with normal serum creatinine in a cohort of 526 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. METHODS: GFR was estimated using the simplified MDRD formula, the Cockcroft-Gault formula, the Jeliffe and the novel CKD-EPI formula. RESULTS: According to the WHO definition the prevalence of anemia in our study was 21%. We observed a progressive decline in GFR and hemoglobin concentration together with a rise in NYHA class. Significant correlations were observed between eGFR and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, age, NYHA class, complications of PCI, including bleeding, and major adverse cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anemia and chronic kidney disease is high in patients undergoing PCI despite normal serum creatinine, particularly in higher NYHA class. Lower eGFR and hemoglobin are associated with more complications, including bleeding after PCI and higher prevalence of major adverse cardiac events. In patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, GFR should be estimated since renal dysfunction and subsequent anemia are important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","2010","The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ"," OBJECTIVES : To assess--in relation to New York Heart Association class--the prevalence of anemia and chronic kidney disease in patients with normal serum creatinine in a cohort of 526 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Here, we evaluated the role of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). In 54 patients with advanced CKD, erythrocyte but not plasma ADMA levels independently associated with low hemoglobin values, although levels of both types of ADMA were elevated compared with those in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, erythrocyte ADMA level associated with the erythropoietin resistance index in patients receiving a weekly injected dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents standardized for hemoglobin levels and body weight, whereas it correlated with the erythropoietin demand index (plasma erythropoietin units divided by the hemoglobin value) in patients not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Compared with sham-operated controls, wild-type mice with 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (Nx), a remnant kidney model with advanced CKD, had decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume values but increased erythrocyte and plasma ADMA and plasma erythropoietin levels. In comparison, dimethylarginine dimethlaminohydrolase-1 transgenic (DDAH-1 Tg) mice, which efficiently metabolized ADMA, had significant improvements in all of the values except those for erythropoietin after 5/6 Nx. Additionally, wild-type Nx mice, but not DDAH-1 Tg Nx mice, had reduced splenic gene expression of erythropoietin receptor and erythroferrone, which regulates iron metabolism in response to erythropoietin.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anemia and its association with renal disease among diabetic adult outpatients attending a hospital in Northeast Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 412 diabetic adults at the diabetes clinic of Dessie Referral hospital in Northeast Ethiopia, from January to April 2018. Each patient provided a blood sample for hemoglobin and serum creatinine levels and urine for albuminuria. Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria (<13 g/dl for men and <12 g/dl for women). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was classified into 5 stages based on the eGFR and albuminuria. RESULTS: Anemia was present in 26.7% of the participants, and CKD in 43.0%. Anemia was more prevalent in patients with CKD (39.5%) than those without CKD (17.0%; P < 0.001). The prevalence of anemia increased with stage of CKD, from 22.6% at stage 1 to 100% at stage 4.

","Babitt J. and Lin H.","Anemia is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with lower quality of life and higher risk of adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and death. Anemia management in patients with CKD currently revolves around the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and supplemental iron. However, many patients do not respond adequately and/or require high doses of these medications. Furthermore, recent clinical trials have shown that targeting higher hemoglobin levels with conventional therapies leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly when higher doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are used and in patients who are poorly responsive to therapy. One explanation for the poor response to conventional therapies in some patients is that these treatments do not fully address the underlying cause of the anemia. In many patients with CKD, as with patients with other chronic inflammatory diseases, poor absorption of dietary iron and the inability to use the body's iron stores contribute to the anemia. Recent research suggests that these abnormalities in iron balance may be caused by increased levels of the key iron regulatory hormone hepcidin.

METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to achieve high (13 to 15 g/dL [130 to 150 g/L]) or low (11 to 12 g/dL [110 to 120 g/L]) hemoglobin-level targets during 4 months of stabilization, followed by 36 months of maintenance. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease was measured by using iohexol clearance. Quality of life, nutrition, and safety also were monitored. RESULTS: Because of labeling changes for subcutaneous administration of epoetin alfa (Eprex; Johnson and Johnson, Schaffhausen, Switzerland), the study was terminated prematurely. There were 195 patients enrolled in each group; 108 high-hemoglobin and 133 low-hemoglobin patients entered the maintenance phase. Mean maintenance duration was 7.4 months for the high-hemoglobin group and 8.3 months for the low-hemoglobin group. GFR decrease was numerically, but not statistically significantly, lower with the high-hemoglobin group (0.058 versus 0.081 mL/min/1.73 m2/mo [< 0.01 mL/s/1.73 m2/mo]). Physical quality-of-life measures showed trends (Role-Physical, P = 0.055; Physical Function, P = 0.083) or statistically significant improvement (Vitality, P = 0.042) with high hemoglobin levels at the end of the stabilization phase.

However, the effect of ID on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population is unknown. We analyzed data from a multinational cohort of NDD-CKD Stages 3-5 patients to test the association between transferrin saturation (TSAT) index and ferritin with HRQoL. METHODS: Patients from Brazil (n = 205), France (n = 2015) and the USA (n = 293) in the Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (CKDopps, 2013-2019) were included. We evaluated the association of TSAT and ferritin (and functional and absolute ID, defined as TSAT ≤20% and ferritin ≥300 or <50 ng/mL) on pre-specified HRQoL measures, including the 36-item Kidney Disease Quality of Life physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) as the primary outcomes. Models were adjusted for confounders including hemoglobin (Hb). RESULTS: TSAT ≤15% and ferritin <50 ng/mL and ≥300 ng/mL were associated with worse PCS scores, but not with MCS. Patients with composite TSAT ≤20% and ferritin <50 or ≥300 ng/mL had lower functional status and worse PCS scores than those with a TSAT of 20-30% and ferritin 50-299 ng/mL. Patients with a lower TSAT were less likely to perform intense physical activity. Adjustment for Hb only slightly attenuated the observed effects. CONCLUSIONS: Low TSAT levels, as well as both low TSAT with low ferritin and low TSAT with high ferritin, are associated with worse physical HRQoL in NDD-CKD patients, even after accounting for Hb level.

It could have direct protective effects on tubular cells through its antiapoptotic properties. It could help maintain the integrity of the interstitial capillary network through its effects on endothelial cells. Thus, suggesting that correcting anemia with ESA could slow the progression of CKD is biologically plausible. In patients with CKD, three small prospective studies and a retrospective study have suggested that treatment with ESA may have protective effects. Post-hoc analysis of the Reduction in Endpoints in Noninsulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan study has also shown that anemia was an independent risk factor for progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, a large clinical trial, which had to be stopped prematurely because of labeling change for subcutaneous administration of epoetin alfa, suggests that complete normalization of hemoglobin levels is safe in CKD patients not on dialysis and without severe cardiovascular disease.

As the prevalence of end-stage renal disease continues to rise, the management of anemia represents a growing economic burden. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) are the mainstay of anemia management but their use is limited due to the associated cardiovascular adverse events. Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme (PHD) inhibitors are a new class of drugs that stabilize the hypoxia-inducible factors and are under clinical investigation for the treatment of renal anemia. The advantages of PHD inhibitors include the oral route of administration, improved iron profile, restoration of diurnal rhythm of erythropoietin secretion, and endogenous erythropoietin production near physiological range. Emerging but limited data indicates a small blood pressure lowering effect of PHD inhibitors.

METHODS: In this phase 2, double-blind, 24-week study, NDD-CKD patients were randomized to oral placebo or roxadustat (50, 70, or 100 mg) three times weekly (TIW) for 6 weeks followed by dose adjustments to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) at 10-12 g/dL for 18 weeks; patients meeting pre-defined criteria were re-randomized to TIW or once-weekly dosing. The primary end point was rate of rise of Hb (g/dL/week) during the first 6 weeks; secondary end points included response rate (Hb ≥ 10.0 g/dL and increase in Hb from baseline ≥ 1 g/dL) and mean Hb and change from baseline in Hb at weeks 18-24. The main safety outcomes were vital signs, laboratory test results, electrocardiograms, and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Of 107 patients randomized, 83 completed the study. The mean (SD) rate of rise of Hb during the first 6 weeks was - 0.052 (0.142) for placebo and + 0.200 (0.160), + 0.453 (0.256), and + 0.570 (0.240) for roxadustat 50-, 70-, and 100-mg TIW groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Response rate was 14.8% for placebo and 81.5%, 100%, and 100% for roxadustat TIW groups (p < 0.001). Change in Hb from baseline at weeks 18-24 was - 0.17 (0.61) for placebo and + 1.10 (0.71), + 1.33 (0.82), and + 1.55 (0.88) g/dL for roxadustat TIW groups (p < 0.001).

,"24867675"," Coupling fibroblast growth factor 23 production and cleavage: iron deficiency, rickets, and kidney disease. ","Wolf M. and White K.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: High levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) cause the rare disorders of hypophosphatemic rickets and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite major advances in understanding FGF23 biology, fundamental aspects of FGF23 regulation in health and in CKD remain mostly unknown. RECENT FINDINGS: Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in FGF23 that prevent its proteolytic cleavage, but affected individuals experience a waxing and waning course of phosphate wasting. This led to the discovery that iron deficiency is an environmental trigger that stimulates FGF23 expression and hypophosphatemia in ADHR. Unlike osteocytes in ADHR, normal osteocytes couple increased FGF23 production with commensurately increased FGF23 cleavage to ensure that normal phosphate homeostasis is maintained in the event of iron deficiency. Simultaneous measurement of FGF23 by intact and C-terminal assays supported these breakthroughs by providing minimally invasive insight into FGF23 production and cleavage in bone. These findings also suggest a novel mechanism of FGF23 elevation in patients with CKD, who are often iron deficient and demonstrate increased FGF23 production and decreased FGF23 cleavage, consistent with an acquired state that mimics the molecular pathophysiology of ADHR. SUMMARY: Iron deficiency stimulates FGF23 production, but normal osteocytes couple increased FGF23 production with increased cleavage to maintain normal circulating levels of biologically active hormone. These findings uncover a second level of FGF23 regulation within osteocytes, failure of which culminates in elevated levels of biologically active FGF23 in ADHR and perhaps CKD.","2014","Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : High levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) cause the rare disorders of hypophosphatemic rickets and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Khoury A. et al.","OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ferric maltol (FM), an oral iron formulation, for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE (January 1, 1985, to June 19, 2020) literature search was performed using the terms ferric maltol, accrufer, feraccru, iron maltol, ferric trimaltol, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic kidney disease. Additional data sources included prescribing information, abstracts, and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: English language literature evaluating FM pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in the treatment of IDA were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: FM is a ferric, non-salt-based oral iron formulation demonstrating improved tolerance in patients with previous intolerance to other iron formulations. Phase 3 trials demonstrated significant improvements in anemia and serum iron parameters in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Common adverse effects were gastrointestinal intolerance. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: FM is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to oral iron salts for patients with IBD or CKD and IDA. Emerging data suggest that FM is noninferior to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose in patients with IBD and IDA. Prior to selecting FM over IV iron products, consideration should be given to time to normalization of Hb, ease of administration, cost, and tolerability. CONCLUSION: FM is a relatively safe, effective oral iron therapy that may be better tolerated than other oral iron formulations.

METHODOLOGY: Adult diabetic patients first diagnosed as having anemia upon hospital admission during the specified duration were included. Patients with active bleed, acute renal impairment, critical illness, pregnancy and previously diagnosed anemia were excluded. Etiology and risk factors of anemia were determined in each case on the basis of history, clinical findings and relevant laboratory investigations i.e. complete blood picture, red cell indices, iron profile, renal function tests, urine and stool examination. Association of anemia was determined using chi-square and t-tests with p-value < 0.05 taken as significant. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty patients (34 males and 96 females) were included.

METHODS: We evaluated the association of anemia (defined using World Health Organization criteria of hemoglobin <12 g/dL in women and <13 g/dL in men) with incident ESRD and all-cause death in individuals with CKD using data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Marginal structural models were used to account for time-dependent confounding. RESULTS: Among 3919 participants, 1859 (47.4%) had anemia at baseline. Over median follow up of 7.8 years, we observed 1,010 ESRD events and 994 deaths. In multivariable analyses, individuals with anemia had higher risk for ESRD compared to those without (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.11). In stratified analyses, the increased risk for incident ESRD with anemia was observed in males (HR 2.15, 95% CI: 1.53-3.02) but not females (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.82-1.78.

Roxadustat is the only oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) that has been proved effective to treat renal anemia. However, effects of roxadustat on non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) have yet to be supported by evidence-based medicine. METHODS: Based on the databases of PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science by 12 April 2019 (CRD42019133225), a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on roxadustat for treatment of NDD-CKD was conducted. Primary outcomes were parameters of hemoglobin (Hb) and Hb response. Secondary outcomes were hepcidin, ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TAST), incidences of diarrhea, adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs). The risk of bias and the quality of evidence were assessed, respectively. Both continuous and binary variables were analyzed by the random effects models. Sensitivity analyses were performed when a significant heterogeneity was observed (P<0.1 and I(2)>50%). RESULTS: Finally, three studies with a total of 214 subjects in the roxadustat group and 80 subjects in the placebo group were enrolled.

To determine whether postrandomization blood pressure, hemoglobin level, platelet count, or treatment dose were responsible for the increased risk related to darbepoetin alfa, we performed a nested case-control analysis (1:10 matching) identifying nonstroke controls with propensity matching. The risk of stroke was doubled with darbepoetin alfa. Overall, 154 patients had a stroke, 101/2012 (5.0%) in the darbepoetin alfa arm and 53/2026 (2.6%) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.7). Independent predictors of stroke included assignment to darbepoetin alfa (odds ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.9), history of stroke (odds ratio 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.9), more proteinuria, and known cardiovascular disease. In patients assigned to darbepoetin alfa, postrandomization systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and darbepoetin alfa dose did not differ between those with and without stroke. Additional sensitivity analyses using maximal values, latest values, or changes over varying periods of exposure yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-fold increase in stroke with darbepoetin alfa in TREAT could not be attributed to any baseline characteristic or to postrandomization blood pressure, hemoglobin, platelet count, or dose of treatment. These readily identifiable factors could not be used to mitigate the risk of darbepoetin alfa-related stroke. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

","Schmid H.","INTRODUCTION: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are the mainstay of treatment in anemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. A tailored ESA therapy should combine maximal efficacy and safety with greatest convenience in dosing. Peginesatide, recently approved in the US for once-monthly dosing in adult patients on dialysis, is a promising novel PEGylated erythropoietin-mimetic peptide for the treatment of renal disease-induced anemia. AREAS COVERED: Published animal and human studies that evaluated the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of peginesatide were critically analyzed. EXPERT OPINION: Peginesatide has a well-studied pharmacological and immunological profile, and latest published data favor the use of peginesatide in place of epoetin in dialysis patients. A more detailed evaluation of its safety profile particularly in trials with CKD patients not requiring dialysis is urgently needed, as peginesatide could be a perfect treatment solution for these patients. In addition, clinical long-term data and results from supplemental studies, e.g., with the PEGylated continuous erythropoietin receptor activator as comparator, should briefly follow. The fate of peginesatide on the highly competitive ESA market is currently not predictable and depends on safety and efficacy results of upcoming trials as well as finally on market and price policy.","2013","Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Bissonnette M. et al.","Sickle cell nephropathy is a common complication in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies. In these disorders, polymerization of mutated hemoglobin S results in deformation of red blood cells, which can cause endothelial cell injury in the kidney that may lead to thrombus formation when severe or manifest by multilayering of the basement membranes (glomerular and/or peritubular capillaries) in milder forms of injury. As the injury progresses, the subsequent ischemia, tubular dysfunction, and glomerular scarring can result in CKD or ESRD. Sickle cell nephropathy can occur in patients with homozygous hemoglobin SS or heterozygous hemoglobin S (hemoglobin SC, hemoglobin S/β(0)-thalassemia, and hemoglobin S/β(+)-thalassemia). Clinical manifestations resulting from hemoglobin S polymerization are often milder in patients with heterozygous hemoglobin S. These patients may not present with clinically apparent acute sickle cell crises, but these milder forms can provide a unique view of the kidney injury in sickle cell disease. Here, we report a patient with hemoglobin SC disease who showed peritubular capillary and vasa recta thrombi and capillary basement membrane alterations primarily involving the renal medulla.

","Singh A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the use of recombinant human erythropoietin and its derivatives for the treatment of anemia has been linked to a possibly increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and other adverse events. Several trials have suggested that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHIs) are as effective as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in increasing hemoglobin levels. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned patients with CKD who were undergoing dialysis and who had a hemoglobin level of 8.0 to 11.5 g per deciliter to receive an oral HIF-PHI (daprodustat) or an injectable ESA (epoetin alfa if they were receiving hemodialysis or darbepoetin alfa if they were receiving peritoneal dialysis). The two primary outcomes were the mean change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 (noninferiority margin, -0.75 g per deciliter) and the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), with a noninferiority margin of 1.25. RESULTS: A total of 2964 patients underwent randomization. The mean (±SD) baseline hemoglobin level was 10.4±1.0 g per deciliter overall. The mean (±SE) change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 was 0.28±0.02 g per deciliter in the daprodustat group and 0.10±0.02 g per deciliter in the ESA group (difference, 0.18 g per deciliter; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12 to 0.24), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.75 g per deciliter. During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, a major adverse cardiovascular event occurred in 374 of 1487 patients (25.2%) in the daprodustat group and in 394 of 1477 (26.7%) in the ESA group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.07), which also met the prespecified noninferiority margin for daprodustat. The percentages of patients with other adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD undergoing dialysis, daprodustat was noninferior to ESAs regarding the change in the hemoglobin level from baseline and cardiovascular outcomes.

METHOD: A cross-sectional analysis of 594 adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (TSI) people in good health or with diabetes and markers of CKD. Measures included urine albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), haemoglobin (Hb) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Diabetes was defined by medical history, medications or HbA1c≥6.5% or ≥48mmol/mol. Anaemia was defined as Hb<130g/L or <120g/L in males and females respectively. A multivariate regression analysis examining factors independently associated with log-bilirubin was performed. RESULTS: Participants mean (SD) age was 45.1 (14.5) years, and included 62.5% females, 71.7% Aboriginal, 41.1% with diabetes, 16.7% with anaemia, 41% with ACR>3mg/mmol and 18.2% with eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m(2).

","Chalhoub S. et al.","PATIENT GROUP: It is estimated that 15-30% of geriatric cats will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), and that 30-65% of these cats will develop anemia as their renal disease worsens. Anemia of renal disease is multifactorial in its pathogenesis, but the main cause is reduced production of erythropoietin, a renal hormone that controls the bone marrow's production of red blood cells, as kidney disease progresses. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: It is important to recognize the presence of anemia of renal disease so that adequate treatment may be instituted to improve quality of life and metabolic function. Erythrocyte-stimulating agents (ESAs), such as epoetin alfa, epoetin beta and darbepoetin alfa, have been developed to counteract the effects of decreased erythropoietin production by the kidneys. These treatments, which are the focus of this review, have 83% similarity in amino acid sequence to the feline hormone. On average, the target packed cell volume (>25%) is reached within 3-4 weeks of ESA therapy. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: The use of ESAs has been associated with a number of complications, such as iron deficiency, hypertension, arthralgia, fever, seizures, polycythemia and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Darbepoetin has a prolonged half-life compared with epoetin and thus can be given only once a week, instead of three times a week. The incidence of PRCA appears to be decreased with darbepoetin use when compared with epoetin use in cats.

FGF23 is a bone-derived hormone that is essential for regulating vitamin D and phosphate homeostasis. In the early stages of CKD, serum FGF23 levels rise 1000-fold above normal values in an attempt to maintain normal phosphate levels. Despite this compensatory action, clinical CKD studies have demonstrated powerful and dose-dependent associations between FGF23 levels and higher risks for mortality. A prospective pathomechanism coupling elevated serum FGF23 levels with CKD-associated anemia and cardiovascular injury is its strong association with chronic inflammation.

METHODS: In two phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, noninferiority trials, we compared vadadustat with the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) darbepoetin alfa in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) not previously treated with an ESA who had a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g per deciliter and in patients with ESA-treated NDD-CKD and a hemoglobin concentration of 8 to 11 g per deciliter (in the United States) or 9 to 12 g per deciliter (in other countries). The primary safety end point, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was the first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), pooled across the two trials. Secondary safety end points included expanded MACE (MACE plus hospitalization for either heart failure or a thromboembolic event). The primary and key secondary efficacy end points in each trial were the mean change in hemoglobin concentration from baseline during two evaluation periods: weeks 24 through 36 and weeks 40 through 52. RESULTS: A total of 1751 patients with ESA-untreated NDD-CKD and 1725 with ESA-treated NDD-CKD underwent randomization in the two trials. In the pooled analysis, in which 1739 patients received vadadustat and 1732 received darbepoetin alfa, the hazard ratio for MACE was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.36), which did not meet the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25. The mean between-group differences in the change in the hemoglobin concentration at weeks 24 through 36 were 0.05 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.04 to 0.15) in the trial involving ESA-untreated patients and -0.01 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.07) in the trial involving ESA-treated patients, which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.75 g per deciliter. CONCLUSIONS: Vadadustat, as compared with darbepoetin alfa, met the prespecified noninferiority criterion for hematologic efficacy but not the prespecified noninferiority criterion for cardiovascular safety in patients with NDD-CKD.

Anemia is one of the laboratory and clinical findings of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). The presence of anemia in patients with CKD has a wide range of clinically important consequences. Some of the symptoms that were previously attributed to reduced renal function are, in fact, a consequence of anemia. Anemia contributes to increased cardiac output, the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, angina, and congestive heart failure. According to current knowledge, anemia also contributes to the progression of CKD and is one of the factors that contribute to the high morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic renal failure and their reduced survival. METHODS: MEDLINE search was performed to collect both original and review articles addressing anemia in CKD, pathophysiology of renal anemia, erythropoiesis, erythropoietin, iron metabolism, inflammation, malnutrition, drugs, renal replacement therapy and anemia management CONCLUSION: The present review summarized current knowledge in the field of the pathophysiology of renel anemia. Understanding the pathophysiology of anemia in CKD is crucial for the optimal treatment of anemia according to recent clinical practice guidelines and recommendation, and correct recognition of causes of resistence to treatment of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA).","2015","Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Findings on the association between posttransplant anemia (PTA) and mortality in posttransplant patients are scarce. This study explored whether PTA shortly after kidney transplantation (KT) predicts mortality at up to 10 years' follow-up, stratified for chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. Methods. PTA was divided into 3 categories according to the hemoglobin (Hb) value: severe (Hb < 10 g/dl), mild (10.0 g/dl ≤ Hb < 11.9 g/dl), or no PTA (Hb ≥ 12 g/dl). CKD stages were estimated using the CKD-EPI formula and divided into 2 groups: CKD1-2 and CKD3-5. Cox regression, stratified according to CKD, was performed to identify whether different categories of PTA predicted mortality in KT recipients. Results. Age, being female, and both mild and severe PTA contributed significantly to the Cox regression model on mortality in CKD1-2. In the Cox regression model for mortality in CKD3-5, age and severe PTA contributed significantly to this model. Conclusion. PTA shortly after KT increased the risk of mortality at up to 10 years' follow-up. Even mild PTA is associated with a 6-fold higher risk of mortality and severe PTA with a 10-fold higher risk of mortality in CKD1-2. Clinical evaluation and treatment of anemia might reduce the higher risk of mortality in patients with PTA in early stages of CKD after KT.","2017","BioMed research international",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Pappa M. et al.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is currently considered a modern global epidemic, and diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anemia is one of the most significant complications of CKD, and it is mainly attributed to insufficient erythropoietin (EPO) production. However, anemia develops earlier in the course of CKD among patients with DM, and the severity of anemia tends to be more marked in these patients compared to nondiabetic subjects, regardless of the stage of CKD. In this review, we focus on the ""less known"" complex interacting mechanisms which are involved in the pathophysiology of anemia associated with DN. Although the major cause of anemia in DN is considered to be an inappropriate response of the plasma EPO concentration to anemia, several other possible mechanisms have been suggested. Glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, renal tubular dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis are among the main culprits. On the other hand, systemic effects such as chronic inflammation, autonomic neuropathy and the renin-angiotensin system are also involved. Finally, several medications are considered to aggravate anemia associated with DN. Since anemia is an important predictor of quality of life and is implicated in the increased burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, further research is required to elucidate its pathogenesis in diabetic patients.","2015","International urology and nephrology",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Roxadustat (FG-4592) is an orally bioavailable hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that promotes coordinated erythropoiesis through HIF-mediated transcription. We performed an open-label, randomized hemoglobin (Hb) correction study in anemic (Hb≤10.0 g/dl) patients incident to hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Sixty patients received no iron, oral iron, or IV iron while treated with roxadustat for 12 weeks. Mean±SD baseline Hb was 8.3±1.0 g/dl in enrolled patients. Roxadustat at titrated doses increased mean Hb by ≥2.0 g/dl within 7 weeks regardless of baseline iron repletion status, C-reactive protein level, iron regimen, or dialysis modality. Mean±SEM maximal change in Hb from baseline (ΔHb(max)), the primary endpoint, was 3.1±0.2 g/dl over 12 weeks in efficacy-evaluable patients (n=55). In groups receiving oral or IV iron, ΔHb(max) was similar and larger than in the no-iron group. Hb response (increase in Hb of ≥1.0 g/dl from baseline) was achieved in 96% of efficacy-evaluable patients. Mean serum hepcidin decreased significantly 4 weeks into study: by 80% in HD patients receiving no iron (n=22), 52% in HD and PD patients receiving oral iron (n=21), and 41% in HD patients receiving IV iron (n=9). In summary, roxadustat was well tolerated and corrected anemia in incident HD and PD patients, regardless of baseline iron repletion status or C-reactive protein level and with oral or IV iron supplementation; it also reduced serum hepcidin levels.","2016","Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

One of the larger trials to study the effects of complete correction of anemia in stages 3 to 4 CKD was the Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta (CREATE) trial. Here, we analyzed echocardiographic data from CREATE to determine the prevalence, dynamics, and prognostic implications of abnormal LV geometry in patients who were treated to different Hb targets. The prevalence of LVH at baseline was 47%, with eccentric LVH more frequent than concentric. During the study, LVH prevalence and mean left ventricular mass index did not change significantly, but LV geometry fluctuated considerably within 2 yr in both groups. CV event-free survival was significantly worse in the presence of concentric LVH and eccentric LVH compared with the absence of LVH (P = 0.0009 and P < or = 0.0001, respectively). Treatment to the higher Hb target associated with reduced event-free survival in the subgroup with eccentric LVH at baseline (P = 0.034). In conclusion, LVH is common and associates with poor outcomes among patients with stages 3 to 4 CKD, although both progression and regression of abnormal LV geometry occur.

","Abdu A. et al.","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The life expectancy of patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) has improved with modern medical care, and this has led to frequent observation of various chronic complications of the disease including abnormalities in renal function. Proteinuria is not only a marker of renal disease but is also a predictor of disease progression. This screening study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of proteinuria among adult SCA patients in Kano, Nigeria, which has not been reported previously. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 200 adult SCA patients were studied. They consisted of 100 men and 100 women. Blood was collected for the assay of serum urea, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Urine dipstick test for the presence of proteinuria and other abnormalities was done, and 24-hour urine protein was measured in those with significant proteinuria. RESULTS: Mean age of the male patients was 25.1 ± 1.0 years, whereas the mean age of the female patients was 22.8 ± 4.2 years. Twenty eight percent (32 males, 24 females) of the subjects were observed to have significant proteinuria. The mean estimated eGFR of the males was 88 ± 19.6 ml/min while that of the females was 92 ± 10.2 ml/min. The male SCA patients with proteinuria had a mean eGFR of 70 ± 6.9 ml/min, whereas the female SCA patients with proteinuria had mean eGFR of 101 ± 2.5 ml/min. Among the male patients with proteinuria, 50% had chronic kidney disease (CKD). CONCLUSION: Proteinuria which is a marker of renal insufficiency is common among adult SCA patients, and routine screening for proteinuria may help detect those at increased risk of renal disease.

","Fievet P. et al.","Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in predialysis stage. Iron deficiency is more common than in normal patients and plays a key role in the genesis of anemia. Its correction avoids the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) or reduces their dosage. Treatment with oral iron is often poorly tolerated and ineffective, necessitating the use of intravenous iron. New forms of injectable iron allow the use of high doses and correct iron deficiency in a single administration with consequent preservation of venous capital and lower costs. We studied the effectiveness of iron dextran of low molecular weight (LMWID) in high doses to correct iron deficiency and treat anemia in predialysis CKD patients. Twenty-nine doses of 500 to 1600 mg were administered to 25 patients followed for CKD (GFR between 60 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), selected on biological criteria of iron deficiency defined by a ratio of transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20% and/or serum ferritin of less than 100 μg/L. Patients received treatment by ESA in 16 cases out of 29. One month after treatment, hemoglobin (Hb) increased significantly (11.4±1.6 vs 10.4±1.4 g/dL, P=0.0003) along with a significant increase in TSAT (21.3±7.3 vs 13.3±3.8%, P=0.000003) and serum ferritin (286±253 vs 91±60 μg/L, P=0.00005). Six patients had a serum ferritin greater than 500 μg/L after treatment, which may put them at risk of iron overload. Their serum ferritin was higher than the rest of the population before treatment, while the TSAT was no different, reflecting a functional deficiency. Their hemoglobin did not increase after treatment in contrast to the rest of the population suggesting the unavailability of iron for erythropoiesis with accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system. Renal function did not change significantly and there were no cases of acute renal failure. No immediate side effect was observed. Three patients presented delayed reactions to such self-limiting myalgia and arthralgia. No venous inflammatory reaction was noted. The administration of high doses of LMWID is effective in treating anemia of CKD in the predialysis stage with a satisfactory tolerance, without affecting kidney function and helps preserve the venous capital. It should be reserved for patients whose serum ferritin is less than or equal to 150 μg/L.","2012","Nephrologie & therapeutique"," We studied the effectiveness of iron dextran of low molecular weight ( LMWID ) in high doses to correct iron deficiency and treat anemia in predialysis CKD patients ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

However, the effects of HIF-PHIs on iron regulation have not been consistent among clinical trials. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of six HIF-PHIs on iron regulation in non-dialysis CKD patients. Electronic databases were searched from inception to April 20, 2020, for eligible studies. Changes from baseline in transferrin saturation (TSAT), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), iron, ferritin, and hepcidin levels were pooled using the inverse-variance method and presented as the mean difference (MD) or standardized MD (SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis of the included studies showed that, in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, HIF-PHIs decreased TSAT (MD, -4.51; 95 % CI, -5.81 to -3.21), ferritin (MD, -47.29; 95 % CI, -54.59 to -40.00) and hepcidin (SMD, -0.94; 95 % CI, -1.25 to -0.62), increased TIBC (MD, 9.15; 95 % CI, 7.08-11.22), and did not affect serum iron (MD, -0.31; 95 % CI, -2.05 to 1.42) despite enhanced erythropoiesis. This systematic review suggests that HIF-PHIs promote iron utilization in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients. Importantly, HIF-PHIs are associated with increased transferrin levels (and TIBC), leading to reduced TSAT. Therefore, the reduction of TSAT after HIF-PHIs should not be interpreted as iron deficiency.","2021","Pharmacological research",,"Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Agarwal R.","Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are approved for avoiding transfusions, a risk that increases when hemoglobin (Hgb) falls to <10 g/dl. Transfusions increase sensitization, prolong the waiting time to and the likelihood of transplantation, and when transplantation is performed worsen graft survival. Accordingly, the risk of transfusion among those expecting transplantation is comparable to that of cardiovascular events. Nonetheless, targeting Hgb to >13 g/dl is associated with increased cardiovascular events. Paradoxically, if this level is achieved mortality is lower. The anemia paradox--higher cardiovascular events when targeting higher Hgb but lower events when patients achieve these targets--appears to be at least partially attributable to a hyporesponse to ESAs. Whether it is the ESAs or conditions that lead to the increased ESA dose that provokes morbidity cannot be answered definitively at present. The lowest ESA dose to achieve the desired level of anemia correction appears to be a safer strategy. In acute illnesses, reducing the dose of ESAs or stopping it altogether may aggravate anemia, but this may be permissible. The rate of rise in Hgb>1 g/dl in any 2-week period is associated with an increase in blood pressure (BP) and poor outcomes. Accordingly, while initiating and maintaining ESA therapy, monitoring BP at home twice daily is warranted. The clinical decision-making process in managing anemia should consider the risks of transfusion; kidney transplant potential; presence of cancer; and the risks of stroke, heart failure, and possibly death.

","Pisani A. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD). Controversies exist about the optimal route of administration for iron therapy. Liposomal iron, a new generation oral iron with high gastrointestinal absorption and bioavailability and a low incidence of side effects, seems to be a promising new strategy of iron replacement. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine whether liposomal iron, compared with intravenous (IV) iron, improves anaemia in ND-CKD patients. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label trial, 99 patients with CKD (stage 3-5, not on dialysis) and iron deficiency anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) ≤12 g/dL, ferritin ≤100 ng/mL, transferrin saturation ≤25%] were assigned (2:1) to receive oral liposomal iron (30 mg/day, Group OS) or a total dose of 1000 mg of IV iron gluconate (125 mg infused weekly) (Group IV) for 3 months. The patients were followed-up for the treatment period and 1 month after drug withdrawal. The primary end point was to evaluate the effects of the two treatments on Hb levels; the iron status, compliance and adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: The short-term therapy with IV iron produced a more rapid Hb increase compared with liposomal iron, although the final increase in Hb was similar with either treatment; the difference between the groups was statistically significant at the first month and such difference disappeared at the end of treatment. After iron withdrawal, Hb concentrations remained stable in Group IV, while recovered to baseline in the OS group. The replenishment of iron stores was greater in the IV group. The incidence of adverse event was significantly lower in the oral group (P < 0.001), and the adherence was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that oral liposomal iron is a safe and efficacious alternative to IV iron gluconate to correct anaemia in ND-CKD patients, although its effects on repletion of iron stores and on stability of Hb after drug discontinuation are lower.","2015","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

According to bone marrow iron distribution (iliac crest biopsy, Perls' stain), 26 had iron deficiency anemia, 21 anemia of chronic disorders and 7 had normal iron stores. Medullar hepcidin and ferroportin expression (immunofluorescence (IF), semiquantitative scales) and serum hepcidin (Hep25 - ELISA) were the main studied parameters. RESULTS: Low hepcidin and high ferroportin expression by erythroblast and macrophage were seen in iron deficiency anemia, while the opposites were true in anemia of chronic disorders. In regression analysis, higher Hep25 and ferritin predicted hepcidin expression (R(2)=0.48; P < 0.0001), while lower ferritin and Hep25 - predicted ferroportin expression (R(2) = 0.29; P = 0.003) by erythroblast; inflammation had no contribution. In ROC analysis, serum hepcidin and ferritin had similar moderate utility in differentiating iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disorders (AUC 0.63 95% CI 0.47-0.79 and 0.76 95% CI 0.61-0.90, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in anemic epoetin naive non-dialysis CKD patients, hepcidin and ferroportin expression by erythroblast and macrophage are closely related to bone marrow iron distribution. Although the hepcidin-ferroportin system seems regulated by ferritin-driven Hep25, serum hepcidin and peripheral iron indices are of little help in describing bone marrow iron status.","2015","Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"," OBJECTIVES : The hepcidin-ferroportin system is involved in both conditions associated with iron-restricted erythropoiesis in renal anemia : iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disorders ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Individuals with the triad of diabetes, CKD, and anemia represent a significant proportion of patients with cardiovascular disease and are at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Cox proportional hazards models, we identified independent predictors of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for myocardial ischemia, or heart failure (HF) in 3,847 patients in the TREAT, 961 (25%) of whom experienced this outcome. The predictors (ranked by χ(2) value) were prior HF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.74, 95% CI 1.51-2.01), age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04 per year), log urine protein/creatinine ratio (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.13-1.26 per log unit ), C-reactive protein ≥6.6 mg/L (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.23-1.69, compared with C-reactive protein ≤3.0 mg/L), and abnormal electrocardiogram (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.21-1.66 ), all P < .0001. Addition of cardiac-derived biomarkers (subset of first 1,000 patients enrolled) significantly enhanced risk estimation, with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide becoming the highest ranked predictor of outcome (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.15-1.46 per log unit, P < .001) and troponin T providing additional predictive information. These biomarkers improved risk classification in 17.8% (9.4%-26.2%) of patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with diabetes, CKD, and anemia, cardiovascular risk is most strongly predicted by age, history of HF, C-reactive protein, urinary protein/creatinine ratio, abnormal electrocardiogram, and 2 specific cardiac biomarkers, serum N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin T, which are elevated in many.

","Więcek A. et al.","INTRODUCTION: epoetin zeta is a recently introduced recombinant erythropoietin, designed to be biologically similar to epoetin alfa. This posthoc analysis evaluated the impact of switching patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis from epoetin alfa to epoetin zeta, or vice versa, on hemoglobin concentration, epoetin dose, and patient safety. METHODS: data were analyzed from three published trials: two 24-week randomized, double-blind (maintenance and induction) studies and a 56-week, open-label, follow-on study involving adult patients with CKD stage 5, maintained on hemodialysis, and receiving epoetin alfa or epoetin zeta. Patients had either completed and switched treatments within the maintenance study, or had completed the induction or maintenance study on epoetin alfa and then switched to, and completed at least 12 weeks of follow-up treatment on, epoetin zeta. Mean hemoglobin levels and epoetin dose were evaluated pre- (0-4 weeks before) and post- (8-12 weeks after) switch, and were considered equivalent for the two treatments if the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the intraindividual differences in mean values fell within accepted limits. RESULTS: overall, 481 patients were included in the analysis. Mean hemoglobin concentration was maintained at target levels (10.5-12.5 g/dL) throughout the drug switch. The mean differences in hemoglobin concentration and associated 95% CIs following the switch remained within prespecified equivalence limits (± 1.0 g/dL). The 95% CIs of the mean difference in weekly epoetin dose postswitch also remained within prespecified equivalence margins (± 45 IU/kg; upper limit 17.83 IU/kg, lower limit -10.91 IU/kg). Both treatments were similarly well tolerated. CONCLUSION: our data suggest that epoetin alfa and epoetin zeta therapy can be interchanged without any clinically significant alteration in efficacy, safety, or epoetin dose, in patients with CKD on dialysis receiving stable epoetin maintenance therapy.","2010","Advances in therapy",,"Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: We performed observational study on 27 CKD patients in stage 4 or 5 with renal anemia requiring use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). All patients received CERA (Mircera; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) subcutaneously in dose of 0.6 microg per kg every two weeks during the correction phase of anemia treatment or once monthly during the maintenance treatment. Dose of CERA was modified according to manufacturer instructions. Iron supplementation was administrated orally or intravenously in order to achieve serum ferritin 200-500 microg/L. Patients were followed up to 1 year (from 3-12 months). Response criteria for CERA were Hb increase >10 g/L above baseline or Hb > or = 110 g/L. RESULTS: Hb statistically significant (p < 0.05), increased during the observation period. The median at baseline was 94 g/L and after 6 months and one year were 108 g/L and 114.5 g/L respectively. Furthermore, the range of the lowest and highest values of Hb gradually decreased indicating less Hb fluctuation. After one year, all patients had Hb range 100 g/L to 120 g/L. There were no statistically significant differences between Hb between groups of patients stratified according to the primary kidney disease and age. During the study period two patients died due to myocardial infarction, probably not associated with CERA administration according to observed Hb levels (103 and 110 g/L). Only registered side effect was slight increase in arterial pressure, controlled with antihypertensive drugs. The majority of patients had reported better exercise tolerance and sleep and less irritability.

,"36617559"," How to diagnose iron deficiency in chronic disease: A review of current methods and potential marker for the outcome. ","Rohr M. et al.","Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide. It is often observed in patients with chronic diseases, such as heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. ID is associated with poor clinical outcome, including poor performance, reduced quality of life, as well as increased hospitalization and mortality. The aim of this review is to provide an overview about the role of ID in chronic diseases (HF, CKD, IBD, cancer) regarding their current definitions and clinical relevance; diagnostic accuracy of iron parameters in chronic inflammatory conditions and its potential as prognostic markers. Due to different definitions and guideline recommendations of ID, various laboratory parameters for ID diagnostic exist and there is no general consensus about the definition of ID and its treatment. Still, a general trend can be observed across all investigated indications of this review (HF, CKD, IBD, cancer) that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are the two parameters mentioned most often and emphasized in all guidelines to define ID and guide treatment. The most commonly used threshold values for the diagnosis of ID are TSAT of < 20% and serum ferritin of < 100-300 µg/L. Noteworthy, both TSAT and particularly ferritin are frequently applied, but both may vary due to inflammatory conditions. Studies showed that TSAT is less affected by inflammatory processes and may therefore be more accurate and reliable than serum ferritin, particularly in conditions with elevated inflammatory state. A low iron status and particularly a low TSAT value was associated with a poor outcome in all investigated indications, with the strongest evidence in HF patients. Routine surveillance of iron status in these groups of patients with chronic conditions is advisable to detect ID early. Depending on the inflammatory state, TSAT < 20% may be the more accurate diagnostic marker of ID than ferritin. Moreover, TSAT may also be the more reliable estimate for the prognosis, particularly in HF.","2023","European journal of medical research"," The aim of this review is to provide an overview about the role of ID in chronic diseases ( HF , CKD , IBD , cancer ) regarding their current definitions and clinical relevance ; diagnostic accuracy of iron parameters in chronic inflammatory conditions and its potential as prognostic markers ","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not undergoing dialysis, the efficacy and safety of daprodustat, as compared with the conventional erythropoiesis-stimulating agent darbepoetin alfa, are unknown. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial with blinded adjudication of cardiovascular outcomes, we compared daprodustat with darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis. The primary outcomes were the mean change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 and the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke). RESULTS: Overall, 3872 patients were randomly assigned to receive daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa. The mean (±SD) baseline hemoglobin levels were similar in the two groups. The mean (±SE) change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 was 0.74±0.02 g per deciliter in the daprodustat group and 0.66±0.02 g per deciliter in the darbepoetin alfa group (difference, 0.08 g per deciliter; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.13), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.75 g per deciliter. During a median follow-up of 1.9 years, a first MACE occurred in 378 of 1937 patients (19.5%) in the daprodustat group and in 371 of 1935 patients (19.2%) in the darbepoetin alfa group (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.19), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25. The percentages of patients with adverse events were similar in the two groups.

","Maurin N.","The German Quality Assurance Directive for Dialysis (QSD-RL) stipulates that no more than 15 % of all patients treated in a dialysis unit in any quarter may have a hemoglobin (Hb) value lower than 10 g/dl. For approximately 90 % of dialysis patients, this Hb threshold value can be simply achieved by administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). However, the question is raised as to wether this Hb threshold accords with the current state of knowledge. It is now evident from four randomized controlled trials (above all the TREAT study) and three meta-analyses that an ESA-induced increase in Hb does not produce any significant survival benefit in cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but may actually be detrimental. Critical attention must be focused in this regard on the higher risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, as well as malignoma-associated risks. In 2011, in response to these findings, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Drug Directive (AM-RL) of the German Federal Joint Committee and KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) amended guidelines for the treatment of renal anemia. Very restrictive recommendations were made regarding the use of ESA in CKD, according to which the Hb threshold value of 10 g/dl stipulated in the Quality Assurance Directive is now obsolete, thus necessitating prompt revision of the Directive. Two alternatives are available in this regard: either the 10 g/dl Hb threshold value applicable hitherto is withdrawn without replacement, and individualized treatment of renal anemia is practised (""individualization"") instead, or a threshold value of 9 g/dl (modified ""standardization"") is applied in future.","2012","Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: This was a phase III, active-controlled, multicenter, partially randomized, open-label study in Japanese patients with NDD CKD. Patients who had used recombinant human erythropoietin or darbepoetin alfa (DA) before conversion were randomized to roxadustat or DA (comparative arms). Patients who had used epoetin beta pegol before conversion were allocated to roxadustat (reference arm). The primary endpoint was change in average hemoglobin (Hb) level from baseline during the evaluation period (Weeks 18-24). Longer term efficacy and safety were evaluated in roxadustat-treated patients over 52 weeks. RESULTS: In this study, 334 patients were randomized/allocated to receive treatment (n = 132, roxadustat [comparative]; n = 131, DA [comparative]; n = 71, roxadustat [reference]). The estimated difference between the roxadustat (comparative) and DA (comparative) groups in the least squares mean of change of average Hb levels of Weeks 18 to 24 from baseline was -0.07 g/dl, with the lower limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.23 g/dl, thereby confirming the noninferiority of roxadustat to DA. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥3% of patients in any treatment group) observed during the 24-week treatment period included nasopharyngitis, CKD, hyperkalemia, and hypertension. CONCLUSION: Roxadustat maintained Hb within 10 to 12 g/dl in NDD CKD patients and was noninferior to DA.

Endpoints included mean of average doses of roxadustat and DA per administration in the last 6 weeks (AAD/6W) by prior ESA-resistance index (ERI), iron repletion (transferrin saturation; ferritin), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Of 415 enrolled patients, 303 were randomized (roxadustat, n = 151; DA, n = 152). Weight-adjusted AAD/6W increased with increasing ERI for roxadustat (ERI <3.3, 0.89 mg/kg; ERI ≥8.4, 1.51 mg/kg) and DA (ERI <3.3, 0.26 μg/kg; ERI ≥8.4, 0.91 μg/kg); the weight-adjusted AAD/6W relative to within-arm mean AAD/6W showed a trend toward increased DA doses for the ERI ≥8.4 category (P = .089). AAD/6W remained stable for roxadustat but increased for DA with decreasing baseline iron repletion markers. The relationship between roxadustat doses and end of treatment (EoT) hs-CRP was not significant (estimated slope, -0.494; P = .814); a trend toward increased DA doses was observed with increasing EoT hs-CRP (estimated slope, 2.973; P = .075).

Here, we report that similar to patients with CKD, mice with adenine-induced CKD develop inflammation, anemia, and skeletal muscle wasting. These complications are also observed in mice fed high phosphate diet even without CKD. Ablation of pathologic FGF23-FGFR4 signaling did not protect mice on an increased phosphate diet or mice with adenine-induced CKD from these sequelae. However, low phosphate diet ameliorated anemia and skeletal muscle wasting in a genetic mouse model of CKD. Our mechanistic in vitro studies indicate that phosphate elevations induce inflammatory signaling and increase hepcidin expression in hepatocytes, a potential causative link between hyperphosphatemia, anemia, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Our study suggests that high phosphate intake, as caused by the consumption of processed food, may have harmful effects irrespective of pre-existing kidney injury, supporting not only the clinical utility of treating hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients but also arguing for limiting phosphate intake in healthy individuals.","2022","eLife",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

An 89 year-old man with anemia and on maintenance hemodialysis was successfully treated with a dose-up of darbepoetin alfa from 10 to 20 μg per week, and the dose was gradually tapered to 5 μg. Later, serum hemoglobin levels decreased with the newly occurring sustained inflammation and left pleural effusion of an unknown cause, and the darbepoetin alfa dose was increased again to 20 μg per week, which was not effective. Darbepoetin alfa was switched to 4 mg of daprodustat daily, which was fairly effective under sustained inflammation, with serum hemoglobin levels maintained at 11-12 g/dL. The increase in hemoglobin levels was ascribed to the increase in the number of red blood cells, not the mean corpuscular hemoglobin level. During the inflammatory state, despite the contrasting effect on anemia by the 20 μg of darbepoetin alfa weekly and 4 mg of daprodustat daily, the reticulocyte counts were equivalent. The serum erythropoietin levels during daprodustat administration were within the physiological range (8.5-18.8 mIU/mL). For anemia treatment in hemodialysis patients, daprodustat is less influenced by the inflammatory status than darbepoetin alfa, and one of the possible reasons for this includes the extended red blood cell lifespan.","2022","CEN case reports",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

To date, no satisfactory mechanism has explained these Zn metabolism abnormalities. We collected blood samples from patients on hemodialysis, 5/6 nephrectomized rats and phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced anemic mice and rats and compared them with their normal counterparts. We found that all the anemic animals had significantly decreased plasma Zn levels but elevated erythrocyte Zn levels. We also found that in anemic mice, new red blood cells (reticulocytes) had a ~7-fold higher Zn concentration than mature erythrocytes. When excess Zn was supplied to the rats, there was a ~1.2-fold increase in the Zn level in the rat bones. When Zn was depleted in the rats, the bones lost the greatest amount of Zn in the body (a 45% decrease). We prepared Zn-depleted rats and rendered these rats anemic by treating them with PHZ, and we compared them with normal rats. We found that in PHZ-induced anemia, rats released ~16% of Zn from their bones. Rat bones not only act as a 'reservoir' to adjust the excess or deficient Zn levels but also release Zn in anemia, and the released Zn stimulates erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. In anemia, Zn is redistributed from the plasma (causing the plasma Zn level to decreases) and bones to the bone marrow to produce reticulocytes (causing erythrocyte Zn level elevation).","2020","Journal of inorganic biochemistry",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Pergola P. et al.","BACKGROUND: Roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, increases hemoglobin by stimulating erythropoietin synthesis and improving iron availability through facilitation of iron uptake and/or release from stores. In this exploratory analysis, we assessed the effect of roxadustat treatment on laboratory parameters related to iron metabolism in patients with anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Data were pooled from pivotal, randomized, phase 3 roxadustat trials: three placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in nondialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD and three open-label, active-comparator (epoetin alfa) trials in dialysis-dependent (DD) CKD. In this exploratory analysis, mean changes from baseline in hemoglobin, iron parameters, and hepcidin, and intravenous (iv) iron use were evaluated. Pooled results in NDD CKD and DD CKD patients are reported. RESULTS: Overall, 4277 patients with NDD CKD and 3890 patients with DD CKD were evaluated. Hemoglobin increases with roxadustat treatment were accompanied by increases in serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin from baseline through week 52. With epoetin alfa, the hemoglobin increase was accompanied by decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin, but serum iron decreased, and there was no change in TIBC. With placebo, there were no changes in hemoglobin, iron parameters, or hepcidin. During treatment, iv iron use was reduced with roxadustat versus placebo and epoetin alfa. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NDD CKD and DD CKD, roxadustat treatment is associated with increases in serum iron and TIBC, accompanied by reduced hepcidin and indicative of improved iron kinetics. Patients treated with roxadustat achieved target hemoglobin levels with less iv iron use versus comparators. Practitioners treating patients with anemia of CKD with roxadustat should consider its unique effects when interpreting iron parameters.","2022","Kidney360",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Plastina J. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Anemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be divided into anemic patients without or with functional iron deficiency (FID). The increase in the number of cases of hemosiderosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD) attributed to excessive intravenous iron replacement has called for the investigation of the factors involved in the genesis of FID. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of FID in patients with CKD on HD, characterize the included individuals in terms of clinical and workup parameters, and assess their nutritional, oxidative stress, and inflammation statuses. This cross-sectional study assembled a convenience sample of 183 patients with CKD on HD treated in Southern Brazil. Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into two groups, one with anemic subjects with FID and one with anemic patients without FID. Participants answered a questionnaire probing into socio-epidemiological factors, underwent anthropometric measurements, and were tested for markers of anemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nutrition. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The date sets were treated on software package GraphPad InStat version 3.1. Variables were tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, chi-square, Student's t, and Mann-Whitney tests. Statistical significance was attributed to differences with a p < 0.05. RESULTS: Markers of inflammation were not statistically different between the two groups. Markers of anemia and nutrition were significantly lower in patients with FID. Patients with FID were prescribed higher doses of parenteral iron (p < 0,05). DISCUSSION: FID was associated with lower nutritional marker levels, but not to increased levels of markers of inflammation or oxidative stress, as reported in the literature.

METHODS: Electronic databases were searched systematically from inception to July 2021 to look for randomized control trials (RCTs) that evaluated ROX NDD-CKD patients. Hemoglobin level and iron utilization parameters, including ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin, and hepcidin were analyzed for efficacy. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated and presented with their 95% confidential intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Nine RCTs included a total of 3,175 patients in the ROX group and 2,446 patients in the control group. When compared the control group, ROX increased Hb level significantly (SMD: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.22; P< 0.00001) and improved iron utilization parameters by decreasing ferritin (SMD: -0.32; 95% CI: -0.51, -0.14; P = 0.0006), TSAT (SMD: -0.19; 95% CI: -0.32, -0.07; P = 0.003), and hepcidin (SMD: -0.74; 95% CI: -1.09, -0.39; P< 0.0001) and increasing TIBC (SMD: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.22; P< 0.00001) and transferrin (SMD: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.71; P< 0.00001).

Medical histories and laboratory test results were collected from 2,924 patients with primary GN hospitalized in Ruijin Hospital of Shanghai between January 2003 and August 2009. The leading cause of CKD was primary glomerular diseases, which were responsible for up to 53.5% of all cases. IgA nephropathy was the most common cause, accounting for 38.7%, followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The anemia rate of GN patients in early stages of CKD (stages 1-2 and 3) was 16-36%, and rapidly accelerated to 65.8 and 80.2% in advanced CKD stage 4 and stage 5, respectively.

METHODS: Our series consisted of 504 older adults enrolled in a multicenter observational study carried out in twelve Acute Geriatric and Internal Medicine wards throughout Italy. CKD was defined as an eGFR< 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Anemia, Short Portable Status Mental Questionnaire (SPMSQ), Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL), sarcopenia, and Charlson index were considered in the analysis. 3-year survival was investigated by Cox regression and prognostic interactions among study variables were assessed by survival tree analysis. Accuracy of different survival models was investigated by C-index. RESULTS: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), anemia, sarcopenia, SPMSQ ≥ 5, and impairment in 1 or more BADL were significantly associated with mortality. Survival tree analysis showed that patients with eGFR < 35.32 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and SPMSQ ≥ 5 had the highest risk of mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 5.49, 95%CI: 3.04-9.94] followed by those with eGFR < 35.32 ml/min/1.73 m(2), hemoglobin < 11.95 g/dL and SPMSQ < 5 (HR:3.65; 95%CI: 2.21-6.02) and those with eGFR 35.32-47.99 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and sarcopenia (HR:3.65; 95%CI: 1.99-6.69).

","Fuertinger D. et al.","Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is challenging, due to its severity, frequent hypo-responsiveness to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and common hemoglobin cycling. Nonlinear dose-response curves and long delays in the effect of treatment on red blood cell population size complicate predictions of hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in individual patients. A comprehensive physiology based mathematical model for erythropoiesis was adapted individually to 60 hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs by identifying physiologically meaningful key model parameters from temporal Hgb data. Crit-Line® III monitors provided non-invasive Hgb measurements for every hemodialysis treatment. We used Hgb data during a 150-day baseline period together to estimate a patient's individual red blood cell lifespan, effects of the ESA on proliferation of red cell progenitor cells, endogenous erythropoietin production and ESA half-life. Estimated patient specific parameters showed excellent alignment with previously conducted clinical studies in hemodialysis patients. Further, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reflected empirical hemoglobin dynamics in demographically, anthropometrically and clinically diverse patients and accurately predicted the Hgb response to ESA therapy in individual patients for up to 21 weeks. The findings suggest that estimated model parameters can be used as a proxy for parameters that are clinically very difficult to quantify. The presented method has the potential to provide new insights into the individual pathophysiology of renal anemia and its association with clinical outcomes and can potentially be used to guide personalized anemia treatment.","2018","PloS one",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","de F. and Piñera C.","As our knowledge of managing renal anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin has grown, new clinical challenges have emerged. Although initial observational studies produced important favorable results, troubling observations later came from 4 randomized controlled trials that assigned CKD patients to intervention with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) to achieve high hemoglobin levels (Hb). The difference between the observational studies and these randomized controlled trials comes from the observation of higher cardiovascular events when targeting higher Hb, but lower events once patients had achieved these Hb targets. In all of the 4 RCTs, the primary intervention was 'targeting' a higher Hb, and using higher dosages of ESA as the means. Therefore, the question to be solved is: what is harmful with recombinant human erythropoietin--targeting higher hemoglobin or achieving higher hemoglobin? Evidence supporting a relationship between ESA exposure and worse outcomes is not universal, and these comorbidities would require the administration of high doses. However, increasing ESA doses in hyporesponsive patients to achieve a specific target is not reasonable. Managing anemia in CKD patients is complex. It is affected by the underlying disease, comorbid conditions, the environment and several other factors that differ among patients. Thus, anemia management in these patients needs an individualized approach. Each patient should be treated according to a Hb target with the lowest effective ESA dose, while avoiding large fluctuations in Hb levels or prolonged periods outside the target. This strategy may necessitate changes to the ESA dose, dosing frequency and iron supplementation over the course of a patient's treatment, and proactive management of conditions that can affect ESA responsiveness. While all ESAs effectively increase Hb levels, differences with respect to route of administration, pharmacokinetics, and dosing frequency and efficiency should be considered to maximize the benefits of ESA treatment for the individual patient.","2011","Contributions to nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Xu Y. et al.","BACKGROUND: Attaining the narrow haemoglobin (Hb) range recommended by European Renal Best Practice Guidelines renal anaemia guidelines may be difficult, and whether this leads to better outcomes following dialysis initiation is not known. METHODS: This was an observational study from the Swedish Renal Registry 2012-16, including all patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) initiating renal anaemia treatment. We evaluated factors associated with off-target Hb attainment (<10 and >12 g/dL). For those who initiated dialysis, we explored associations between the pre-end-stage kidney disease (pre-ESKD) time in which Hb was within or above range, and pre-ESKD Erythropoietin Resistance Index (ERI) with the 1-year risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events + (MACE+). RESULTS: About 5000 patients initiated anaemia treatment, contributing to 25 431 consecutive visits over time. Patients with polycystic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy and nephrosclerosis, with recent bleeding/transfusion, with higher C-reactive protein or abnormal phosphate had higher odds of maintaining Hb below range. Conversely, patients with older age, CKD Stages 3b-4, pyelonephritis, kidney transplant, iron medication, higher ESA doses or abnormal serum calcium and albumin had higher odds of maintaining Hb above range. A total of 1361 patients initiated dialysis, among whom 220 deaths and 453 MACE+ occurred. A greater time spent with a pre-ESKD Hb >12 g/dL was associated with a lower risk of MACE+ (hazard ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval 0.61-0.94) after dialysis initiation, and a lower pre-ESKD Erythropoietin Resistance Index (ERI) was associated with improved survival (1.39; 1.02-1.90).

METHODS: To clarify the associations between renal impairment and anemia, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,105 60 to 89-year-old men, who were not taking medication for anemia and were undergoing general health check-ups. RESULTS: Compared with non-chronic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was found to constitute a significant risk of anemia. However, we noted that this risk was lower for mild renal impairment (60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≤ GFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2). Compared with the non-CKD reference group, the classical cardiovascular risk factors adjusted odds ratio (OR) for anemia was 1.81 (1.23 to 2.68) and compared with the normal renal function (GFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) reference group, the ORs for mild renal impairment and CKD were 0.26 (0.15 to 0.47) and 0.60 (0.33 to 1.09).

","Pergola P. et al.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In clinical practice, physicians often use once-weekly (QW) and biweekly (Q2W) dosing of epoetin alfa to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the literature supports this practice, previous studies were limited by short treatment duration, lack of randomization, or absence of the approved three times per week (TIW) dosing arm. This randomized trial evaluated extended dosing regimens of epoetin alfa, comparing QW and Q2W to TIW dosing in anemic CKD subjects. The primary objective was to show that treatment with epoetin alfa at QW and Q2W intervals was not inferior to TIW dosing. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: 375 subjects with stage 3 to 4 CKD were randomized equally to the three groups and treated for 44 wk; to explore the impact of changing from TIW to QW administration on hemoglobin (Hb) control and adverse events, subjects on TIW switched to QW after 22 wk. The Hb was measured weekly, and the dose of epoetin alfa was adjusted to achieve and maintain an Hb level of 11.0 to 11.9 g/dl. RESULTS: Both the QW and Q2W regimens met the primary efficacy endpoint. More subjects in the TIW group than in the QW and Q2W groups exceeded the Hb ceiling.

","McCullough P. and Lepor N.","Recently there has been considerable interest in the associations between blood hemoglobin (Hb) level, renal function, and cardiovascular disease. Anemia is a common feature of end-stage renal disease, but it also accompanies lesser degrees of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The degree of anemia roughly approximates the severity of CKD. Anemia seen in diabetes has been linked to diabetic nephropathy; however, diabetes itself affects the hematologic system in several ways. Anemia is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiovascular morbidity, progressive loss of kidney function, and poor quality of life. Anemia seems to act as a mortality multiplier; that is, at every decrease in Hb below 12 g/dL, mortality increases in patients with CKD, cardiovascular disease, and those with both. Unlike blood transfusion, treatment of anemia with exogenous erythropoietin in patients with cardiorenal disease has shown promise in reducing morbidity and in improving survival and quality of life. Increasing the Hb level from less than 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL has resulted in favorable changes in left ventricular remodeling, improved ejection fraction, improved functional classification, and higher levels of peak oxygen consumption with exercise testing. Clinical trials are underway to test the role of erythropoietin in patients with CKD and in patients with heart failure.","2005","Reviews in cardiovascular medicine",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

""Rapid decrease"" was defined as a decrease in the GFR of >or=6 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year. Anemia was defined as baseline hematocrit <36%. Multivariate logistic regression weighted by the number of GFR assessments was used to test the relation between anemia and rapid decrease. We also evaluated whether CKD (baseline GFR </=60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) modified the relation between anemia and rapid decrease. In the 6,360 subjects, the mean age was 59 years, 31% had CKD, and 6% had anemia. Median follow-up was 2 years. In multivariate analysis, anemia was associated with a 1.30 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.45) of rapid decrease in GFR. In subjects with CKD, anemia was associated with a 1.71 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.05) of rapid decrease, while in subjects without CKD, anemia was associated with a 1.16 increased odds (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.31) of rapid decrease (p for interaction <0.001).

Sucrosomial® iron, a new generation oral iron with high absorption and bioavailability and a low incidence of side effects, has shown to be not inferior to intravenous (IV) iron in the replacement of iron deficiency anemia in patients with ND-CKD. Besides the clinical benefit, it is also important to determine the comparative total costs of oral versus IV iron administrations. The aim of this study was to perform a cost-minimization analysis of oral Sucrosomial iron, compared with IV iron gluconate from an Italian societal perspective. METHODS: Cost analysis was performed on the 99 patients with ND-CKD and iron-deficiency anemia of the randomized trial by Pisani et al. Human and material resources utilization was recorded during each iron administration. According to study perspective, direct and indirect costs were considered. Costs for each resource unit were taken from official Italian sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed an average cost/cycle per patient of € 111 for oral iron and € 1302 for IV iron. Thus, the potential saving was equal to € 1191 per patient/cycle. The sensitivity analysis showed that the most sensitive driver is the time loss by patient and caregivers for the therapy and related-care, followed by the minutes of nursing care and the number of kilometres travelled to reach the referral centre.

,"34280923"," Managing Anemia across the Stages of Kidney Disease in Those Hyporesponsive to Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents. ","Weir M.","BACKGROUND: Patients with CKD frequently have anemia that results from iron-restricted erythropoiesis and inflammation. Anemia of CKD is currently managed with iron supplements and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to promote erythropoiesis and with RBC transfusion in severe cases. Hyporesponse to ESAs, or the need for larger than usual doses to attain a given hemoglobin (Hb) level, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and presents a pressing clinical challenge, particularly for patients on dialysis. This paper reviews ESA hyporesponse and potential new therapeutic options in the management of anemia of CKD. SUMMARY: The most common causes of ESA hyporesponse include iron deficiency and inflammation, and to a lesser degree, secondary hyperparathyroidism, inadequate dialysis, malnutrition, and concomitant medications. Management of ESA hyporesponse is multipronged and involves treating low level infections, ensuring adequate nutrition, and optimizing iron status and dialysis modality, although some patients can remain refractory. Inflammation directly increases production and secretion of hepcidin, contributes to an impaired response to hypoxia, and suppresses proliferation of erythroid progenitors. Coordination of renal and hepatic erythropoietin (EPO) production and iron metabolism is under the control of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which are in turn regulated by HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PHs). HIF-PHs and hepcidin are therefore attractive potential drug targets particularly in patients with ESA hyporesponse. Several oral HIF-PH inhibitors have been evaluated in patients with anemia of CKD and have been shown to increase Hb and reduce hepcidin regardless of inflammation, iron status, or dialysis modality. These sustained effects are achieved through more modest increases in endogenous EPO compared with ESAs. Key Messages: Treatments that address ESA hyporesponse remain a significant unmet clinical need in patients with anemia of CKD. New therapies such as HIF-PH inhibitors have the potential to address fundamental aspects of ESA hyporesponse and provide a new therapeutic option in these patients.","2021","American journal of nephrology",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Locatelli F. and Del V.","INTRODUCTION: Anemia, a frequent and early complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), not only impairs quality of life but is also an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), together with iron, are the main therapeutic tool to correct anemia in CKD patients nowadays. AREAS COVERED: Following a literature search on PubMed using 'anemia', 'hemoglobin', 'erythropoietin' and 'target' as keywords, we critically analyzed ESAs, looking in depth at their distinct characteristics and possible advantages in the clinical setting. The introduction of biosimilars into the European market is also discussed. Finally, we reviewed current evidence about the optimal hemoglobin (Hb) target to aim at in CKD patients receiving ESA and possible treatment indications by international guidelines or health institutions. EXPERT OPINION: All ESAs are effective agents to correct anemia. Newer molecules have been developed with an improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. This translates into longer administration intervals than can be a true advantage, mainly for CKD patients not receiving dialysis. Short-acting epoetins, including biosimilars, should be administered more often, but can be cheaper than last-generation molecules. Following publication of the TREAT study, there is considerable confusion about the optimal Hb target to aim for in CKD patients using ESA. While waiting for Kidney Disease Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines recommendations, we believe that the general approach to anemia management in CKD patients should still aim at Hb levels of 11 - 12 g/dl; however, it is wise to use caution in those patients who are hyporesponsive to ESA or have a previous history of stroke or malignancies.","2012","Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy"," Finally , we reviewed current evidence about the optimal hemoglobin ( Hb ) target to aim at in CKD patients receiving ESA and possible treatment indications by international guidelines or health institutions ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Since kidney injury persisted even without exacerbation of anemia over 10 months, we performed an MV replacement. The anemia improved rapidly after the surgery; however, the renal function remained chronic kidney disease (CKD) after reoperation. Kidney injury was thought to be due to iron deposition and decreased renal perfusion that caused tubular injury. A comprehensive literature review shows that hemolysis due to MRCR in the early postoperative phase (within 3 postoperative months) can be often ameliorated with endothelialization without the need for reoperation; however, hemolysis in the late postoperative phase can persist even for a long period without reoperation. Chronic hemolysis can lead to kidney injury and progress to CKD even without clinical evidence of exacerbation of anemia. Therefore, in cases of late postoperative phase hemolysis, reoperation should be considered for better management of kidney injury and hemolytic anemia.","2015","CEN case reports",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Over two consecutive weeks, 418 recipients (males: 248; age: 50.8+/-12.7 years) were included, all were transplanted for more than six months. Mean serum creatinine (Scr) was 152+/-67 micromol/l and mean hemoglobin (Hb) was 12.4+/-1.8 g/dl (males: 12.8+/-1.9 g/dl; females 11.9+/-1.6 g/dl).

Correction of anemia in CKD patients includes the administration of both recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron. An optimization of iron treatment requires obtaining a target hemoglobin level and avoiding an excessive body-iron overload. The reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) has been shown to be an early indicator of iron-restricted erythropoiesis. The recent European guidelines for anemia treatment in CKD assessed the value for CHr >29 pg/cell as the reticulocyte parameter to evaluate a patient's iron needs. The reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (RET-He), recently introduced to determine the forward scatter of fluorescence-labeled reticulocytes, seems to be a sensitive indicator of iron-deficiency anemia. This study evaluates the concordance between the CHr parameter, used as a reference, and the new RET-He in a cohort of 57 dialysis patients referred to the Nephrology Unit of our hospital. All patients received erythropoietin, and iron was administered intravenously to maintain the hemoglobin level between 10 and 12 mg/dL. A total of 285 determinations were performed with both instruments. In the dialysis population, the 95% central range for CHr of 24.8 to 36.3 pg corresponds to a range for RET-He of 23.3 to 40.1 pg, with a mean bias of 1.12 pg between the 2 parameters. In comparison with CHr, the value of 30.5 pg for RET-He appeared to be the best cut-off point with a very good sensitivity and specificity to determine patients needing iron supplementation. Our study showed an excellent diagnostic efficiency of RET-He to evaluate patients needing iron support and demonstrated a strict correspondence between the classic CHr and the new Ret-He. This correspondence was independent of clinical changes, frequently occurring in dialysis patients.

RESULTS: HbA₁(C) was positively correlated with age (Rho = 0.13; p = 0.031), C-reactive protein (Rho = 0.14; p = 0.024), total cholesterol (Rho = 0.19; p = 0.001), triglycerides (Rho = 0.21; p < 0.001) and glucose (Rho = 0.21; p = 0.001), but it was negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol (Rho = -0.22; p < 0.001) and ESA dose (Rho = -0.27; p < 0.001). Across increasing HbA₁(C) tertiles, increased glucose levels and reduced use of ESA and dose of ESA were observed (p < 0.001), but there were no differences in insulin and HOMA index. In a stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, ESA dose was negatively associated with logHbA₁(C). HbA₁(C) did not predict mortality. CONCLUSION: In nondiabetic CKD stage 5 patients, HbA₁(C) levels were associated with ESA dose. HbA₁(C) was not independently associated with surrogate markers of insulin resistance or mortality.","2011","American journal of nephrology"," We studied 270 nondiabetic CKD stage 5 patients referred to initiate dialysis therapy [ median age : 54 years ( 43-63 ) , 154 males ] ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may play a role in treating these patients with anemia of unknown etiology (AUE). This study examines hemoglobin and cardiovascular outcomes among elderly anemic patients treated with ESAs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included all anemic patients older than age 60 years who had erythropoietin (EPO) measured between 2005 and 2013 at a single center. Three independent reviewers used defined criteria to assign each patient's anemia to 1 of 4 groups: chronic kidney disease (CKD), myelodysplastic syndrome, AUE, or other etiology. Logistic regression was used to compare treatment response (defined per the International Working Group response criteria in myelodysplasia). Adjusted Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the cardiovascular event hazard ratios associated with ESA treatment. A total of 570 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 101 received ESAs. There was a nonstatistically significant but quantitatively better response in AUE (47%) and CKD (54%) compared with other etiologies (22%). The adjusted odds ratio for response in AUE compared with other etiologies was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.838-13.0). A baseline EPO level <200 IU/L independently predicted treatment response. There was no statistically significant difference in cardiovascular events or cardiovascular event-free survival between the treated and untreated groups after adjusting for confounders. Our results suggest that ESAs may effectively treat AUE, and responses may be similar to those in CKD.

The main objective of this study was to assess the maintenance of Hb concentration with once-monthly intravenous and/or subcutaneous C.E.R.A. therapy in Latin American dialysis patients with chronic renal anemia previously treated with epoetin alfa s.c or i.v 1-3 times per week. METHODS: This was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, 32-week study of anemic patients with CKD previously treated with epoetin alfa sc or iv 1-3 times per week. After a 4-week screening period, during which mean Hb levels were maintained between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL on their previous erythropoiesis stimulating agent, eligible patients entered a 16-week C.E.R.A. dose titration period followed by a 4-week efficacy evaluation period (EEP) and a 28-week safety follow-up. The starting dose of C.E.R.A. was based on the previous dose of epoetin alfa. Doses of C.E.R.A. were then adjusted to maintain Hb levels within ±1.0 g/dL of the reference concentration and between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL. The Hb reference concentration was defined as the mean of all Hb levels during screening. The primary end point was the proportion of patients maintaining a mean Hb concentration (g/dL) within ±1 g/dL of their reference Hb and between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL during the EEP. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients from 27 centers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela entered the treatment period and 102 completed the prescribed course of C.E.R.A. Forty-five patients (43.7 %) maintained a mean Hb concentration within ±1 g/dL of their reference Hb value and between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL during the EEP. The median monthly dose remained constant at 120 μg during the titration period and during the EEP. On the average, there were only 2.3 dose changes per patient in 28 weeks of treatment, covering 7 C.E.R.A. scheduled administrations. 53 % of all dose changes were dose decreases, 47 % increases.

","Srinivasan R. et al.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Currently there is an inadequate data regarding effective management of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are on dialysis. In CKD patients' anemia mainly develops from decreased renal synthesis of erythropoietin (EPO) and iron deficiency. Our current study focused to effective management of anemia in CKD patients'. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational case series study. METHODS: Eligible patients were assigned to three study groups according to initial hemoglobin level i.e. Group I having Hb level below 11g/dL, Group II with Hb level of 11-13g/dL, and Group III with Hb level more than 13g/dL. Intravenous dosing of ESA's calculated according to the range of 150-300IU or equivalent microgram quantity per kilogram body weight was administered to patients in divided doses per week; alone or in combination with iron supplements. RESULTS: Study population (n=163; 100%), of which 124 subjects (76%) patients were treated with erythropoietin and iron supplements; rest of 39 (24%) patients were treated with only erythropoietin.

,"33363152"," The Role of Eryptosis in the Pathogenesis of Renal Anemia: Insights From Basic Research and Mathematical Modeling. ","Dias G. et al.","Red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant cells in the blood. Despite powerful defense systems against chemical and mechanical stressors, their life span is limited to about 120 days in healthy humans and further shortened in patients with kidney failure. Changes in the cell membrane potential and cation permeability trigger a cascade of events that lead to exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the RBC membrane. The translocation of phosphatidylserine is an important step in a process that eventually results in eryptosis, the programmed death of an RBC. The regulation of eryptosis is complex and involves several cellular pathways, such as the regulation of non-selective cation channels. Increased cytosolic calcium concentration results in scramblase and floppase activation, exposing phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, leading to early clearance of RBCs from the circulation by phagocytic cells. While eryptosis is physiologically meaningful to recycle iron and other RBC constituents in healthy subjects, it is augmented under pathological conditions, such as kidney failure. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, the number of eryptotic RBC is significantly increased, resulting in a shortened RBC life span that further compounds renal anemia. In CKD patients, uremic toxins, oxidative stress, hypoxemia, and inflammation contribute to the increased eryptosis rate. Eryptosis may have an impact on renal anemia, and depending on the degree of shortened RBC life span, the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents is often insufficient to attain desired hemoglobin target levels. The goal of this review is to indicate the importance of eryptosis as a process closely related to life span reduction, aggravating renal anemia.","2020","Frontiers in cell and developmental biology",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

LI","Sabe M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Although clear evidence shows that chronic kidney disease is a predictor of cardiovascular events, death, and accelerated coronary artery disease (CAD) progression, it remains unknown whether CAD is a predictor of progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease. We sought to assess whether CAD adds prognostic information to established predictors of progression to dialysis in patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and anemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the previously described Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) population, we compared baseline characteristics of patients with and without CAD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between CAD and the outcomes of end-stage renal disease and the composite of death or end-stage renal disease. Of the 4038 patients, 1791 had a history of known CAD. These patients were older (mean age 70 versus 65 years, P<0.001) and more likely to have other cardiovascular disease. CAD patients were less likely to have marked proteinuria (29% versus 39%, P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate between the 2 groups. After adjusting for age, sex, race, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, treatment group, and 14 other renal risk factors, patients with CAD were significantly more likely to progress to end-stage renal disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.20 [95% CI 1.01-1.42], P=0.04) and to have the composite of death or end-stage renal disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.15 [95% CI 1.01-1.30], P=0.03).

We aimed to assess clinical associates and pathophysiological pathways related to ID in this multimorbid syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 2151 patients with HF from the BIOSTAT-CHF cohort. Patients were stratified based on ID (transferrin saturation <20%), anaemia (World Health Organization definition) and/or CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ). Patients were mainly men (73.3%), with a median age of 70.5 (interquartile range 61.4-78.1). ID was more prevalent than CKD and anaemia (63.3%, 47.2% and 35.6% respectively), with highest prevalence in those with concomitant CKD and anaemia (77.5% vs. 59.3%; p < 0.001). There was a considerable overlap in biomarkers and pathways between patients with isolated ID, anaemia or CKD, or in combination, with processes related to immunity, inflammation, cell survival and cancer amongst the common pathways. Key biomarkers shared between syndromes with ID included transferrin receptor, interleukin-6, fibroblast growth factor-23, and bone morphogenetic protein 6. Having ID, either alone or on top of anaemia and/or CKD, was associated with a lower overall summary Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, an impaired 6-min walk test and increased incidence of hospitalizations and/or mortality in multivariable analyses (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency, CKD and/or anaemia in patients with HF have great overlap in biomarker profiles, suggesting common pathways associated with these syndromes.

","Sonkar S. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Anemia is common in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and diabetes is a major leading risk factor for it. In Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD), it worsens more, which further increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite of adequate iron stores anemia persist, which may be due to impaired iron release from body stores that is unable to meet the demand for erythropoiesis (also called reticuloendothelial cell iron blockade). High parathyroid hormone (PTH) along with vitamin D, may be attributable for anemia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 150 advanced (Stage 4 & 5) pre dialyzed DKD patients (GFR <30ml/min/1.73 m2), aged 40-70 years were included over a period of 1 year. Any other concomitant illness/ drugs leading to anemia were excluded. Serum samples were collected and urea, creatinine, hemoglobin, iron profile, vitamin D, iPTH, uric acid, calcium, phosphorous and albumin levels were measured. A data base was constructed on Microsoft Excel 2007 and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM, NY, USA). RESULTS: Stage 5 DKD had more pronounced anemia compared to stage 4 DKD (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin (Hb) was inversely correlated with iPTH (r = -0.74, P < 0.001) and was associated with vitamin D deficiency (r = 0.51, P < 0.001) but not with serum ferritin. DKD patients with low eGFR (r = -0.6, P < 0.001), vitamin D (r = -0.43, P < 0.001) and serum calcium (r = -0.37, P < 0.001) had higher iPTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (beta=-0.005; P < 0.001) and Vitamin D (beta=0.053; P < 0.01) were strong predictor for Hb while parameters of iron profile was not statistically significant.

The main aim of this study is to evaluate how anemia is related with the most commonly used drugs in a large sample of NH residents. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in a sample of Italian long-term care NHs distributed throughout the country. RESULTS: In all, 2602 NH residents recruited from 27 Italian long-term NHs (mean age ± SD: 88.4 ± 8.5) and 441 (16.9%) had a diagnosis of anemia. The unadjusted model showed a significant relation with PPI (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.39-2.11, p < 0.0001). This relation was maintained in the model adjusted for age, sex, CKD, atrophic gastritis, peptic ulcer and rheumatic disease (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.31-1.99, p < 0.0001).

","Kuwahara M. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Anemia is a common complication of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which not only lowers their quality of life but also potentially causes cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and coronary heart disease, and accelerates the progression of renal dysfunction. METHODS: Pre-dialysis patients were assigned to groups A, B, C or D based on hemoglobin levels of ≤ 8.9 (n = 48), 9.0-9.9 (n = 63), 10-10.9 (n = 53), and ≥ 11.0 g/dL (n = 39), respectively. Cardiac function was estimated using echocardiography to clarify the relationship between anemia and cardiac disorders in patients with CKD immediately before starting hemodialysis. RESULTS: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly higher in group D than in groups A and B. The fractions with an LVEF of less than 50% were 16.7, 4.8, 1.9, and 0% in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Posterior wall thickness was statistically thicker and the deceleration time of the early diastolic wave was longer in groups A and B, respectively, than in groups C and D. The left ventricular mass index in group D was significantly lower than in any other groups. CONCLUSION: Anemia in pre-dialysis patients with CKD is a probable cause of impaired left ventricular systolic function and progressive left ventricular hypertrophy.

","Maruno S. et al.","Anemia is a significant complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), caused by erythropoietin deficiency and reduced iron availability. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have been used with iron supplementation to treat anemia; however, they are associated with some problems. Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) is a promising new class of oral therapy for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD. HIF-PHI inhibits HIF-prolyl hydroxylase enzymes and results in the HIF-α accumulation, which leads to increased expression of HIF-responsive genes, including erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). HIF stimulates endogenous erythropoietin production and also reduces circulating hepcidin concentrations, resulting in improved anemia. Many clinical trials demonstrate that HIF-PHI improves anemia in patients with CKD and on dialysis. In addition to treating anemia, HIF-PHI may have multiple potential effects. Several animal experiments show that HIF-PHI protects against ischemic kidney damage that progresses to CKD and also improves metabolic disorders and ameliorates cardiovascular complications. In contrast, malignant tumor and retinopathy should be carefully evaluated due to theoretical concerns that HIF stabilization may result in increased VEGF protein expression. Some adverse events such as shunt occlusion reported in large clinical trials also need attention and warrant further investigations.","2021","[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This study investigated the therapeutic equivalence between lyophilized powder and standard liquid EPO alfa by subcutaneous (SC) administration in hemoglobin maintenance among patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: This was a single-blinded, randomized, controlled, single-center, parallel-group study regarding the treatment of anemia among CKD patients on hemodialysis and being treated with stable doses of EPO alfa at least for 12 weeks. Anemic hemodialysis patients (n=63) received standard liquid or lyophilized powder EPO alfa for 24 weeks by SC administration. Achievement of the target hemoglobin concentration and safety and tolerability end points were documented. RESULTS: Baseline mean hemoglobin level was 11.1±0.7 g/dL using lyophilized powder EPO alfa and 11.2±0.9 g/dL using standard liquid EPO alfa. The baseline median dose of EPO alfa was 126.4 (interquartile range [IQR] 81.6-163.6) U/kg/week in the lyophilized powder EPO alfa group and 116.9 (IQR 76.5-144.1) U/kg/week in the standard liquid EPO alfa group.

The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the RCTs most relevant to clinical decision-making. RECENT FINDINGS: The Trial to Reduce cardiovascular Events with Aransep Therapy (TREAT) is the biggest and best designed RCT performed so far, enrolling 4038 diabetic patients with CKD in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Comparing the high hemoglobin (Hb) darbopoietin group with placebo, it reported no difference in cardiac and renal outcomes, a significantly increased risk of stroke, and modest improvement in fatigue and transfusion rate. Meta-analysis demonstrated that correction of anemia with ESA was associated with a significantly increased risk of hypertension and vascular access clotting and an increased risk of death that approached statistical significance. Quality-of-life improvements appeared to maximize in the target Hb range of 10-12 g/dl. SUMMARY: Treatment of renal anemia using ESAs to target Hb higher than 13 g/dl is harmful. Treatment of Hb below 9 g/dl provides substantial transfusion and quality-of-life benefits, but safety is unknown. Target Hb levels of 10-12 g/dl seem reasonable, but increasing ESA doses in hyporesponsive patients to achieve a specific target is not.","2011","Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Recent randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) have reported risks and benefits in the correction of anemia using erythropoietin-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) in patients with predialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) or end-stage renal disease ","Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Soluble transferrin (sTfR), interleukin (IL)-6, cystatin C, and hepcidin receptors were measured using commercially available kits. According to the World Health Organization definition, the prevalence of anemia was 40%.

Assuming that level of renal function and anemia are strongly correlated, posttransplantation anemia (PTA) may have a different impact depending on the stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: This study is a retrospective multicenter analysis using the DIVAT French database. The prevalence, risk factors, and influence of 12-month PTA (World Health Organization's definition) on patient and graft survival were analyzed according to CKD stage (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation). RESULTS: The prevalence of 12-month PTA in our cohort of 4217 patients was 41.1%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that worse renal function, donor age, period of transplantation, induction therapy, and mTOR inhibitors were significant risk factors for PTA. Posttransplantation anemia was a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality in CKD stages 1 to 2T (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.99-4.40) and 3T (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.15) and for cardiovascular mortality only on CKD stages 1T and 2T.

In this study, we evaluated the correlation and accuracy of these 2 measures of glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients with CKD stages 3-4. STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic test study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Type 2 diabetic patients with normal (n = 30) and abnormal kidney function (n = 30) were recruited in Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. INDEX TESTS: HbA(1c) and fructosamine. REFERENCE TEST: Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. MEASUREMENTS: Blood glucose measurements consisted of 6 preprandial, 6 postprandial, and 2 bedtime assessments in a week with a cycle of 4-week intervals for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Correlation coefficients between HbA(1c) level or fructosamine-albumin ratio and mean blood glucose levels were 0.836 and 0.645 in participants with normal kidney function and 0.813 and 0.649 in participants with CKD stages 3-4, respectively.

Patients with profound anemia suffer from symptoms of fatigue, poor energy, weakness, and shortness of breath. Such symptoms reported directly by patients, or patient-reported outcomes (PROs), may be a valuable tool to target ESA treatment in anemic CKD patients. Studies show that improvements in anemia correlate with improvements in these PRO domains in some individuals. We propose that instead of Hb targets for all patients, treatment of anemia should be directed toward improving the areas of patient-perceived quality of life most affected by anemia. PROs can be used by individual patients to prioritize the risks and benefits of ESA treatment.

The presence of ESA resistance cannot always be explained by the known risk factors of the condition, suggesting that additional factors may be involved. We wanted to test the hypothesis that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with lower hemoglobin (Hb) and ESA resistance in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: Data from patients receiving maintenance HD in a single dialysis center were extracted from the medical records in a retrospective chart review. Basic patient characteristics and laboratory data including Hb, serum albumin, intact parathyroid hormone and serum 25(OH)-cholecalciferol (25(OH)D(3)) levels were collected. ESA dose and Kt/V were extracted from the dialysis charts. Correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to reveal potential independent associations between clinical and laboratory parameters and ESA resistance. RESULTS: Data from 142 patients were analyzed. Serum 25(OH)D(3) concentration was significantly correlated with Hb (ρ = 0.186, p < 0.05) and also with ESA dose/Hb index (ρ = 0.230, p < 0.01). In multivariable regression analyses, serum 25(OH)D(3) concentration remained significantly associated with both Hb and ESA dose/Hb index after controlling for potentially important confounders.

Possible healthcare cost savings, which have not been demonstrated in a long-term study, may be an additional advantage of using such multi-pronged treatment strategies for the control of both hyperphosphatemia and iron needs. It is currently assumed that oral iron supplementation is less efficient than the IV route in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The unexpected efficacy of novel iron-containing phosphate binders, such as ferric citrate, in repleting insufficient iron stores and improving the anemia of CKD could change this view. Previous assumptions of self-controlled iron uptake by 'mucosal block' or hepcidin, or else by impaired intestinal iron absorption due to CKD-associated inflammation cannot be reconciled with recent observations of the effects of ferric citrate administration. Citrate in the intestinal lumen may partly contribute to the acceleration of iron absorption. Animal experiments and clinical studies have also shown that oral iron overload can cause excessive iron accumulation despite high hepcidin levels, which are not able to block iron absorption completely. However, like with IV iron agents, no long-term safety data exist with respect to the effects of iron-containing phosphate binders on 'hard' patient outcomes. Future randomized prospective studies in patients with CKD are necessary to establish the safety of oral iron-containing phosphate binders for the control of both hyperphosphatemia and renal anemia.","2016","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Methods: This was a cross-sectional approach to the baseline data of the Birjand longitudinal aging study (BLAS) in which 1396 people aged ≥ 60 years were screened for the presence of anemia based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. For each participant, a standard questionnaire was administered. Furthermore, the height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were calculated. Blood samples were obtained from each participant for hematological examination. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other indices of cell blood count were measured using an automatic cell counter. The prevalence rates were estimated using survey analysis with the weight of Birjand county older population. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to detect the associated factor with anemia. Results: The mean age of the participants was 69.73±7.66 years. The crude prevalence of anemia was 11.10%, and the age-standardized prevalence based on the standard WHO population 2000-2025 was equal to 16.78% (12.81%-21.66%) (15.95% [10.41%-23.69%] in women and 17.32% (12.65%-23.25%) in men.

,"17098634"," Practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of anemia associated with CKD in elderly. ","Agarwal A.","Anemia is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Inadequate production of erythropoietin by the failing kidneys leads to decreased stimulation of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells (RBCs). Anemia of CKD develops early and worsens with progressive renal insufficiency. Although over 40% of patients with CKD are anemic, anemia in this population is under-recognized and undertreated. Of considerable importance, anemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Despite the availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating proteins (ESPs) to stimulate RBC production in CKD patients, approximately three fourths of patients initiating dialysis have a hemoglobin <11 g/dL. The recognition of anemia of CKD begins with an estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which can be far lower than a normal serum creatinine might suggest, especially in the elderly and in those with poor nutrition and muscle mass. If GFR is <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), hemoglobin should be checked. The anemia is diagnosed when the hemoglobin is <12 g/dL in a man or a postmenopausal woman, or <11 g/dL in a premenopausal woman. The cause of anemia should be investigated in these individuals; this can range from erythropoietin deficiency due to CKD, to deficiency of vitamin B(12) and/or folate, iron deficiency, blood loss, inflammation, malignancy, and aluminum intoxication. After other causes of anemia have been excluded, CKD is the most likely etiology, and it should be treated with an ESP. Currently, epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are the only 2 ESPs approved for use in the United States. Extended dosing of ESP has potential advantages for the patient and may also improve resource utilization. Consequently, both agents have been tested for dosing at extended intervals. Adequate iron stores--defined as transferrin saturation >20% and ferritin >100 mg--as well as ESP administration are needed to produce an appropriate increase in hemoglobin. Poor response to treatment with ESP can be due to many factors, including presence of iron deficiency, inflammation, continued blood loss, and hemoglobinopathy.","2006","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Descriptive statistics were reported separately based on the presence or absence of anemia. RESULTS: In total, 410 patients (anemia: n=190, no anemia: n=220) and 258 care partners (anemia: n=110, no anemia: n=148) completed the survey. Most patients reported receiving paid or unpaid care because of their health condition (anemia: 58.9%, no anemia: 50.9%), with an overall average of 14.2 and 11.3 h/wk among the anemia and no anemia patients, respectively. The care partners also reported providing numerous hours of care (anemia: 33.6 h/wk, no anemia: 38.0 h/wk), especially care partners living with their care recipient (anemia: 52.6 h/wk, no anemia: 42.8 h/wk). Among the patients, those with anemia reported a numerically lower average health-related quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia score, anemia: 110.1; no anemia: 121.6). Most care partners reported a severe or very severe burden (Burden Scale for Family Caregivers-Short Version score≥15, anemia: 69.1%; no anemia: 58.8%). The work productivity impairment was substantial among employed patients (anemia: 44.9%, no anemia: 35.4%) and employed care partners (anemia: 47.9%, no anemia: 40.7%). LIMITATIONS: The survey results may have been subject to selection and recall biases; moreover, the observational nature of the study does not allow for causal inferences. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CKD and the care partners of patients with CKD experience a considerable burden, especially when anemia is present.","2022","Kidney medicine","RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE : Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) has a far-reaching impact on both patients and care partners , which can be further compounded by frequent complications such as anemia ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The aim of this chapter is to determine the extent to which the UK Renal Association (RA) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for anaemia management are met in the UK. METHODS: Quarterly data were obtained for haemoglobin (Hb) and factors that influence Hb from UK renal centres for the incident and prevalent renal replacement therapy (RRT) cohorts for 2012. RESULTS: In the UK, in 2012, 51% of patients commenced dialysis therapy with Hb 100 g/L (median Hb 100 g/L). Of patients in the early presentation group, 54% started dialysis with Hb 100 g/L whilst 34% of patients presenting late started dialysis with Hb 100 g/L. The UK median Hb of haemodialysis (HD) patients was 112 g/L, with 82% of patients having Hb 100 g/L. The median Hb of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in the UK was 114 g/L, with 85% of patients having Hb 100 g/L. The median ferritin in HD patients in the UK was 431 µg/L and 95% of HD patients had a ferritin 100 µg/L. In EW&NI the median ferritin in PD patients was 285 µg/L (IQR 164-466) with 88% of PD patients having a ferritin 100 µg/L. In EW&NI the median ESA dose was higher for HD than PD patients (7,248 vs. 4,250 IU/week). The percentage of patients treated with an ESA and having Hb >120 g/L ranged between centres from 7-39% for HD and from 0-33% for PD.

Survival models were examined to assess the association between hemoglobin increments and mortality in a 6-year cohort of 2,402 PKD and 110,875 non-PKD hemodialysis patients across infrequent versus frequent ESA therapy defined as ESA < 25% of cohort time versus otherwise, respectively. Mortality risk was estimated by Cox proportional regression [hazard ratio (HR) and 95% of confidence interval] analysis. Patients with PKD were aged 58 ± 13 years and included 46% women 14% Blacks, respectively. Fully adjusted death HRs of time-averaged hemoglobin increments <11.0, 12.0 to <13.0 g/dL (reference: 11.0 to <12.0 g/dL) for frequent ESA therapy were 2.57 (1.48-4.48), 0.60 (0.43-0.82), and 0.81 (0.50-1.29), whereas for infrequent ESA therapy they were 1.33 (0.47-3.78), 0.28 (0.13-0.61), and 0.22 (0.09-0.57), respectively. Hence, in patients with PKD who require infrequent ESA, incrementally higher achieved hemoglobin including > 13.0 g/dL exhibits better survival; this incremental survival gain of higher hemoglobin is not observed in patients with PKD receiving frequent ESA administration, in whom hemoglobin concentration > 13 exhibits increased mortality.","2012","American journal of hematology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

A total of 83 patients with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD) on peritoneal dialysis for more than 3 months, on once-monthly subcutaneous CERA treatment, were followed up over a period of 1 year. Efficacy evaluation included Hb levels, mean time in which the Hb level was maintained within target range, CERA doses and number of dose changes.

","da S. et al.","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to: (i) investigate the effect of six months of resistance training (RT) on body composition, muscle strength, hematological patterns, and redox profile in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients, and; (ii) evaluate the effects of baseline concentrations of hemoglobin on the RT response. METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomly allocated into two groups: Control [CTL, (n = 76)] and RT (n = 81). A first visit was required for anamnesis and anthropometric measurements. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and after twenty-four weeks of training in all patients for the analysis of clinical and redox balance markers. The RT program spanned six months and consisted of three sets of 8-12 repetitions with a rating of perceived exertion between 5 and 8 for three weekly sessions. Each exercise session was performed in twelve resistance exercises and it least for approximately 40 min. RESULTS: The main results demonstrated that RT decreased waist circumference by 3%, and decreased thiobarbituric reactive species (TBARS) by 28%. Moreover, RT increased handgrip strength by 28.4%, fat-free mass by 4.1%, hemoglobin by 5%, iron by 33.4%, glutathione by 121%, and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity by 14.2% (p < 0.05). Low hemoglobin concentrations impaired the effect of RT on fat-free mass gain. CONCLUSION: Six months of RT in HD patients improved clinical parameters, such as hemoglobin, iron, body composition, and redox balance, while low hemoglobin concentration impaired exercise-benefits on fat-free mass in patients with CKD. These findings can contribute to a better clinical application of RT in the maintenance of hemodialysis patients.","2021","Frontiers in physiology"," The purpose of this study was to : ( i ) investigate the effect of six months of resistance training ( RT ) on body composition , muscle strength , hematological patterns , and redox profile in maintenance hemodialysis ( HD ) patients , and ; ( ii ) evaluate the effects","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

It is caused by crythropoietin deficency and is associated with adverse outcomes in CKD patients. Renal anemia should be treated with erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), supplementary iron, adequate dialysis, and if necessary with red blood cells transfusions. The main problem of treatment is how to determine target hemoglobin value and keep it within the constant range. Current guidelines recommend target hemoglobin level 110 - 120 g/l, but optimal value need to be adjusted for every patient individualy keeping in mind primary kidney disease, age, gender and comorbidities. In Department of Dialysis of General Hospital Bjelovar we carried out a retrospective study about treating renal anemia in 67 patients on chronic hemodialysis program during 36 months in a period from 2007. til 2010. We monitored hemoglobin, feritin, saturation of transferin (TSAT), dose of LSE, number of change in dosage and number of transfusion. Mean hemoglobin level was 107.8 g/l, feritin level 196.8 mcg/l, TSAT 24.16%, weekly dose of ESAs 5951.9 IU. in 53.7% patiens dose was changed 11 - 20 times during that period, and 34% of patiens was treated with at least 1 dose of transfusion of red blood cells.

The anemia etiologies analyzed were chronic kidney disease (CKD), nutritional deficiencies (ND), anemia of inflammation (AI), anemia of multiple causes (AMC) and unexplained anemia (UEA). VAD was considered to be s-retinol ≤ 20 μg/dL, and VDD if 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L. IL-6 and hepcidin were also measured. Multinomial regression models were generated and adjusted for confounders. Anemia was present in 35.7% of OA, independent of sex. UEA, CKD, AI and ND were confirmed in 45%, 29.3%, 14.6% and 7% of older adults with anemia, respectively.

RESULTS: A total of 615 eligible cases were included. The mean age of patients was 64.1±12.0 years. The prevalence of anemia was 75.8%, and the severity of anemia was mild in 47.7% of the patients, moderate in 32.2%, and severe in 20%. Based on morphological classification of anemia, 76.9% of our patients had normochromic-normocytic anemia whereas 21.8 and 1.3% had hypochromic-microcytic anemia and macrocytic anemia, respectively. Oral iron supplements were prescribed to 38.0% of the patients and none of the patients was given erythropoietin stabilizing agents (ESA) or intravenous iron preparations. In logistic regression, significant predictors of anti-anemic preparation use were decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and advanced stages of CKD. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that the prevalence of anemia in pre-dialysis patients is higher than currently accepted and it is found to be correlated with renal function; prevalence increases with declined renal function.

","Ganz T. et al.","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for infection, attributable to immune dysfunction, increased exposure to infectious agents, loss of cutaneous barriers, comorbid conditions, and treatment-related factors (eg, hemodialysis and immunosuppressant therapy). Because iron plays a vital role in pathogen reproduction and host immunity, it is biologically plausible that intravenous iron therapy and/or iron deficiency influence infection risk in CKD. Available data from preclinical experiments, observational studies, and randomized controlled trials are summarized to explore the interplay between intravenous iron and infection risk among patients with CKD, particularly those receiving maintenance hemodialysis. The current evidence base, including data from a recent randomized controlled trial, suggests that proactive judicious use of intravenous iron (in a manner that minimizes the accumulation of non-transferrin-bound iron) beneficially replaces iron stores while avoiding a clinically relevant effect on infection risk. In the absence of an urgent clinical need, intravenous iron therapy should be avoided in patients with active infection. Although serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation can help guide clinical decision making about intravenous iron therapy, definition of an optimal iron status and its precise determination in individual patients remain clinically challenging in CKD and warrant additional study.","2020","Kidney medicine",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Previous studies on the consistent benefits of glycemic control in diabetic nephropathy focused primarily on delaying microalbuminuria. However, this effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remains controversial. This study aims to establish a model that explains the controversial effects of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) on GFR. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study followed subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who were enrolled between June 2006 and December 2006, for 4 years. The effects of HbA1C on estimated GFR (eGFR) were examined both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The dual effects of HbA1C on eGFR, and how renal function interferes with these effects, were investigated. RESULTS: Of the 1,992 subjects enrolled, 1,699 completed the follow-up. HbA1C was positively correlated with eGFR in the cross-sectional study (β coefficient = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.71-2.17, p = 0.0001). In the longitudinal study, higher baseline HbA1C resulted in a greater decline in eGFR. The annual eGFR decline rates were -1.89, -1.29, and -0.68 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year for baseline HbA1C >9, 7 to ≤9, and ≤7%, respectively. The eGFR value was simultaneously affected by concurrent (β coefficient = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.48-1.08, p < 0.0001) and preceding HbA1C (-0.52, -0.82 to -0.23, p < 0.0001). The positive effects of concurrent HbA1C on eGFR reached statistical significance at all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the negative effects of preceding HbA1C only applied to CKD stages 3 and 4. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new model that demonstrates how preceding and concurrent HbA1C simultaneously affect eGFR in opposing ways. The dynamic effects varied among different CKD stages. The deterioration in eGFR at CKD stages 3 and 4 may be postponed by intensive glycemic control. Further prospective studies may be necessary to clarify the specific CKD stage(s) that will benefit from intensive glycemic control.","2013","American journal of nephrology"," This study aims to establish a model that explains the controversial effects of glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) on GFR ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Garrido P. et al.","Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that develops early and its severity increases as renal function declines. It is mainly due to a reduced production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the kidneys; however, there are evidences that iron metabolism disturbances increase as CKD progresses. Our aim was to study the mechanisms underlying the development of anemia of CKD, as well as renal damage, in the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. This model of CKD presented a sustained degree of renal dysfunction, with mild and advanced glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions. Anemia developed 3 weeks after nephrectomy and persisted throughout the protocol. The remnant kidney was still able to produce EPO and the liver showed an increased EPO gene expression. In spite of the increased EPO blood levels, anemia persisted and was linked to low serum iron and transferrin levels, while serum interleukin (IL)-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels showed the absence of systemic inflammation. The increased expression of duodenal ferroportin favours iron absorption; however, serum iron is reduced which might be due to iron leakage through advanced kidney lesions, as showed by tubular iron accumulation. Our data suggest that the persistence of anemia may result from disturbances in iron metabolism and by an altered activity/function of EPO as a result of kidney cell damage and a local inflammatory milieu, as showed by the increased gene expression of different inflammatory proteins in the remnant kidney. In addition, this anemia and the associated kidney hypoxia favour the development of fibrosis, angiogenesis and inflammation that may underlie a resistance to EPO stimuli and reduced iron availability. These findings might contribute to open new windows to identify putative therapeutic targets for this condition, as well as for recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) resistance, which occurs in a considerable percentage of CKD patients.","2015","PloS one"," Our aim was to study the mechanisms underlying the development of anemia of CKD , as well as renal damage , in the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5 / 6 nephrectomy ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Flamme I. et al.","Oxygen sensing by hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PHs) is the dominant regulatory mechanism of erythropoietin (EPO) expression. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), impaired EPO expression causes anemia, which can be treated by supplementation with recombinant human EPO (rhEPO). However, treatment can result in rhEPO levels greatly exceeding the normal physiological range for endogenous EPO, and there is evidence that this contributes to hypertension in patients with CKD. Mimicking hypoxia by inhibiting HIF-PHs, thereby stabilizing HIF, is a novel treatment concept for restoring endogenous EPO production. HIF stabilization by oral administration of the HIF-PH inhibitor BAY 85-3934 (molidustat) resulted in dose-dependent production of EPO in healthy Wistar rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In repeat oral dosing of BAY 85-3934, hemoglobin levels were increased compared with animals that received vehicle, while endogenous EPO remained within the normal physiological range. BAY 85-3934 therapy was also effective in the treatment of renal anemia in rats with impaired kidney function and, unlike treatment with rhEPO, resulted in normalization of hypertensive blood pressure in a rat model of CKD. Notably, unlike treatment with the antihypertensive enalapril, the blood pressure normalization was achieved without a compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, BAY 85-3934 may provide an approach to the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD, without the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects seen for patients treated with rhEPO.

However, the effects of PHD inhibitors and rHuEPO on blood pressure and CKD in animal models susceptible to hypertension and nephropathy have not been studied. The present study compared the effects of dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), a PHD inhibitor, and rHuEPO on the development of hypertension and renal injury in Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed an 8% salt diet for 3 weeks. DMOG and rHuEPO were equally effective at raising hemoglobin levels. Systolic blood pressure rose to a greater extent in rHuEPO-treated rats (267 ± 10 vs. 226 ± 4 mm Hg) than in rats given DMOG (189 ± 8 mm Hg). Urinary protein excretion increased to 568 ± 54 versus 353 ± 25 mg/day in rats treated with rHuEPO and vehicle; however, it only rose to 207 ± 21 mg/day in rats receiving DMOG. DMOG significantly attenuated the degree of glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis as compared with that in vehicle and rHuEPO-treated rats. This was associated with lower renal levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1β and increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression in cortex and medulla. These results indicate that DMOG and rHuEPO are equally effective in increasing hemoglobin levels in Dahl S rats; however, rHuEPO aggravates hypertension and renal injury, whereas DMOG has marked renoprotective effects. These results suggest that PHD inhibitors may have a therapeutic advantage for the treatment of anemia in CKD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors are in phase 3 clinical trials as alternatives to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present study reveals that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), a PHD inhibitor, and rHuEPO are equally effective in increasing hemoglobin levels in Dahl S rats; however, rHuEPO aggravated hypertension and renal injury, whereas DMOG attenuated the development of hypertension and prevented renal injury.

,"25351027"," [Efficacy and tolerability of ferric carboxymaltose in geriatric patients with anemia. Data from three non-interventional studies]. ","Röhrig G. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia in the elderly is a common clinical finding. Prevalence in hospitalized geriatric patients approximates up to 40% presenting as iron deficiency anemia associated with absolute iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease associated with functional iron deficiency or unexplained anemia. In patients with functional iron deficiency oral iron substitution is ineffective due to elevated hepcidin levels, such as in renal anemia. In these patients intravenous iron substitution represents a cornerstone. However, data among geriatric patients are limited. We conducted three non-interventional studies collecting data with respect to efficacy and tolerance of ferric carboxymaltose (ferinject) in three patient groups (cancer, chronic kidney disease [CKD], chronic inflammatory bowel disease [CIBD]) with anemia and functional iron deficiency. The present sub-analysis describes the results among the geriatric patients (age > 70 years) observed in all three observational studies. PATIENTS, METHODS: 264 patients were analyzed (mean age of 76.9 years [70-90 years; SD +/- 5.2 years]). Patients received an average amount of 1200 mg ferric carboxymaltose (746-1575 mg). RESULTS: Hemoglobin levels (p < 0.001), serum ferritin (p < 0.001) and transferrin saturation (p < 0.05) rose significantly in CKD patients; in CIBD patients hemoglobin and transferrin saturation rose significantly (p < 0.05) while the rise of ferritin failed to be significant. In oncologic patients the rise of hemoglobin and ferritin levels was of high statistic significance (p < 0.001) and transferrin saturation also rose significantly (p = 0.02) Fatigue, mental capacities as well as dyspnea improved among CKD-and CIBD-groups. No severe adverse reactions occurred. CONCLUSION: Administration of ferric carboxymaltose in geriatric patients is well tolerated and offers an effective treatment option for the treatment of functional iron deficiency.","2014","MMW Fortschritte der Medizin",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This study sought to determine whether high-flux dialysis would help improve markers of renal anemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress compared with low-flux dialysis. DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In a prospective, controlled study, 221 patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and receiving darbepoetin-alfa treatment (mean age, 66 years; 55% male) from 19 centers were screened in a 20-week run-in period of low-flux hemodialysis with a synthetic dialysis membrane. Thereafter, 166 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a synthetic high-flux membrane or to continue on low-flux dialysis for 52 weeks. Data on myeloperoxidase, oxidized LDL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and the Malnutrition Inflammation Score were collected at baseline and after 52 weeks; routine laboratory data, such as hemoglobin, ferritin, and albumin, and the use of darbepoetin-alfa, were also measured in the run-in period. Results After 52 weeks, the low-flux and the high-flux groups did not differ with respect to hemoglobin (mean ± SD, 11.7±0.9 g/dl versus 11.7±1.1 g/dl; P=0.62) or use of darbepoetin-alfa (mean dosage ± SD, 29.8±24.8 μg/wk versus 26.0±31.1 μg/wk; P=0.85). Markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, or nutritional status also did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Over 1 year, high-flux dialysis had no superior effects on hemoglobin levels or markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status.

","Singh A. and Hertello P.","It is important for nephrology nurses to understand the relationship that exists between renal disease, cardiac disease, and anemia. Even mild cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been associated with an increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. And anemia, which can result from both CKD and congestive heart failure, has been shown to exacerbate the adverse consequences of these conditions. An early, aggressive correction of anemia in patients with CKD can be implemented to break this cycle and stop disease progression. Studies have shown that anemia correction improves both cardiac and renal function and can result in increased hemoglobin levels, decreased number of hospital days, and improved quality of life. An effective strategy for managing anemia in patients with renal disease and comorbid cardiovascular disease includes the administration of both recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron. In addition, the nephrology nurse plays an integral role in managing anemia and improving outcomes in these patients. Therefore, the nephrology nurse should have an increased awareness of the link between anemia and renal/cardiac disease as well as available treatment options.","2005","Nephrology nursing journal : journal of the American Nephrology Nurses' Association",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Recent studies have shown that uremic toxins produced by the gut microbiota also may play a role in the genesis of anemia in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible association between uremic toxins plasma levels and anemia in patients with CKD on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated one hundred fifty-four patients (53.2% men, 51.2 ± 11.2 years, hemoglobin (Hb) levels of 11.2 ± 1.6 g/dL). Biochemical variables such as urea, creatinine, hemoglobin, hematocrit, were measured according to standard methods and uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS) plasma levels were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). RESULTS: The levels of uremic toxins such as IS, IAA, p-CS were increased in all patients. However, no correlation was found between uremic toxins plasma levels and anemia parameters. Only patients with Hb < 11 g/dL presented a negative correlation between hematocrit and IAA plasma levels.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 13 patients (9 women and 4 men) aged 64.8 +/- 8.9 years with serum creatinine of 3.82 +/- 1.30 mg/dl and Hb concentration of 10.02 +/- 0.45 g/dl. rHuEpo was given in the mean dose of 2296 +/- 673 U/week s.c. to achieve Hb 12 g/dl. At baseline and after 6 months of rHuEpo therapy echocardiography and renoscintigraphy were performed. RESULTS: After 6 months' therapy Hb increased significantly, while blood pressure did not change significantly. Renal anemia correction led to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, stroke volume index and cardiac index. Total peripheral vascular resistance index increased significantly. At the same time a significantly reduced left ventricular mass index was observed. Correction of renal anemia and changes in systemic hemodynamics did not exert unfavorable effect on renal hemodynamic parameters. GFR index, blood flow rate index, renal vascular resistance index and filtration fraction remained unchanged. During rHuEpo therapy decline in renal function expressed as 1/serum creatinine did not differ compared with a 6-month period before initiating rHuEpo therapy.

METHODS: Between 2000 and 2013, we enrolled 370 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy for nonmetastatic UTUC. Preoperative anemia was defined as hemoglobin <130g/l in men and <120g/l in women based on the World Health Organization classification. Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the effect anemia on survival, and hazard ratios (HR) of anemia and other clinicopathological parameters were evaluated by Cox regression model. The analyses were also performed in patients with different chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. RESULTS: In all, 242 (65.4%) patients were anemic before surgery. Those with preoperative anemia had worse CKD stage (P<0.001) and higher pathological tumor stage (P = 0.023). In univariate analysis, metastasis-free and cancer-specific survival rates were not significantly associated with preoperative anemia (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 0.93-2.44, P = 0.093 and HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 0.93-2.72, PP = 0.094, respectively). However, in patients without stage 5 CKD, those with preoperative anemia had apparently inferior metastasis-free and cancer-specific survival than those without (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.14-3.01, P = 0.014 and HR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.16-3.56, P = 0.010, respectively). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model indicated that preoperative anemia was an independent predictor for both metastasis-free (HR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.21-3.90, P = 0.010) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.15-4.21, P = 0.017).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of CKD. The association between admission hemoglobin levels and renal damage in patients with T2DM remains unclear. AIM: To evaluate the relationship between admission hemoglobin levels and prognosis in patients with T2DM. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 265 consecutive patients presenting with T2DM between 2011 and 2015. The composite endpoint was end-stage renal disease or a 50% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (adjusting for demographic factors, traditional risk factors, lipids), the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the highest and middle tertiles compared to the lowest tertile of hemoglobin were 0.82 (95%CI: 0.11-6.26, P = 0.8457) and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.09-0.85, P = 0.0246), respectively. However, after further adjustment for glycaemia control, hemoglobin was positively related to the risk of the composite endpoint (HR: 1.05, 95%CI: 0.14-8.09, P = 0.9602) when the highest tertile was compared to the lowest tertile of hemoglobin. We found a U-shaped relationship between hemoglobin levels and the composite endpoint. The curve tended to reach the lowest level at an optimal hemoglobin level. CONCLUSION: Among patients with T2DM, a U-shaped relationship was observed between hemoglobin levels and renal damage. A lower admission hemoglobin level (hemoglobin < 13.3 g/dL) is an independent predictor of renal damage.","2021","World journal of diabetes"," AIM : To evaluate the relationship between admission hemoglobin levels and prognosis in patients with T2DM ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Toblli J. and Angerosa M.","With the challenge of optimizing iron delivery, new intravenous (iv) iron-carbohydrate complexes have been developed in the last few years. A good example of these new compounds is ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), which has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients who are intolerant to oral iron or present an unsatisfactory response to oral iron, and in adult patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). FCM is a robust and stable complex similar to ferritin, which minimizes the release of labile iron during administration, allowing higher doses to be administered in a single application and with a favorable cost-effective rate. Cumulative information from randomized, controlled, multicenter trials on a diverse range of indications, including patients with chronic heart failure, postpartum anemia/abnormal uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, NDD-CKD, and those undergoing hemodialysis, supports the efficacy of FCM for iron replacement in patients with iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Furthermore, as FCM is a dextran-free iron-carbohydrate complex (which has a very low risk for hypersensitivity reactions) with a small proportion of the reported adverse effects in a large number of subjects who received FCM, it may be considered a safe drug. Therefore, FCM appears as an interesting option to apply high doses of iron as a single infusion in a few minutes in order to obtain the quick replacement of iron stores. The present review on FCM summarizes diverse aspects such as pharmacology characteristics and analyzes trials on the efficacy/safety of FCM versus oral iron and different iv iron compounds in multiple clinical scenarios.

Original studies published between January 1, 2000 and March 17, 2017 meeting the following criteria were included: adult population; study focus was CKD-related anemia; included results on patients receiving iron supplementation, red blood cell transfusion, or erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs); reported results on HRQoL and/or costs. Studies which included patients with DD-CKD, did not directly compare different treatments, and had designs relevant to the objective were retained. HRQoL and cost outcomes, including healthcare resource utilization (HRU), were extracted and summarized in a narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 1,625 publications were retrieved, 15 of which met all inclusion criteria. All identified studies included ESAs as a treatment of interest. Two randomized controlled trials reported that ESA treatment improves HRQoL relative to placebo. Across eight studies comparing HRQoL of patients achieving high vs low hemoglobin (Hb) targets, aiming for higher Hb targets with ESAs generally led to modest HRQoL improvements. Two studies reported that ESA-treated patients had lower costs and HRU compared to untreated patients. One study found that aiming for higher vs lower Hb targets led to reduced HRU, while two other reported that this led to a reduction in cost-effectiveness. Limitations: Heterogeneity of study designs and outcomes; a meta-analysis could not be performed.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of roxadustat in treating CKD-induced anemia. METHODS: We searched publications online and conducted a meta-analysis and calculated relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data. RESULTS: Of 110 articles, nine were included that contained 12 data sets and 11 randomized control trials on roxadustat. In the non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) high-dose/low-dose subgroups, the change in hemoglobin (Hb) levels was significantly higher in the roxadustat group than in the placebo group (P<0.0001, P=0.001, respectively). The Hb response rate of the roxadustat is higher in the NDD subgroup than in the placebo group (P<0.00001, MD=6.92, 95% CI: 4.03, 11.89). However, in the dialysis-dependent subgroup, there was no significant difference in the change in Hb levels or the Hb response rate between the roxadustat and ESA groups. There was no change in the mortality in the roxadustat group compared to that in the placebo/ESA group. Hyperkalemia may be a side effect of roxadustat.

Least squares mean of the average hemoglobin at weeks 20 and 24 was 11.66 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 11.49 to 11.84) g/dl for vadadustat and 11.93 (95% CI, 11.76 to 12.10) g/dl for darbepoetin alfa. The 95% CIs for both treatments were within the target hemoglobin range (11.0-13.0 g/dl), and the lower 95% confidence limit for the difference between groups (-0.50 g/dl) was above the predefined noninferiority margin (-0.75 g/dl), demonstrating noninferiority of vadadustat to darbepoetin alfa. Similar proportions of patients in each group reported AEs and serious AEs. The most frequent AEs with vadadustat were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and constipation. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with NDD-CKD, vadadustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa, was effective up to week 52 in terms of average hemoglobin, and was generally well tolerated. These results suggest that vadadustat may be a potential treatment for anemia in this patient population.","2021","Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Bolarinwa R. et al.","Renal abnormalities in adult Nigerians with sickle cell anemia (SCA) have not been extensively studied. To determine the prevalence, pattern and the associated risk factors of renal disease, 72 subjects with SCA from two centers in the southwestern Nigeria were investigated. Socio-demographic data, body mass index and clinical findings were documented. The urine analysis, serum bio-chemistry, hemogram and renal factors attributable to SCA were determined. Presence of albuminuria of at least 1+ or microalbuminuria in those negative with dipstick; and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Cockcroft-Gault formula categorized subjects to various stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Subjects with and without albuminuria were compared to determine the relative risk associated with renal disease. Four (5.6%) subjects had macro-albuminuria, while 32 (44.4%) had micro-albuminuria and 30 (41.7%) had hemoglobinuria. In the subjects with albuminuria, age, hematocrit, systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, urea and creatinine clearance were numerically higher while the eGFR was numerically lower. There was no significant difference in the clinical parameters studied in the two groups of subjects. The diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the albuminuric group. Based on eGFR, 22 (30.6%) subjects had hyperfiltration (GFR > 140 mL/min/1.73 m2), of whom 36.4% had albuminuria, 18 (25.0%) had stage 1 CKD, 30 (41.7%) had stage 2 CKD and two (2.7%) subjects had stage 3 CKD with albuminuria. None had stage 4 and 5 CKD. We conclude that renal abnormalities, importantly albuminuria, is common in adult Nigerians with SCA and the pattern and incidence are similar to those reported from other parts of the world. Regular blood pressure monitoring, early diagnosis and active intervention are advocated to delay progression to end-stage kidney disease in view of poor outcomes of renal replacement therapy in SCA patients with nephropathy.","2012","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

An extension phase examined long-term safety and efficacy. METHODS: Patients were assigned to one of three C.E.R.A. dose groups determined by multiplying the previous weekly dose of epoetin by one of three ratios (0.4/150, 0.8/150, 1.2/150 for groups A, B and C, respectively). Within each group, patients were randomized to once weekly (QW), once every 3 weeks (Q3W) and once monthly (Q4W) schedules. Dose adjustments were not permitted for the first 6 weeks. The core study period was 19 weeks (21 weeks in the Q4W cohorts). Patients could enter a 12-month extension period at the same schedule, aiming to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) at 11-12 g/dL. RESULTS: 137 patients entered the core period, and 62 continued into the extension period. A dose-dependent relationship was seen in the primary efficacy variable, change in Hb standardized to a 6 week period (p < 0.0001), but effect was independent of schedule. Hb levels were maintained throughout the study, with few dose changes. C.E.R.A. was generally well tolerated and the most frequent adverse event was hypotension. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that s.c. C.E.R.A. at up to once monthly intervals provides stable maintenance of Hb levels in dialysis patients converting directly from epoetin 1-3 times/week. Achieving tight Hb control with few dose adjustments at extended administration intervals may offer health benefits and improvements in resource management.","2007","Current medical research and opinion"," AIMS : This Phase II study aimed to determine the optimal dose and administration schedule of continuous erythropoietin receptor activator ( C","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

We established a method to generate EPO-producing cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by modifying previously reported hepatic differentiation protocols. These cells showed increased EPO expression and secretion in response to low oxygen conditions, prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzyme inhibitors, and insulin-like growth factor 1. The EPO protein secreted from hiPSC-derived EPO-producing (hiPSC-EPO) cells induced the erythropoietic differentiation of human umbilical cord blood progenitor cells in vitro. Furthermore, transplantation of hiPSC-EPO cells into mice with CKD induced by adenine treatment improved renal anemia. Thus, hiPSC-EPO cells may be a useful tool for clarifying the mechanisms of EPO production and may be useful as a therapeutic strategy for treating renal anemia.","2017","Science translational medicine",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Eser B. et al.","BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is a phosphorus-regulating hormone. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), circulating FGF-23 levels are markedly elevated and independently associated with mortality. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a potent risk factor for mortality in CKD, and FGFs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial hypertrophy. In addition, the effect of anemia on CV disease and LVH is well known in CKD. A relation between iron and FGF-23 metabolism is mentioned in a few studies. The aim of this study was to test the association of FGF-23 levels with echocardiographic (ECHO) and iron parameters in peritoneal dialysis patients (PD). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 61 subjects with PD (29 women and 32 men, mean age: 46.9±13.3 years, mean PD vintage: 69.5±39 months) underwent echocardiograms to assess left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Medical treatments and average values of the basic laboratory results of the last 6 months for all patients were recorded. Serum FGF-23 concentrations were measured using intact FGF-23 (iFGF-23) human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELİSA) kit. According to the median levels of serum FGF-23 the patients were grouped into two (FGF-23 high and low groups). RESULTS: Significant positive correlation was recorded between serum FGF-23 levels and LVMI (P=0.023). There was also significant difference in terms of hemoglobin (12.1±2 versus 11.0±2, P=0.017), transferrin saturation (TSAT) (24.9±16.8 versus 19.5±10.8, P=0.042) between low and high FGF-23 group. Also in linear regression analysis the negative relation between FGF-23 and hemoglobin is persisted (r=0.199, P=0.045).

,"31170159"," Iron deficiency, elevated erythropoietin, fibroblast growth factor 23, and mortality in the general population of the Netherlands: A cohort study. ","Eisenga M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Emerging data in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients suggest that iron deficiency and higher circulating levels of erythropoietin (EPO) stimulate the expression and concomitant cleavage of the osteocyte-derived, phosphate-regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a risk factor for premature mortality. To date, clinical implications of iron deficiency and high EPO levels in the general population, and the potential downstream role of FGF23, are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine the associations between iron deficiency and higher EPO levels with mortality, and the potential mediating role of FGF23, in a cohort of community-dwelling subjects. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed 6,544 community-dwelling subjects (age 53 ± 12 years; 50% males) who participated in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study-a prospective population-based cohort study, of which we used the second survey (2001-2003)-and follow-up was performed for a median of 8 years. We measured circulating parameters of iron status, EPO levels, and plasma total FGF23 levels. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. In multivariable linear regression analyses, ferritin (ß = -0.43), transferrin saturation (TSAT) (ß = -0.17), hepcidin (ß = -0.36), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR; ß = 0.33), and EPO (ß = 0.28) were associated with FGF23 level, independent of potential confounders. During median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up of 8.2 (7.7-8.8) years, 379 (6%) subjects died. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, lower levels of TSAT (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 standard deviation [SD], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.95; P = 0.004) and higher levels of sTfR (HR, 1.15; 95% CI 1.03-1.28; P = 0.01), EPO (HR, 1.17; 95% CI 1.05-1.29; P = 0.004), and FGF23 (HR, 1.20; 95% CI 1.10-1.32; P < 0.001) were each significantly associated with an increased risk of death, independent of potential confounders. Adjustment for FGF23 levels markedly attenuated the associations of TSAT (HR, 0.89; 95% CI 0.78-1.01; P = 0.06), sTfR (HR, 1.08; 95% CI 0.96-1.20; P = 0.19), and EPO (HR, 1.10; 95% CI 0.99-1.22; P = 0.08) with mortality. FGF23 remained associated with mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.27; P = 0.008) after adjustment for TSAT, sTfR, and EPO levels. Mediation analysis indicated that FGF23 explained 31% of the association between TSAT and mortality; similarly, FGF23 explained 32% of the association between sTfR and mortality and 48% of the association between EPO and mortality (indirect effect P < 0.05 for all analyses). The main limitations of this study were the observational study design and the absence of data on intact FGF23 (iFGF23), precluding us from discerning whether the current results are attributable to an increase in iFGF23 or in C-terminal FGF23 fragments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, we found that functional iron deficiency and higher EPO levels were each associated with an increased risk of death in the general population. Our findings suggest that FGF23 could be involved in the association between functional iron deficiency and increased EPO levels and death. Investigation of strategies aimed at correcting iron deficiency and reducing FGF23 levels is warranted.","2019","PLoS medicine"," Therefore , we aimed to determine the associations between iron deficiency and higher EPO levels with mortality , and the potential mediating role of FGF23 , in a cohort of community-dwelling subjects ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Beach L. et al.","BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are commonly used for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients often lack an understanding of the potential risks and benefits of ESAs, despite government mandated education on this topic. Decision aids are tools commonly used to discuss important information in health care settings. To address this knowledge gap, we designed this study to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ESA decision aid at promoting informed shared decision making (ISDM) between patients and providers related to ESA use for CKD- and ESRD-related anemia. METHODS: Using the principles of informed shared decision making theory, we designed and piloted an ESA decision aid intended to increase CKD and ESRD patient understanding of the potential risks and benefits of ESAs. Informed by the findings during development, the ESA decision aid was modified and finalized for testing. We will perform a randomized clinical trial to assess if administration of the ESA decision aid improves patient understanding of the risks and benefits of ESA use compared to control patients receiving standard care. Participants with either CKD or ESRD and who are receiving ESAs will be eligible for participation. The primary outcome is patients' score on the Patient Anemia Knowledge in Kidney Disease (PAKKD) survey assessed at enrollment and 3 months after. Secondary outcomes include decisional conflict related to ESAs, and patient satisfaction with provider communication. DISCUSSION: The Anemia Risk Communication for patients with Kidney Disease (ARC-KD) study will assess the effectiveness of a novel ESA decision aid to improve patient understanding of ESA use to manage CKD- and ESRD-related anemia. This decision aid is the first resource targeted to improve patient understanding of anemia management in the kidney health context. With the increasing options available for anemia management, this will serve as an important foundation to evolve in the future to optimize anemia-related shared decision making.

","Yamamoto H. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Molidustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that predominantly induces renal production of erythropoietin (EPO). Molidustat was evaluated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ""Molidustat Once Daily Improves Renal Anemia by Inducing EPO"" (MIYABI) program, which comprises 5 phase 3 clinical trials. The present MIYABI Non-Dialysis Correction (ND-C) study investigated the efficacy and safety of molidustat in Japanese patients with renal anemia who were not undergoing dialysis and were not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment. METHODS: This was a 52-week, randomized (1:1), open-label, active-control, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 study in Japanese patients with renal anemia associated with CKD (stages 3-5). Molidustat or the ESA darbepoetin alfa (hereinafter referred to as darbepoetin) were initiated at 25 mg once daily or 30 μg every 2 weeks, respectively, and doses were regularly titrated to correct and to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the target range of ≥11.0 g/dL and <13.0 g/dL. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean Hb level and its change from baseline during the evaluation period (weeks 30-36). The safety outcomes included evaluation of all adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 162 patients were randomized to receive molidustat (n = 82) or darbepoetin (n = 80). Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups. The mean (standard deviation) Hb levels at baseline were 9.84 (0.64) g/dL for molidustat and 10.00 (0.61) g/dL for darbepoetin. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) for mean Hb levels during the evaluation period for molidustat (11.28 [11.07, 11.50] g/dL) and darbepoetin (11.70 [11.50, 11.90] g/dL) was within the target range. Based on a noninferiority margin of 1.0 g/dL, molidustat was noninferior to darbepoetin in the change in mean Hb level during the evaluation period from baseline; the least-squares mean (95% CI) difference (molidustat-darbepoetin) was -0.38 (-0.67, -0.08) g/dL. The proportion of patients who reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 93.9% for molidustat and 93.7% for darbepoetin. Most TEAEs were mild (54.9% for molidustat and 63.3% for darbepoetin) or moderate (22.0% for molidustat and 22.8% for darbepoetin) in intensity. There were 3 deaths in the molidustat group and 1 in the darbepoetin group.

","Silverberg D.","Anemia is common in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and is associated with an increased mortality, morbidity and progressive renal failure. The most common causes of the anemia in CHF are (1) the associated Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes depression of erythropoietin (EPO) production in the kidney, and (2) excessive cytokine production in CHF, which can cause both depression of erythropoietin production in the kidney and depression of erythropoietin response in the bone marrow. The cytokines can also induce iron deficiency by increasing hepcidin production from the liver, which both reduces gastrointestinal iron absorption and reduces iron release from iron stores located in the macrophages and hepatocytes. It appears that iron deficiency is very common in CHF and is rarely recognized or treated. The iron deficiency can cause a thrombocytosis that might contribute to cardiovascular complications in both CHF and CKD and is reversible with iron treatment. Thus, attempts to control this anemia in CHF will have to take into consideration both the use of both Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) such as EPO and oral and, probably more importantly, intravenous (IV) iron. Many studies of anemia in CHF with ESA and oral or IV iron and even with IV iron without ESA have shown a positive effect on hospitalization, New York Heart Association functional class, cardiac and renal function, quality of life, exercise capacity and reduced Beta Natriuretic Peptide and have not demonstrated an increase in cardiovascular damage related to the therapy. However, adequately powered long-term placebo-controlled studies of ESA and of IV iron in CHF are still needed and are currently being carried out.","2011","Heart failure reviews",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Several randomized, controlled trials published from 1998 to 2009 examined normalization and near-normalization of hemoglobin in patients with both ESRD and CKD; they raised fundamental questions as to the safety of robust correction of anemia. These findings, taken together with subsequent actions of the FDA in ESA labeling and CMS's quality expectations for hemoglobin in payment for dialysis treatments, would result in a comprehensive reassessment of the hemoglobin targets in ESA therapy. A marked decrease in both national ESA utilization and hemoglobin attainment has ensued as a result. This discussion addresses the history of the striking changes in enthusiasm for hemoglobin-targeted anemia therapy from 1989 to the present, and similarly examines the evolution of ferritin-targeted iron administration, which has followed different-and markedly slower-historical development.","2017","Seminars in dialysis",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Ohki K. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) are used to treat renal anemia in patients with non-dialysis CKD, but this can lead to increases in blood pressure (BP). OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) and darbepoetin alfa (DA) on office/ambulatory BP in 36 patients with non-dialysis CKD and renal anemia who did not receive ESA treatment. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to CERA or DA, and received ESA treatment for 24 weeks. ESA doses were adjusted to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) at 10-12 g/dL. Primary outcomes were office/ambulatory BP after 24 weeks of ESA treatment. Hb levels were within the target range at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Office/ambulatory BP, renal function, and other parameters were not significantly different between groups. However, we could not exclude the possibility that differences may exist because our sample size was small. Therefore, we also performed analysis of all of the data that were compiled from the groups of per-protocol population. Although office/ambulatory BP profiles had not worsened after 24 weeks of ESA treatment, more than half of the patients required an increase in the antihypertensive agent dose. CONCLUSIONS: CERA and DA may have similar effects on BP profiles in patients with non-dialysis CKD and renal anemia. ESA treatment often requires increases in the doses of antihypertensive agents.","2020","Kidney diseases (Basel, Switzerland)"," OBJECTIVE : We investigated the effects of continuous erythropoietin receptor activator ( CERA ) and darbepoetin alfa ( DA ) on office / ambulatory BP in 36 patients with non-dialysis CKD and renal anemia who did not receive ESA treatment ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Ushio Y. et al.","BACKGROUND: Though anemia is a sign of poor renal prognosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD), hemoglobin (Hb) levels are typically higher in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) than in other kidney diseases, and anemia has not been examined as a potential prognosticator. Thus, we investigated anemia as a factor for renal prognosis in ADPKD. METHODS: In total, 115 non-dialysis patients, 48 men and 67 women, with ADPKD were evaluated. The renal outcome of a 50% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate or renal replacement therapy was examined using the Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a median of 5.5 years and 50 patients had reached the end point. The mean age of the patients at the first visit was 45.9 ± 13.3 years. The overall mean Hb was 12.90 ± 1.85 g/dL, and the mean Hb in men and women was 13.82 ± 1.72 g/dL and 12.25 ± 1.65 g/dL, respectively. Hb levels and uric protein content were statistically significant factors for poor renal prognosis, while hypertension and genetic mutations failed to reach significance. Furthermore, statistical significance was found in men with Hb < 12 g/dL and in women with Hb < 11 g/dL. Anemia had significant association with kidney disease progression in patients with ADPKD. CONCLUSIONS: We found that anemia might be a factor for poor renal prognosis in ADPKD. Furthermore, a sex difference was found, wherein men with Hb < 12 g/dL and women with Hb < 11 g/dL were at risk of renal disease progression.","2020","Clinical and experimental nephrology"," Thus , we investigated anemia as a factor for renal prognosis in ADPKD ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Zarzecki M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with the reduction of haemoglobin concentration and a variety of biochemical abnormalities including changes in serum concentration of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and hydrogen ions. However, data concerning epidemiology of these abnormalities are rare and incomplete, especially among subjects with mild to moderate CKD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a serum creatinine concentration > 110 micromol/l hospitalized in the Department of Nephrology, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases Medical University of Silesia from 1998 to 2002 were analyzed. Patients with acute renal failure or chronic renal failure treated with renal replacement therapy were excluded from this study. A total of 653 patients (262F and 391M) were divided into 9 subgroups differing from each other by progressive decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in haemoglobin concentration and increase in the prevalence of anaemia were found in patients with GFR < 50 ml/min. In a large number of patients with a GFR < 80 but > 50 ml/min, Hb concentration <11 g/dl was observed. Mean MCV, MCH and serum iron concentration were similar in all studied subgroups. A progressive increase in serum phosphorus concentration and decrease of calcaemia was found in patients with GFR < 30 ml/min. The elevated Ca x P product (> 4.44 mmol2/12) was noticed almost exclusively in patients with GFR< 30 ml/min. A decompensated metabolic acidosis was observed in 29.8% of patients with GFR <30 ml/min.

","Lee Y. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia and decreased kidney function are recognized as risk factors for morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The role of hemoglobin in renal function changes among elderly patients is not fully understood. METHODS: Of 1,500 people screened, 121 normotensive non-diabetic elderly patients were recruited, and underwent biochemistry examinations at the baseline, second and fourth years of a 4-year longitudinal study. Serum creatinine and calculated renal parameters, including the Cockroft-Gault (CG) formula, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study and abbreviated MDRD (abMDRD) equations were used to evaluate renal function and progression of kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariate regression analyses were used to explore predictors for decline in renal parameters. RESULTS: Ages ranged from 60 to 81 year (mean: 71.8+/-3.8). Baseline hemoglobin concentrations ranged from 11.9 to 17.3 g/dl (mean: 14.1+/-1.1). Serum creatinine increased and CG creatinine clearance (CrCl), MDRD and abMDRD GFR decreased during follow-up (all p< or =0.001). The prevalence of CKD significantly increased only in those with baseline hemoglobin concentrations of <14 g/dl (p< or =0.03, based on findings of both MDRD and abMDRD GFR). Baseline hemoglobin correlates with 4-year changes of MDRD and abMDRD GFR in univariate (both p<0.001) and multivariate regression analyses (both p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study revealed that the aging process was associated with decline of renal function in the elderly. Because hemoglobin concentrations are an independent predictor for subsequent decline in kidney function, it should be considered in the assessment of renal disease and GFR in the elderly.","2008","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Alsultan M. et al.","Hyperphosphatemia and anemia were both associated with several complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This study aimed to determine the risk factors of hyperphosphatemia and its relation with anemia among hemodialysis (HD) patients. Secondly, it aimed to determine the prevalence of hyperphosphatemia and anemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 146 HD patients from two HD centers in Syria, between June 2021 and March 2022. All patients at least 18 years old on maintenance HD were enrolled. The threshold of phosphorus (phos) level was divided by the upper normal range among HD patients (5.5 mg/dl). We used parametric and nonparametric statistics, the Pearson and Spearman correlations with simple and multiple linear regressions between study variables. RESULTS: 36.9% of patients had a serum phos level of 5.5 or less (norm phos group), and 63.1% of patients had a serum phos level higher than 5.5 (high phos group). Also, 60.9% of patients had hemoglobin (Hb) less than 10 g/dl, and 40.4% of patients had Hb at least 10 g/dl. Age, type of HD access, phos binders (P-binders), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium (Ca) showed significant effects on phos levels. Most patients were using arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (89.7%) as a HD access, and the meantime on HD was higher in the norm phos group compared to the high phos group. In a multivariate and univariate logistic regression analysis, hyperphosphatemia increased with increasing urea (Ur) and creatinine (Cr) levels, while the odds declined with increasing time on HD. Hb did not show a significant relation with phos by using several statistical methods. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of hyperphosphatemia and anemia was encountered among this sample of HD patients from Syria. There was no correlation between phos and Hb levels in contrast to previous conflicting studies, which mandates future studies to evaluate this correlation and further efforts to determine the range of phos that could have a benefit on anemia with respect to other comorbidities.","2023","Annals of medicine and surgery (2012)"," This study aimed to determine the risk factors of hyperphosphatemia and its relation with anemia among hemodialysis ( HD ) patients ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Suliman M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is an autosomal recessive haemoglobinopathy with high morbidity and mortality. Global survival of sickle patients is increased due to advances in management; and subsequently, prevalence of chronic complications including renal manifestations also increased. Therefore, early detection and management of these complications is mandatory. This study aimed to investigate the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), proteinuria and serum uric acid as markers of renal involvement in Sudanese sickle adults and association between these parameters and clinical severity score of sickle cell disease. METHODS: Cross-sectional hospital-based study included thirty-two adult Sudanese patients diagnosed with SCA and twenty-three as controls. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Blood and urine samples were collected. Severity score was calculated using Bios online calculator and eGFR was calculated using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula without adjustment for ethnicity. Associations between the severity score and renal parameters were tested using unpaired T test and Mann Whitney test for normally and non-normally distributed data and correlations between variables were tested using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: Protein/Creatinine Ratio (PCR) was significantly higher (p-value < 0.001) in sickle cell anaemia group compared to controls. Hyper-filtration and Hyperuricemia were manifested in 75% and 6.3% of SCA group respectively. There was no association between the severity score and renal manifestations in the SCA group.

","Otaki Y. et al.","BACKGROUND: Cardio-renal anemia syndrome (CRAS) has begun to gather attention as a vicious circle since chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and anemia are all able to be caused and exacerbated by each other. However, it remains unclear whether renal tubular damage (RTD), another type of kidney dysfunction, is associated with this vicious circle. The aim of the present study was to assess the association of RTD with CRAS in patients with CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 300 consecutive patients with CHF. RTD was defined as a urinary β2-microglobulin to creatinine ratio ≥ 300 μg/g. Patients with RTD had lower serum iron and higher levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein than those without it. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that RTD was closely associated with anemia in patients with CHF, after adjustment for confounding factors. During a median period of 1,098 days, there were 86 cardiac events, including 14 cardiac deaths and 72 re-hospitalizations for worsening heart failure. Net reclassification improvement was significantly improved by addition of RTD to the model including age, New York Heart Association functional class, brain natriuretic peptide, anemia, and CKD. All patients were divided into 3 groups: CRAS+RTD group, CRAS group, and control group. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that CRAS+RTD had the greatest risk in patients with CHF.

Abnormally elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D cause osteocytes to secrete FGF23, which subsequently induces phosphaturia. Recent studies have reported that iron deficiency, erythropoietin (EPO) and hypoxia regulate the pathways responsible for FGF23 production. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between FGF23 and anemia-related factors are not yet fully understood. The present review discusses the associations between FGF23, iron, EPO and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), and their impact on FGF23 bioactivity, focusing on recent studies. Collectively, these findings propose interactions between FGF23 gene expression and anemia-related factors, including iron deficiency, EPO and HIFs.

SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: Prospective studies measuring energy or physical function with both baseline and follow-up measurement. INTERVENTION: ESA treatment. OUTCOMES: Improvements in energy and physical function assessed using effect size, a measure of treatment responsiveness. RESULTS: 14 studies were identified: 11 measured energy and 14 measured physical function.

However, few studies have investigated elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 as a risk factor for the development of anemia in patients with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 3869 individuals with mild to severe CKD enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study between 2003 and 2008 and followed through 2013. We hypothesized that elevated baseline fibroblast growth factor 23 levels are associated with prevalent anemia, decline in hemoglobin over time, and development of incident anemia, defined as serum hemoglobin level <13 g/dl in men, serum hemoglobin level <12 g/dl in women, or use of erythropoietin stimulating agents. RESULTS: In the 1872 of 3869 individuals who had prevalent anemia at baseline, mean age was 58 (11) years old, and mean eGFR was 39 (13) ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Higher levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 were significantly associated with prevalent anemia (odds ratio per 1-SD increase in natural log-transformed fibroblast growth factor 23, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.26 to 1.52), decline in hemoglobin over 4 years, and risk of incident anemia (hazard ratio per 1-SD increase in natural log-transformed fibroblast growth factor 23, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.24; quartile 4 versus quartile 1: hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.11) independent of demographic characteristics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, CKD-specific factors, and other mineral metabolism markers.

This review addresses this and other recent studies of ESA treatment for renal anemia to higher hemoglobin (Hgb) targets above the range of 10-12 g/dl. RECENT FINDINGS: TREAT and other recent large randomized, controlled trials of ESA treatment in patients with CKD have not demonstrated a clinical benefit in terms of mortality, morbidity, or quality of life improvement of targeting Hgb levels greater than 12-13 g/dl. Some of these studies have demonstrated increased risk of stroke, vascular access thrombosis, hypertension, and other events. These findings are generally consistent with those of an earlier study of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. SUMMARY: ESA treatment for renal anemia should be aimed at reducing transfusion risk, with a treatment target in most patients of 10-12 g/dl; therapy should be individualized, rapid increases in Hgb level should probably be avoided, and lowest appropriate ESA doses should be used.

RESULTS: Among 597,968 patients initiating dialysis in the United States in 2005 through 2017, those in cities with detectable lead levels in community water had significantly lower pre-ESKD hemoglobin concentrations and more ESA use per 0.01 mg/L increase in 90(th) percentile water lead. Findings were similar for the 208,912 patients with data from the first month of ESKD therapy, with lower hemoglobin and higher ESA use per 0.01 mg/L higher lead concentration. These associations were observed at lead levels below the EPA threshold (0.015 mg/L) that mandates regulatory action. We also observed environmental inequities, finding significantly higher water lead levels and slower declines over time among Black versus White patients.

Following the findings of the TREAT study, the Anaemia Working Group of ERBP maintains its view that 'Hb values of 11-12 g/dL should be generally sought in the CKD population without intentionally exceeding 13 g/dL' and that the doses of ESA therapy to achieve the target haemoglobin should also be considered. More caution is suggested when treating anaemia with ESA therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes not undergoing dialysis (and probably in diabetics at all CKD stages).

Mortality risks associated with CKD among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are not well defined. Anemia is associated with increased mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and may also increase risk among patients with CVD. METHODS: A random sample of patients admitted to the hospital in a single southern state with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (ICD-9 codes 410.xx) were followed up after hospital discharge. RESULTS: CKD was found in 60% of the cohort. Hematocrit of >or=40 was found in 46% of the patients; 26.0% had a hematocrit between 36% and 39%, 21.8% between 30% and 35%, and 5.9% had a hematocrit of less than 30%. The 1-year death rates among individuals with and without CKD were 31.7% and 10.4% respectively [odds ratio (OR) = 4.00 (2.34, 6.91)]. The mortality at one year was 18.6% for individuals with a hematocrit greater than or equal to 40%; 23.5% (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.78, 2.32) for hematocrit 36% to 39%; 30.7% (OR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.12, 3.34) for hematocrit between 30% and 35%; and 35.8% (OR = 3.16; 95% CI = 1.35, 7.40) for those with a hematocrit less than 30% (chi2 for trend was 12.2, P = 0.007). Both hematocrit and serum creatinine were independently associated with increased risk of death during follow-up after controlling for other patient risk factors.

","Noonan M. et al.","Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is a critical factor in chronic kidney disease (CKD), with elevated levels causing alterations in mineral metabolism and increased odds for mortality. Patients with CKD develop anemia as the kidneys progressively lose the ability to produce erythropoietin (EPO). Anemia is a potent driver of FGF23 secretion; therefore, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) currently in clinical trials to elevate endogenous EPO to resolve anemia was tested for effects on iron utilization and FGF23-related parameters in a CKD mouse model. Mice were fed either a casein control diet or an adenine-containing diet to induce CKD. The CKD mice had markedly elevated iFGF23 and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hyperphosphatemia, and anemia. Cohorts of mice were then treated with a patient-equivalent dose of BAY 85-3934 (BAY; Molidustat), which elevated EPO and completely resolved aberrant complete blood counts (CBCs) in the CKD mice. iFGF23 was elevated in vehicle-treated CKD mice (120-fold), whereas circulating iFGF23 was significantly attenuated (>60%) in the BAY-treated CKD mice. The BAY-treated mice with CKD also had reduced BUN, but there was no effect on renal vitamin D metabolic enzyme expression. Consistent with increased EPO, bone marrow Erfe, Transferrin receptor (Tfrc), and EpoR mRNAs were increased in BAY-treated CKD mice, and in vitro hypoxic marrow cultures increased FGF23 with direct EPO treatment. Liver Bmp-6 and hepcidin expression were downregulated in all BAY-treated groups. Femur trabecular parameters and cortical porosity were not worsened with BAY administration. In vitro, differentiated osteocyte-like cells exposed to an iron chelator to simulate iron depletion/hypoxia increased FGF23; repletion with holo-transferrin completely suppressed FGF23 and normalized Tfrc1. Collectively, these results support that resolving anemia using a HIF-PHI during CKD was associated with lower BUN and reduced FGF23, potentially through direct restoration of iron utilization, thus providing modifiable outcomes beyond improving anemia for this patient population. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).","2021","Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: Based on the data from routine health checkups in tertiary university hospitals during the last 15 years, 145 865 adult subjects were identified. RESULTS: Hemoglobin levels among eGFR Groups 2-6 (50 ≤ eGFR < 100 mL/min/1.73m(2)) were significantly higher compared to eGFR group ≥100 mL/min/1.73m(2) (P < 0.001), and the highest level of mean hemoglobin was seen at eGFR 50-59 mL/min/1.73m(2).

Electrocardiography (ECG) is a noninvasive test of cardiac activity that has been determined to be related to DM and its complications.

METHODS: there were 104,823 ECGs with corresponding HbA1c or fasting glucose which were utilized to train a DLM for calculating ECG-HbA1c. Next, 1539 cases from outpatient departments and health examination centers provided 2190 ECGs for initial validation, and another 3293 cases with their first ECGs were employed to analyze its contributions to DM management. The primary analysis was used to distinguish patients with and without mild to severe DM, and the secondary analysis was to explore the predictive value of ECG-HbA1c for future complications, which included all-cause mortality, new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD), and new-onset heart failure (HF). RESULTS: we used a gender/age-matching strategy to train a DLM to achieve the best AUCs of 0.8255 with a sensitivity of 71.9% and specificity of 77.7% in a follow-up cohort with correlation of 0.496 and mean absolute errors of 1.230. The stratified analysis shows that DM presented in patients with fewer comorbidities was significantly more likely to be detected by ECG-HbA1c. Patients with higher ECG-HbA1c under the same Lab-HbA1c exhibited worse physical conditions. Of interest, ECG-HbA1c may contribute to the mortality (gender/age adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.53, 95% conference interval (CI): 1.08-2.17), new-onset CKD (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.30-1.87), and new-onset HF (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.13-2.01) independently of Lab-HbA1c.

Study design and sample size calculations were based on previously published Canadian data. METHODS: One hundred seventy-two patients were randomly assigned. The treatment group received therapy with erythropoietin alfa subcutaneously to maintain or achieve hemoglobin (Hgb) level targets of 12.0 to 14.0 g/dL (120 to 140 g/L). The control/delayed treatment group had Hgb levels of 9.0 +/- 0.5 g/dL (90 +/- 5 g/L) before therapy was started: target level was 9.0 to 10.5 g/dL (90 to 105 g/L). Optimal blood pressure and parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate level targets were prescribed; all patients were iron replete. The primary end point is LV growth at 24 months. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients were eligible for the intention-to-treat analysis: mean age was 57 years, 30% were women, 38% had diabetes, and median glomerular filtration rate was 29 mL/min (0.48 mL/s; range, 12 to 55 mL/min [0.20 to 0.92 mL/s]). Blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use were similar in the control/delayed treatment and treatment groups at baseline. Erythropoietin therapy was administered to 77 of 78 patients in the treatment group, with a median final dose of 2,000 IU/wk. Sixteen patients in the control/delayed treatment group were administered erythropoietin at a median final dose of 3,000 IU/wk. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of mean change in LV mass index (LVMI) from baseline to 24 months, which was 5.21 +/- 30.3 g/m2 in the control/delayed treatment group versus 0.37 +/- 25.0 g/m2 in the treatment group. Absolute mean difference between groups was 4.85 g/m2 (95% confidence interval, -4.0 to 13.7; P = 0.28). Mean Hgb level was greater in the treatment group throughout the study and at study end was 12.75 g/dL (127.5 g/L in treatment group versus 11.46 g/dL [114.6 g/L] in control/delayed treatment group; P = 0.0001). LV growth occurred in 20.1% in the treatment group versus 31% in the control/delayed treatment group (P = 0.136).

CONCLUSION: This trial describes disparity between observational and randomized controlled trial data: observed and randomly assigned Hgb level and LVMI are not linked; thus, there is strong evidence that the association between Hgb level and LVMI likely is not causal.

METHODS: Originally, 81 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients not on dialysis and naïve to erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) were randomly assigned into two open-label groups (3 : 1). As a majority of control group patients opted out of control status, this study reports on the single arm study analysis that was performed on the 48 patients who received the drug through week 16. Sixty-two patients received once-weekly darbepoetin alfa in addition to conservative management for CKD. Instruments that measured general (SF-36, FACTanemia, FACT-fatigue, ADL and IADL) and disease specific (KDQOL) HRQOL domains were administered at baseline and after 8, 16, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: Compared to baseline values, mean HRQOL subscales were significantly improved in the treatment group at 16 weeks (p < 0.05 for SF-36 physical function; p < 0.001 for SF-36 vitality, FACT anemia and FACT fatigue scales). At week 16, the SF-36 mean increase for 48 treatment patients in the Vitality Subscale Score was 14.9 (SD 3.2) and the mean increase in the KDQOL Burden of Kidney Disease Subscale was 5.5 (SD 3.3). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant association (p < 0.05) between hemoglobin levels and higher HRQOL scores on several physical function, energy and fatigue scales. CONCLUSION: Improvements in hemoglobin in CKD patients not on dialysis were associated with statistically significant (p < 0.05), clinically meaningful (> 5 points) HRQOL improvements on scales measuring physical activity, vitality and fatigue. Our study did not show an association between increased hemoglobin levels and other aspects of HRQOL, such as those relating to emotional status, sexual activity or cognition. The interpretation of our results is limited by the lack of a control arm to assess whether conservative therapy for CKD, in the absence of ESA administration, would have a comparable effect on patients' HRQOL scores. Further research needs to examine whether other aspects of HRQOL improve with anemia treatment, in the same way as those aspects of HRQOL more closely related to physical activity and fatigue.","2007","Current medical research and opinion"," OBJECTIVE : This was an open-label study to asses the association of changes in hemoglobin with changes in health related quality of life ( HRQOL ) in patients treated with darbepoetin alfa ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: DKD anemia patients treated with either Roxadustat or erythropoietin (EPO) for 3 months in two hospitals were enrolled. EPO group were matched 1:1 to Roxadustat group based on age, gender and baseline Hb. Baseline data include age, sex, dialysis, height, weight, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), serum albumin (ALB), serum creatinine (Scr), eGFR, C-reactive protein (CRP), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Primary and secondary outcomes were change of Hb (ΔHb) and Hct (ΔHct), Hb response rate and Hb qualified rate. Sensitivity analyses were performed and the effect size were calculated. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in body mass index (BMI), Scr, eGFR, Hct, CRP, and dialysis between the 2 groups (61 subjects each). ALB, iPTH, and DKD stage differed between the 2 groups. After 3-month treatment, Roxadustat significantly increased patients' Hb and Hct. Although ΔHb and ΔHct of the Roxadustat group was higher than those of EPO group, difference in the least-square mean changes (95% CI) were 4.9 (-2.4, 12.1) and 1.2 (-1.1, 3.4), while Cohen's d were 0.18 and 0.14, suggesting that Roxadustat's ability to increase Hb within 3-month was similar to EPO. 78.7% and 54.1% of the patients responded to anti-anemia therapy in the Roxadustat and EPO group, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed the Hb response rate of Roxadustat was 3.30 (1.20, 9.94) times higher than that of EPO. Subgroup analysis suggested that Roxadustat might have better efficacy in treating patients in the advanced stage, with high CRP and iPTH, and low ALB levels.

At the turn of the century, darbepoetin alfa, a hyperglycosylated form, became available for clinical use. It conferred greater metabolic stability in vivo owing to two additional N-linked carbohydrate chains attached to the protein backbone and has a half-life 3 times longer than that of epoetin.

AREAS COVERED: Factors considered to be associated with the development of anemia in COPD have included: Aging and kidney dysfunction with erythropoietin deficiency and bone marrow suppression due to uremic toxins; heart failure (HF), often encountered in COPD and accompanied by anemia in one-third of the cases; Low-grade chronic inflammation, directly suppressing bone marrow and diminishing iron absorption and utilization via increased hepcidin levels; long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), ameliorating chronic hypoxia, and most important, RAS inhibitors, which are widely used for the comorbidities associated with COPD (hypertension, HF, CKD, diabetes) and have previously been shown to lower hematocrit values or cause anemia in various clinical conditions. EXPERT OPINION: Introduction of LTOT in COPD and especially the established use of RAS inhibitors form the basis for the shift from polycythemia to anemia in COPD. Interestingly, when the SGLT2 inhibitors are introduced for cardiorenal protection in COPD, one could anticipate correction of anemia or even reemergence of polycythemia, since this new class of drugs can augment erythropoietin secretion and increase hematocrit values.","2022","Expert review of respiratory medicine",,"Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

After 24-week surgery, CKD rats exhibited normocytic normochromic anemia and normal serum erythropoietin levels despite of anemia. Serum iron levels were decreased in CKD rats compared with the controls. Of interest, intestinal expression of critical iron importers, such as duodenal cytochrome b (Dcyt-b) and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT-1), was decreased in CKD rats compared with the controls. On the other hand, intestinal expression of ferroportin, an intestinal iron exporter, was not different in the control and CKD groups. Moreover, hepatic expression of hepcidin, a regulator of iron homeostasis, did not differ between the control and CKD groups. These results suggest that impaired intestinal expression of Dcyt-b and DMT-1 might be associated with the reduction of an iron uptake in CKD. Taken together, impaired these intestinal iron transporters may become a novel therapeutic target for cardio-renal anemia syndrome.","2017","Heart and vessels"," In this study , we assessed intestinal iron transporters in CKD model rats to investigate the association of intestinal iron transporters in the mechanism of cardio-renal anemia syndrome ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Desai A. et al.","BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as in other populations, elevations in cardiac biomarker levels predict increased risk of cardiovascular events. We examined the value of troponin T (TnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) in assessing the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetic patients with CKD. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study nested within a randomized clinical trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 20-60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and anemia enrolled in TREAT (Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy). PREDICTORS: Serum levels of the cardiac biomarkers TnT and NT-pro-BNP. OUTCOMES: Incidence of ESRD and the composite of death or ESRD. MEASUREMENTS: We measured TnT and NT-pro-BNP in baseline serum samples from the first 1,000 patients enrolled in TREAT. The relationship of these cardiac biomarker levels to the development of ESRD and death or ESRD was analyzed in multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Detectable TnT (≥0.01 ng/mL) was present in 45% of participants, and median NT-pro-BNP level was elevated at 605 pg/mL. Higher levels of both cardiac biomarkers were associated independently with higher rates of ESRD, as well as death or ESRD, and remained prognostically important after adjustment for eGFR, proteinuria, and other known predictors of CKD progression. The addition of cardiac biomarkers to a multivariable model for prediction of ESRD improved discrimination of those with and without an event by 16.9% (95% CI, 6.3%-27.4%). LIMITATIONS: Observational study in a clinical trial cohort; results require validation. CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes, anemia, and CKD, TnT and NT-pro-BNP levels frequently are elevated. These cardiac-derived biomarkers enhance prediction of ESRD beyond established risk factors. Measurement of TnT and NT-pro-BNP may improve the identification of patients with CKD who are likely to require renal replacement therapy, supporting a link between cardiac injury and the development of ESRD.","2011","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

This prospective cohort study included patients with end-stage renal disease currently undergoing hemodialysis. The initial 6-month clinical evaluation provided data of the variability in hemoglobin, associated blood parameters, and the use of erythropoietin. Subsequently, the patients were followed up for 78 months to evaluate mortality-associated factors. In total, 133 patients completed the 6-month follow-up with a mean age of 47.1 (±13.2) years. The majority were women (51.9%). Six-month hemoglobin levels were as follows: always low (18.0%), intermediate/target (1.5%), always high (0.8%), low-amplitude fluctuation/Hb low (n = 37; 27.8%), low-amplitude fluctuation/Hb high (13.53%), and high-amplitude fluctuation (38.6%), among end-stage renal disease patients. At the end of 78 months, 50 (37.6%) patients died; 70% of deaths were attributed to cardiovascular etiologies. A high variability was observed in hemoglobin levels, which was not associated with mortality. Among all the variables evaluated, age, erythropoietin dose, and transferrin saturation were associated with a higher mortality. Thus, this study suggests that greater attention to erythropoietin doses and transferrin saturation levels may improve the survival of dialysis patients.","2021","International journal of environmental research and public health",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Aydin Z. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Hepcidin, a small peptide hormone synthesized in the liver, plays central role in regulation of iron metabolism. Hepcidin generation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is dependent on iron status, anemia, inflammation, and hypoxia and erythropoietin levels. In our study, the relationship between Prohepcidin levels and inflammation and iron indices in non-diabetic uremic patients was investigated. METHODS: This study has a cross-sectional design which includes four groups: Non-diabetic 21 patients with stage 4 CKD (predialysis), 20 hemodialysis (HD) and 21 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and 17 healthy volunteers as the control group. Complete blood count, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, parathyroid hormone, interleukin (IL)-6 and Prohepcidin levels were recorded. RESULTS: Serum Prohepcidin levels in the predialysis, HD, PD and the control groups were 119.6 ± 45.1 ng/mL, 140.2 ± 41.8 ng/mL, 148.2 ± 35.0 ng/mL and 93.8 ± 21.9 ng/mL, respectively (p < 0.001). Prohepcidin was positively correlated with urea (r = 0.345, p = 0.002), creatinine (r = 0.465, p < 0.001), phosphorus (r = 0.253, p = 0.025), hsCRP (r = 0.275, p = 0.019), duration of dialysis treatment (r = 0.443, p < 0.001), fibrinogen (r = 0.467, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (r = 0.615, p < 0.001) levels. A negative correlation was detected between Prohepcidin levels and albumin (r = -0.286, p < 0.001), TIBC (r = -0.573, p < 0.001), GFR (r = -0.473, p < 0.001), hemoglobin (r = -0.351, p = 0.002) and hematocrit (r = -0.342, p = 0.002) levels. DISCUSSION: Prohepcidin levels increase with deepening anemia and show positive correlation with inflammatory markers. Therapeutic interventions regarding Prohepcidin action on inflammatory status may play a role in the treatment of anemia due to inflammation. Functional iron deficiency is frequent in uremic patients. It may be beneficial to measure Prohepcidin level together with ferritin among these patients.","2014","Renal failure",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Xu Y. et al.","RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: To characterize associations between long-term visit-to-visit variability of hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and risk of adverse kidney outcomes in patients with diabetes. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 93,598 adults with diabetes undergoing routine care in Stockholm, Sweden. EXPOSURES AND PREDICTORS: Categories of baseline and time-varying HbA(1c) variability score (HVS, the percentage of total HbA(1c) measures that vary by>0.5% [5.5mmol/mol] during a 3-year window): 0-20%, 21%-40%, 41%-60%, 61%-80%, and 81%-100%, with 0-20% as the reference group. OUTCOME: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression (composite of>50% estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] decline and kidney failure), acute kidney disease (AKI by clinical diagnosis or transient creatinine elevations according to KDIGO criteria), and worsening of albuminuria. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Compared with persons showing low HbA(1c) variability (HVS 0-20%), any increase in variability was associated with a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes beyond mean HbA(1c). For example, for patients with a baseline HbA(1c) variability of 81%-100%, the adjusted HR was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.47-1.74) for CKD progression, 1.23 [1.16-1.3] for AKI, and 1.28 [1.21-1.36] for worsening of albuminuria. The results were consistent across subgroups (diabetes subtypes, baseline eGFR, or albuminuria categories), in time-varying analyses and in sensitivity analyses including time-weighted average HbA(1c) or alternative metrics of variability. LIMITATIONS: Observational study, limitations of claims data, lack of information on diet, body mass index, medication changes, and diabetes duration. CONCLUSIONS: Higher long-term visit-to-visit HbA(1c) variability is consistently associated with the risks of CKD progression, AKI, and worsening of albuminuria. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: The evidence for current guideline recommendations derives from clinical trials that focus on a single HbA(1c) as the definitive measure of efficacy of an intervention. However, long-term visit-to-visit fluctuations of HbA(1c) may provide additional value in the prediction of future kidney complications. We evaluated the long-term fluctuations in glycemic control in almost 100,000 persons with diabetes undergoing routine care in Stockholm, Sweden. We observed that higher long-term HbA(1c) fluctuation is consistently associated with the risks of chronic kidney disease progression, worsening of albuminuria and acute kidney injury. This finding supports a role for long-term glycemic variability in the development of kidney complications and illustrates the potential usefulness of this metric for risk stratification at the bedside beyond a single HbA(1c) test.","2023","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation","RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE : To characterize associations between long-term visit-to-visit variability of hemoglobin A ( 1c ) ( HbA ( 1c ) ) and risk of adverse kidney outcomes in patients with diabetes ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: This cross-sectional, single-center study analyzed 162 non-dialysis iron and epoietin-naïve CKD patients (52% males, median age 67 years, eGFR 14.2 mL/min 1.73 m(2), hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL). BM aspiration, serum hepcidin (ELISA), ferritin, TSAT, and C-Reactive protein (CRP) were the main studied parameters. RESULTS: ACD was seen in 51%, IDA-ACD in 40%, while ""pure"" IDA in only 9%. In univariate and binomial analyses, IDA-ACD differed from ACD by lower ferritin and TSAT, but not by hepcidin or CRP. Correspondingly, in receiver operating curve analysis, ferritin and TSAT differentiated IDA-ACD from ACD, at cutoffs of 165 ng/mL and 14%, but with moderate precision (sensitivity and specificity of 72%, and 61%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The mixed pattern IDA-ACD could be more prevalent than estimated in non-dialysis CKD. Ferritin and, to a lesser degree, TSAT are useful in the diagnosis of IDA superimposed on ACD, while hepcidin, although reflecting BM macrophages iron, seems to have limited utility.","2023","Renal failure",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational, retrospective study included kidney transplant patients treated with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta according to investigators' clinical practice. Information about demographics, CKD, anemia, blood analyses, treatment, and adverse events were collected from patients' medical charts at baseline as well as months 1, 3, and 6. RESULTS: From October 2009 to March 2010, the 285 patients in the study included: an overall mean age of 52.8±13.9 years with 146 females (51.2%) and 152 patients (55.1%) in stage 3 CKD. Forty-five patients (15.8%) were in the immediate posttransplant period; 51, naïve- treatment (17.9%) and 189, converted subjects (66.3%). Eighty-two of the converted patients (48.0%) had previously received darbepoietin; 81 (47.4%), epoetin beta; and 8 (4.7%), epoetin alfa. The mean doses of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta at baseline were 75.0±22.4 μg per month, 95.8±45.5 μg per month, and 118.9±58.9 μg per month among naïve, converted, and immediate posttransplant patients, respectively. Mean hemoglobin content varied from baseline to month 6, namely 10.2±0.7 versus 11.8±0.9 g/dL in naïve (P<.001) and 11.4±1.3 versus 12.0±1.2 g/dL in converted patients (P=.001). Patients in the immediate posttransplant period showed mean hemoglobin values maintained between 10.4±1.7 g/dL at baseline and 11.5±1.2 g/dL at month 3. The only study-drug-related adverse event was hypertension. No patient died during the study. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggested that hemoglobin stability can be achieved and maintained after correction or conversion to once-monthly methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in kidney recipients.

For levels of 11.5-13 g/dl, there is no evidence of either harm or benefit compared with a lower Hb level. Quality of life studies are variable in quality but do suggest superior outcomes and functional status. In the 9 years following 1997, the target Hb level recommended by international guidelines tended to increase, especially for patients without accompanying cardiovascular disease. However, strangely enough, the most recent target level of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative is 11-12 g/dl, which is exactly the range advocated by the same group a decade earlier. The relative importance of quality of life compared with other outcomes, the use of iron, and the impact of venous thrombotic events continue to be debated.

Method This was a retrospective cohort study involving patients diagnosed with stage 5 CKD according to the Saudi Society of Nephrology and Transplantation conducted at eight tertiary care centers in the Tabuk region, Saudi Arabia. We compared the cost-effectiveness of long-acting erythropoietin with the short-acting one. The decision analysis model and Markov model were established to simulate a cohort of 55-year-old patients to estimate the incremental cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for chronic hemodialysis patients (CHP) treated with either darbepoetin-alfa or epoetin-beta for at least nine months. The incremental cost per QALY was the main outcome marker for using both medications. Serum HB levels were monitored on a monthly basis and costs were calculated. Results A total of 291 CHP met our inclusion criteria; 194 of them were treated with darbepoetin-alfa while 97 were treated with epoetin-beta. The mean age was 56.3 ± 11.2 years for the darbepoetin-alfa group and 55.2 ± 7.8 years for the epoetin-beta cohort. The baseline serum Hb was 10.68 ± 0.98 g/dL for darbepoetin-alfa patients and 11.63 ± 0.32 g/dL for the epoetin-beta group (p=0.003). We observed a significant difference between the percentage of patients successfully treated with epoetin-beta and those managed with darbepoetin-alfa (80.4% vs. 63.92%, p=0.01) with considerably less cardiovascular side effects. The average annual cost per patient was estimated at $919.47 and $12,319.41 for epoetin-beta and darbepoetin-alfa respectively. Also, the average effectiveness was 0.58 for darbepoetin-alfa vs. 0.61 for epoetin-beta. The average cost-effectiveness ratio was $980.25 and $15,023.66 with an incremental cost difference of -$966 in favor of epoetin-beta compared to darbepoetin-alfa.

The primary outcome was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope for two years. We performed multiple linear regression and restricted cubic spline analyses to assess the association of serum EPO levels with the renal outcome. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g creatinine.

Inappropriately low EPO levels were observed in 73% of anemic patients and 59% of anemic patients even without CKD, suggesting that EPO deficiency precedes the onset of CKD in diabetes mellitus. Multivariable analysis revealed that iron status and hemoglobin levels were major determinants of EPO levels. Median eGFR slope was -1.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year. We found that low EPO levels, but not low hemoglobin levels, were associated with a faster decline in eGFR, independent of clinically relevant factors. The eGFR decline was steeper, particularly when the EPO level was below the upper limit of normal. Lower EPO concentrations were associated with rapid eGFR decline, especially in patients with iron deficiency (P for interaction = 0.01). Relative EPO deficiency should be considered as a culprit in anemia of unknown etiology in diabetic patients, even those without CKD. Low EPO levels, especially when accompanied by poor iron status, are predictive of rapid loss of renal function.","2019","Scientific reports",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Kacarska-Fotevska I. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is present in about 50% in pre-dialysis and over 90% of patients on hemodialysis. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) is a standard therapy for renal anemia, but management of anemia in CKD still remains a challenge from the treatment point of view. AIM: To evaluate safety and efficacy of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta as continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.) in maintenance of haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in patients with chronic renal anemia in the routine clinical practice. METHODS: National, multicenter, observational, prospective study in patients with CKD on hemodialysis for maintenance of Hb levels with once-monthly therapy with C.E.R.A. In 8 dialysis centers 184 adult patients were observed and followed up every month during one year. Total number of enrolled patients was 185 from whom 184 patients were observed and 147 patients were followed for 12 months as 37 dropped out from the study earlier. RESULTS: Overall mean dose of C.E.R.A. was 115.2 μg with average 4.99 dose modifications per patient. Among 184 patients observed, total number of 121 adverse events (AEs) were identified in 49 of the patients. The most of the AEs were of mild or moderate severity. A few serious AEs were assessed and reported as not related to the drug administration. Mean Hb levels during the study varied but were maintained stable in the range of 100-120 g/l. CONCLUSION: Safety and tolerability of C.E.R.A. was as expected as the frequency and type of AEs was similar to the known pattern from the studies done in other countries and relevant literature.

","Yoshida T. and Hayashi M.","Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is treated by long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Although the results of previous studies have shown that hemoglobin levels could not be maintained at the initiation of dialysis in CKD patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin, it remains undetermined whether long-acting ESAs are effective in preventing the progression of anemia at the initiation of dialysis. In the present study, hemoglobin levels in 40 CKD patients treated with darbepoetin alfa (DA) and 15 CKD patients treated with a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) were retrospectively compared during the 6 months period before the initiation of dialysis. Results showed that DA and CERA both maintained hemoglobin levels at around 10 g/dL from 6 months to 1 month before dialysis. However, hemoglobin levels at the initiation of dialysis significantly decreased to 9.1 ± 1.2 g/dL in the DA group and to 9.0 ± 1.0 g/dL in the CERA group. Although the total doses of ESAs used during the 6-month period were similar between the two groups, DA-treated CKD patients received subcutaneous injections more frequently than did patients treated with CERA. These results suggest that CKD patients require more intense ESA therapy to prevent a decline in hemoglobin levels at the initiation of dialysis, including those treated with long-acting ESAs. The results also raise the possibility that CERA is more useful than DA for reducing the number of injections during the pre-dialysis period.","2017","The Keio journal of medicine",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

However, use of the phosphate binder ferric citrate (FC) increases body iron stores and hemoglobin levels in CKD patients. By intensifying oxidative stress and inflammation iron overload resulting from excessive use of intravenous iron can accelerate CKD progression. The present study explored the route of absorption and tissue distribution of iron with FC administration and its effect on renal function, histology, and inflammatory, oxidative, and fibrosis pathways in CKD rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to sham-operated control (CTL) group and 5/6 nephrectomized (CKD) groups fed either regular or 4% FC-supplemented diets for 6 weeks. Animals were then sacrificed, and blood and target tissues were harvested and processed. The untreated CKD rats exhibited anemia, hypertension, upregulation of renal tissue inflammatory, oxidative, and fibrotic pathways, impaired nuclear translocation, and downregulation of Nrf2's target gene products and depletion of colonic epithelial tight junction proteins. FC administration raised serum iron, improved anemia, attenuated hyperphosphatemia, partially improved renal function, reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, and restored colonic epithelial zonula occludens-1 protein abundance. Tissue iron staining detected presence of iron in epithelial cells and subepithelium of colon and in renal proximal tubules.

TRANSFORM was a multi-center, observational study designed to describe the time course of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration (primary outcome measure) and other parameters of clinical management of anemia in European hemodialysis patients in clinical practice before and after a switch from PEG-Epo to DA. METHODS: Eligible subjects were adult patients with CKD dialyzed at European dialysis centers for ≥26 weeks and treated with PEG-Epo for ≥14 weeks immediately prior to being switched to DA and no earlier than January 2011. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses and Hb values were recorded for the 14-week pre-switch and 26-week post-switch periods. RESULTS: Of the 1,027 eligible patients enrolled at 42 hemodialysis centers in 7 European countries, 785 were included in analyses. Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) Hb was generally stable: 11.19 (11.11, 11.26), 11.48 (11.40, 11.57), and 11.29 (11.20, 11.37) g/dL at month -1 pre-switch and months 3 and 6 post-switch, respectively. The geometric mean (95% CI) PEG-Epo dose at month -1 was 27.4 (26.0, 28.8) µg/week; DA dose was 29.4 (27.9, 30.9), 23.3 (21.9, 24.9), and 25.6 (24.1, 27.1) µg/week at months 1, 4, and 6, respectively. The geometric mean (95% CI) dose ratio at switching was 1.06 (1.01, 1.11). When stratifying by dose-ratio categories <0.8, 0.8-1.2, and >1.2 at switching, mean DA dose and Hb converged within narrow ranges by month 6 post-switch: 23.9-27.0 µg/week and 11.1-11.5 g/dL, respectively. Hb excursions <10 g/dL were less frequent post-switch versus pre-switch. CONCLUSION: Mean Hb values remained within a narrow range following switching from PEG-Epo to DA in this population of hemodialysis patients. Time trends of mean Hb and DA dose indicate that physicians titrated DA doses post-switch, to attain Hb concentrations comparable to those attained pre-switch with PEG-Epo.","2014","Advances in therapy",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

A search was performed until January 2008 of MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference lists of included trials. SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD (stages III to V). We included dialysis patients and patients with CKD not on dialysis therapy (hereafter referred to as patients with CKD). SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: We included all randomized controlled trials regardless of publication status or language. INTERVENTION: Intravenous (IV) versus oral iron supplementation. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Primary outcomes assessed: absolute hemoglobin (Hb) level or change in Hb level from baseline. We also assessed all-cause mortality, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent requirement, adverse events, ferritin level, and need for renal replacement therapy in patients with CKD. RESULTS: 13 trials were identified, 6 including patients with CKD and 7 including dialysis patients. Compared with oral iron, there was a significantly greater Hb level in dialysis patients treated with IV iron (weighted mean difference, 0.83 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 1.57). Meta-regression showed a positive association between Hb level increase and IV iron dose administered and a negative association with baseline Hb level. For patients with CKD, there was a small but significant difference in Hb level favoring the IV iron group (weighted mean difference, 0. 31 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0. 53). Data for all-cause mortality were sparse, and there was no difference in adverse events between the IV- and oral-treated patients. LIMITATIONS: There was significant heterogeneity between trials.

However, the experience of its use from clinical perspectives post-approval is lacking. Aim Using a clinical practice context, this study aims to compare Roxadustat's effectiveness and tolerability with Erythropoietin (EPO) in patients with renal anemia undergoing dialysis. Methods We examined the clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of renal anemia on dialysis who were prescribed Roxadustat or Erythropoietin at the department of nephrology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University from January 2021 to December 2021. Eligible hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with renal anemia, aged >18 or <75 years, without infection, active bleeding, and malignancy were recruited. These patients received Roxadustat or EPO based on the preferential prescription choice made by the nephrologists of the department. We retrospectively attempted to determine the treatment response measured by the change in hemoglobin rate, from baseline up to six months. We also explored the impact of various factors on the treatment response and reported adverse events. Results A total of 106 patients have been included in the final analysis, with 53 patients in each group. The mean age of the study group was 49.9 ± 13.6 years with the main Hb level at the baseline of 8.1 g/dL ± 1.23 g/dl. The gain of hemoglobin from the baseline averaged over six months was 2.2 ± 2.11 g/dl in the Roxadustat group compared with 1.1 ± 1.67 g/dL in the EPO group (p=0.01). As compared to EPO,Roxadustat reduced the total cholesterol level by -0.59 ± 1.08 mmol/l versus -0.01 ± 1.28 mmol/l (p=0012) and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by -0.48 ± 1.07 mmol/l versus -0.47 ± 1.05 (p=0.017) in the first three months. Associated factors with a non-response to treatment were age greater than 65 years (OR=6, 95% CI: 1.23-32.46, p=0.02), hypertension (OR=3.5, 95%CI: 0.89-13.25, p=0.060), and heart failure (OR=4.18, 95%CI:4.18 1.04-20.39, p=0.040). Although the proportion of hospitalization and infection was higher in the EPO group and the incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, nausea) and blood transfusions were higher in the Roxadustat group, there were no statistically significant differences.

","Minutolo R. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but its incidence in nephrology settings is poorly investigated. Similarly, the risks of adverse outcomes associated with new-onset anemia are not known. METHODS: We performed a pooled analysis of three observational cohort studies including 1031 non-anemic CKD patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) regularly followed in renal clinics. We estimated the incidence of mild anemia (hemoglobin 11-12 g/dL in women and 11-13 g/dL in men) and severe anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL or use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) during a 3-year follow-up period. Thereafter we estimated the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and all-cause death associated with new-onset mild and severe anemia. RESULTS: The mean age was 63 ± 14 years, 60% were men and 20% had diabetes. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 37 ± 13 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and the median proteinuria was 0.4 g/day [interquartile range (IQR) 0.1-1.1]. The incidence of mild and severe anemia was 13.7/100 patients-year and 6.2/100 patients-year, respectively. Basal predictors of either mild or severe anemia were diabetes, lower hemoglobin, higher serum phosphate, eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and proteinuria >0.50 g/day. Male sex, moderate CKD (eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and moderate proteinuria (0.15-0.50 g/day) predicted only mild anemia. The incidence of anemia increased progressively with CKD stages (from 8.77 to 76.59/100 patients-year) and the proteinuria category (from 13.99 to 25.02/100 patients-year). During a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 232 patients reached ESKD and 135 died. Compared with non-anemic patients, mild anemia was associated with a higher adjusted risk of ESKD {hazard ratio [HR] 1.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.98]} and all-cause death [HR 1.55 (95% CI 1.04-2.32)]. Severe anemia was associated with an even higher risk of ESKD [HR 1.73 (95% CI 1.20-2.51)] and death [HR 1.83 (95% CI 1.05-3.19)]. CONCLUSIONS: New-onset anemia is frequent, particularly in patients with more severe renal damage and in those with diabetes mellitus.

We conducted a 15-year prospective cohort study of 132,250 Japanese subjects aged 40 to 79 years who participated in annual health checkups from 1993. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare freedom from new-onset AF between groups classified by estimated glomerular filtration rate grade, Hb grade, and their combination. Cox proportional hazard model analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for new-onset AF. During a 13.8-year mean follow-up period, 1,232 (0.93%) subjects with new-onset AF were identified. Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and lower Hb grades were significantly associated with a higher incidence of new-onset AF. Multivariate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of new-onset AF were 1.38 (1.21 to 1.56) for mild CKD group, 2.56 (2.09 to 3.13) for CKD group, and 1.50 (1.24 to 1.83) for anemia group. Borderline Hb level was not significantly associated with increased risk for new-onset AF (HR 1.07, CI 0.91 to 1.25, p = 0.4284). In the model with interaction term between CKD and anemia, the risk was significantly higher (p = 0.0343 for the interaction) than that predicted by each factor independently.

However, ESAs are frequently reported to result in improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The purpose of this review is to evaluate the magnitude and nature of ESA-associated improvements in HRQOL, as well as to understand how to interpret the clinical significance of HRQOL data. HRQOL findings should be analyzed not by statistical significance but rather by using a minimal clinically important difference approach, or, alternatively, a distribution-based approach (such as Cohen's effect size). HRQOL domains that are most improved with ESAs relate to physical symptoms, vitality, energy, and performance; domains of social functioning and mental health show modest improvement, whereas the domains of emotional functioning and pain show very little improvement. Additional domains not measured by commonly used instruments (such as the SF-36) that have been shown to improve with ESAs include sleep, cognitive functioning, and sexual functioning. The maximal increase in HRQOL per incremental increase in hemoglobin appears to occur in the range of 10-12 g/dl. Beyond this range, additional normalization of hemoglobin (to 12-14 g/dl) results in continued (albeit blunted) improvements in HRQOL.","2009","Kidney international"," The purpose of this review is to evaluate the magnitude and nature of ESA-associated improvements in HRQOL , as well as to understand how to interpret the clinical significance of HRQOL data ","Review",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Many safety concerns have emerged regarding the use of ESAs, including an increased occurrence of cardiovascular events and vascular access thrombosis. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase (PH) enzyme inhibitors are a new class of agents for the treatment of anemia in CKD. These agents work by stabilizing the HIF complex and stimulating endogenous erythropoietin production even in patients with end-stage kidney disease. HIF-PH inhibitors improve iron mobilization to the bone marrow. They are administered orally, which may be a more favorable route for patients not undergoing hemodialysis. By inducing considerably lower but more consistent blood erythropoietin levels than ESAs, HIF-PH inhibitors may be associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular effects at comparable hemoglobin levels, although this has yet to be proved in long-term clinical trials. One significant concern regarding the long-term use of these agents is their possible effect on tumor growth. There are 4 such agents undergoing phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in the United States; this report provides a focused review of HIF-PH inhibitors and their potential clinical utility in the management of anemia of CKD.","2017","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Different reviews have focused on evaluating the safety and efficacy of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (MPG-EPO), a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, in CKD patients regardless of dialysis dependency and others have studied this novel agent exclusively in CKD patients receiving dialysis. AIM OF THE REVIEW: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MPG-EPO compared with other erythropoiesis stimulating agents (in particular darbepoetin alfa) for the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients. METHODS: A systematic review of original studies published mainly in MEDLINE, Cochrane Database, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, clinical trials registries, and Google Scholar was carried out to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MPG-EPO with other erythropoiesis stimulating agents or placebo among patients with anemia of CKD who were not yet receiving dialysis. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers using standardized data abstraction tool. RESULTS: Four trials involving 1,155 patients were included in the review. The changes in hemoglobin level from the baseline reported by the reviewed studies demonstrate that MPG-EPO was clinically non-inferior to darbepoetin alfa. In addition, the studies documented that MPG-EPO-treated patients experienced a lower rate of hemoglobin level above the target range of 12-13 g/dL than darbepoetin-treated patients. The proportion of patients requiring RBC transfusion was higher among patients who received darbepoetin alfa than those who received MPG-EPO. However, the time to hemoglobin response was longer with MPG-EPO than with darbepoetin. Finally, the incidences of serious adverse events were similar between the two therapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: There are currently only few well-designed head-to-head RCTs investigating the efficacy and safety of MPG-EPO compared with other ESAs in non-dialysis-dependent patients. MPG-EPO therapy compared with darbepoetin alfa has demonstrated favorable effects of increasing and maintaining hemoglobin concentrations to recommended target levels. This mini-review is not conclusive due to limited number of studies. Therefore, the beneficial effects and tolerability of MPG-EPO among non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients should be further investigated, given the economic and clinical benefits of managing anemia in this population.","2014","International journal of clinical pharmacy"," AIM OF THE REVIEW : To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MPG-EPO compared with other erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( in particular darbepoetin alfa ) for the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients ","Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Shiferaw W. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease presents significant impacts on patients, the health-care system and financial resources. There is a significant variation in the primary studies on risk factors of anemia in this patient population across the globe. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the risk factors of anemia among chronic kidney disease patients at the global level. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, African Journals Online, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched and complemented by manual searches. A Funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to determine publication bias. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects modes were applied to estimate pooled effect sizes, odds ratios, and 95% confidence interval across studies. Analysis was performed using STATA™ Version 14 software. RESULT: A total of 28 studies with 24,008 study participants were included in this study.

","Sun C. et al.","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that negatively impacts the quality of life and is associated with numerous adverse outcomes. Excess levels of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin are thought to contribute to anemia in CKD patients by decreasing iron availability from the diet and from body stores. Adenine treatment in rats has been proposed as an animal model of anemia of CKD with high hepcidin levels that mirrors the condition in human patients. METHODS: We developed a modified adenine-induced kidney disease model with a higher survival rate than previously reported models, while maintaining persistent kidney disease and anemia. We then tested whether the small molecule bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor LDN-193189, which was previously shown to lower hepcidin levels in rodents, mobilized iron into the plasma and improved iron-restricted erythropoiesis in this model. RESULTS: Adenine-treated rats exhibited increased hepatic hepcidin mRNA, decreased serum iron, increased spleen iron content, low hemoglobin (Hb) and inappropriately low erythropoietin (EPO) levels relative to the degree of anemia. LDN-193189 administration to adenine-treated rats lowered hepatic hepcidin mRNA, mobilized stored iron into plasma and increased Hb content of reticulocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that hepcidin lowering agents may provide a new therapeutic strategy to improve iron availability for erythropoiesis in CKD.","2013","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Macdougall I. et al.","BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting most patients on hemodialysis and imposing a substantial clinical burden. Treatment with iron supplementation increases hemoglobin levels and can reduce the severity of anemia in patients with CKD. While correcting anemia in these patients is an important therapeutic goal, there is a lack of long-term trials directly comparing intravenous iron therapies in patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis. METHODS/DESIGN: The Ferumoxytol for Anemia of CKD Trial (FACT) is a 13-month, open-label, randomized, multicenter, international, prospective study with 2 substudies. Entry criteria for the main study include adults with IDA (defined as hemoglobin <11.5 g/dL [<115.0 g/L] and a transferrin saturation <30%), serum ferritin <800 ng/mL (<1798 pmol/L), and receiving hemodialysis for ≥3 months. Patients are randomized to receive ferumoxytol (1.02 g over 2 doses) or iron sucrose (1.0 g over 10 doses) during the initial 5-week treatment period. Those with persistent/recurrent IDA over the 11-month observation period will receive additional 5-week treatment periods, as appropriate. The primary efficacy endpoint of the main study is the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 for each treatment period. The secondary efficacy endpoints include the mean change in transferrin saturation from Baseline to Week 5 and the proportion of patients with a hemoglobin increase of ≥1.0 g/dL at any time from Baseline to Week 5. Safety will be assessed through an examination of the adverse event profile over the course of the study. An ""oxidative stress"" substudy in approximately 100 patients will assess the effects of treatment on biomarkers of oxidative stress/inflammation during the initial 5-week treatment period, and a magnetic resonance imaging substudy in approximately 70 patients will assess the potential for iron deposition in target tissues over 24 months. DISCUSSION: FACT fulfills the need for a long-term comparative trial in patients with IDA and CKD receiving hemodialysis. The efficacy and safety results will provide useful information for guiding therapy in this population. Two hundred ninety-six patients have been enrolled, and completion of the main study is expected soon.

,"37095342"," Treatment satisfaction with molidustat in CKD-related anemia in non-dialysis patients: a post-hoc analysis of two clinical trials. ","Yamamoto H. et al.","BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are the standard treatment for patients with renal anemia to increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels and reduce the need for blood transfusions. However, treatments targeting high Hb levels require high doses of ESAs administered intravenously, which is associated with an elevated risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Furthermore, there have been some problems such as hemoglobin variability and low achievement of target hemoglobin due to the shorter half-lives of ESAs. Consequently, erythropoietin-promoting medications, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors, have been developed. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medicine version II (TSQM-II) domain scores relative to baseline in each trial, to assess patient satisfaction with molidustat versus darbepoetin alfa. METHODS: This post-hoc analysis of two clinical trials compared treatment satisfaction with an HIF-PH inhibitor, molidustat, versus a standard ESA, darbepoetin alfa, as part of therapy in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal anemia. RESULTS: Exploratory outcome data using the TSQM-II showed that both arms in both trials had enhanced treatment satisfaction over the course of the study period, as well as improvements in most TSQM-II domains at week 24 of treatment. Molidustat was associated with convenience domain scores at multiple time points depending on the trial. More patients were highly satisfied with the convenience of molidustat than that of darbepoetin alfa. Patients treated with molidustat had increased global satisfaction domain scores compared with those treated with darbepoetin alfa; however, the differences in global satisfaction domain scores were not significant. CONCLUSION: These patient-reported satisfaction outcomes support the use of molidustat as a patient-centered treatment option for CKD-related anemia.

Therefore, it is important to investigate the associated factors of SRD in AS patients to inhibit CKD progression to SRD before AS. Sex differences exist in the renal function. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of SRD and its associated factors among AS patients by sex. METHODS: Our cross-sectional study included patients admitted within 24 h of AS onset between 2013 and 2019 with available pre-stroke medication information. We used the Cockcroft-Gault equation for calculating the creatinine clearance (Ccr) and defined SRD as a Ccr < 30 mL/min. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify the independent factors associated with SRD. RESULTS: Out of 4294 patients, 3472 matched our criteria.

METHODS: In a large population-based cross-sectional study comprising of a diverse population, each participant underwent a questionnaire-based interview and laboratory testing for hematological analysis. A hemoglobin (HGB) concentration of < 12 g/dL in non-pregnant women and < 13 g/dL in men were defined anemic. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between anemia and its potential determinants. RESULTS: Data on 29,550 (96.87%) males and non-pregnant females between 20-65 years of age (mean age: 41.90 ± 11.88 years; female sex: 63.58%; Arab ethnicity: 48.65%), whose HGB level was available, were included in the study. The mean ± SD HGB concentration was 13.75 ± 1.65 g/dL. The age- and sex-standardized prevalence rate of anemia was 10.86% (95% CI: 10.51-11.23%). The most prevalent degree was mild anemia (7.71%, 95% CI: 7.40-8.03%) and only 0.17% were severely anemic. Of those considered anemic, the highest proportion was related to normochromic/microcytic (50.65%), followed by hypochromic/microcytic (30.29%).

In clinical studies to date, daprodustat has been administered orally as a once-daily regimen. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study characterized the initial dose-hemoglobin response as well as the efficacy and safety of three times weekly (TIW) daprodustat in hemodialysis patients switched from stable recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO), in accordance with a TIW hemodialysis schedule. METHODS: 103 patients on hemodialysis with baseline hemoglobin of 9.0 to 11.5 g/dL and previously receiving a stable dose of rhEPO or its analogs were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive daprodustat 10, 15, 25, or 30 mg or placebo TIW over 29 days. RESULTS: Mean baseline hemoglobin was 10.6 g/dL for the placebo group and each daprodustat cohort. Daprodustat produced dose-dependent changes in mean hemoglobin from baseline to day 29. Using a Bayesian approach, the estimated dose conversion ratio between once-daily and TIW daprodustat was ~ 2.0 across the evaluated dose range using an E(max) model. Daprodustat was generally well tolerated, with an adverse event (AE) profile consistent with the hemodialysis population. CONCLUSIONS: These data help inform the appropriate dose conversion ratio to be applied to daily doses to obtain equivalent daprodustat TIW doses and suggest TIW treatment with daprodustat can treat anemia of CKD safely, supporting future long-term studies for this indication using a TIW dosing regimen.

","De B. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Preoperative anemia is common in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and has been linked to a poorer outcome--including a higher 1-year mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of successful TAVI on baseline anemia. METHODS: A total of 253 patients who survived at least 1 year following TAVI were included in this study. The prevalence, predictors and clinical outcome of hemoglobin (Hb)-recovery were assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of baseline anemia was 49% (n = 124)--recovery from anemia occurred in 40% of the anemic patients (n = 49) at 1 year after TAVI with an increase in mean Hb-level of 1.35 g/dL from baseline. This increase was not related to an improvement in renal function. At multivariate analysis, a high peak gradient (OR 4.82, P = 0.003) was shown to be an independent predictor for Hb-recovery, while blood transfusion (OR 0.31, P = 0.038) and chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR 0.33, P = 0.043) were identified as negative predictors at, respectively, one and two years after TAVI. When compared to patients without baseline anemia, those anemic patients with Hb-recovery had a similar functional improvement (OR 0.98, P = 0.975), whereas those without Hb-recovery had a significantly lower likelihood of functional improvement with ≧2 NYHA classes (OR 0.49, P = 0.034) and a higher likelihood of re-hospitalization within the first year after TAVI (OR 1.91, P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Recovery from anemia occurs in 40% of anemic patients at 1 year after TAVI--mainly in those with a high gradient and without CKD. Blood transfusion was found to have a transient adverse effect on this Hb-recovery. Finally, anemic patients without Hb-recovery experience less functional improvement and have a higher re-hospitalization rate within the first year after TAVI.","2014","PloS one"," The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of successful TAVI on baseline anemia ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Hoshino J. et al.","OBJECTIVE: Conflicting findings and knowledge gaps exist regarding links between anemia, physical activity, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and mortality in moderate-to-advanced CKD. Using the CKD Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, we report associations of hemoglobin (Hgb) with HRQOL and physical activity, and associations of Hgb and physical activity with CKD progression and mortality in stage 3-5 nondialysis (ND)-CKD patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospectively collected data were analyzed from 2,121 ND-CKD stage 3-5 patients, aged ≥18 years, at 43 nephrologist-run US and Brazil CKD Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study-participating clinics. Cross-sectional associations were assessed of Hgb levels with HRQOL and physical activity levels (from validated Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument and Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity surveys). CKD progression (first of ≥40% estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] decline, eGFR<10 mL/min/1.73 m(2), or end-stage kidney disease) and all-cause mortality with Hgb and physical activity levels were also evaluated. Linear, logistic, and Cox regression analyses were adjusted for country, demographics, smoking, eGFR, serum albumin, very high proteinuria, and 13 comorbidities. RESULTS: HRQOL was worse, with severe anemia (Hgb<10 g/dL), but also evident for mild/moderate anemia (Hgb 10-12 g/dL), relative to Hgb>12 g/dL. Odds of being highly physically active were substantially greater at Hgb>10.5 g/dL. Lower Hgb was strongly associated with greater CKD progression and mortality, even after extensive adjustment. Physical inactivity was strongly associated with greater mortality and weakly associated with CKD progression. Possible residual confounding is a limitation. CONCLUSION: This multicenter international study provides real-world observational evidence for greater HRQOL, physical activity, lower CKD progression, and greater survival in ND-CKD patients with Hgb levels >12 g/dL, exceeding current treatment guideline recommendations. These findings help inform future studies aimed at understanding the impact of new anemia therapies and physical activity regimens on improving particular dimensions of ND-CKD patient well-being and clinical outcomes.","2020","Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation"," OBJECTIVE : Conflicting findings and knowledge gaps exist regarding links between anemia , physical activity , health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) progression , and mortality in moderate-to-advanced CKD ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

LI","Locatelli F. et al.","INTRODUCTION. The objective of this survey was to describe the nephrologists attitude on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD stages 3, 4 and 5), with iron deficiency anemia and no response/intolerance to oral iron therapy. Furthermore, this survey describes the nephrologists view about the impact of lack of anemia correction on patient health, as well as the influence of organization and management of nephrological centers on IV iron management. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 60 nephrologists were interviewed via web by using an interactive simulation that investigates nephrologists clinical and therapeutic approach on 3 different types of patients; subsequently, a questionnaire was administered with in-deeper questions. RESULTS. Regarding the first virtual patient, 64% of nephrologists still choose oral iron, while IV iron was chosen by 16% of them. 36% opted for ESA. For the other two virtual patients the most selected treatments were combinations of oral iron + ESA (42% and 36%) or IV iron + ESA (21% and 38%), respectively. According to what was perceived by nephrologists, issues related to IV iron are: patient discomfort due to frequent hospital transfers for IV administration (50%), inadequate center organization (48%), fear of damaging the venous tree (40%). CONCLUSIONS. Half of the nephrologists stated they are unsatisfied with available iron therapies. Difficult therapy management and restrictions of health structure were identified as barriers to the prescription of IV iron therapy. A smaller number of administrations and less free-iron toxicity are expected from nephrologists from the new iron preparations for the management of iron deficiency in patients not responding/intolerant to oral iron therapy.","2013","Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia"," The objective of this survey was to describe the nephrologists attitude on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD stages 3 , 4 and 5 ) , with iron deficiency anemia and no response / intolerance to oral iron therapy ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Wee H. et al.","BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The association of CKD-related complications such as anemia and mineral and bone disorders (MBD) with HRQoL in pre-dialysis patients is not well-studied. As such, this study aimed to determine the association of anemia and MBD with HRQoL in pre-dialysis patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 311 adult pre-dialysis patients with stage 3-5 CKD from an acute-care hospital in Singapore. Patients' HRQoL were assessed using Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF™) and EuroQol 5 Dimensions-3 levels (EQ5D-3L). HRQoL between patients with and without anemia or MBD were compared by separate hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses using various HRQoL scales as dependent variables, adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: After adjusting for MBD, anemia was associated with lower HRQoL scores on work status (WS), physical functioning (PF) and role physical [β (SE): -10.9 (4.18), p = 0.010; -3.0 (1.28), p = 0.018; and -4.2 (1.40), p = 0.003, respectively]. However, significance was lost after adjustments for sociodemographic variables. Patients with MBD had poorer HRQoL with respect to burden of kidney disease, WS, PF and general health [(β (SE): -7.9 (3.88), p = 0.042; -9.5 (3.99), p = 0.018; -3.0 (1.22) p = 0.014; -3.6 (1.48), p = 0.015, respectively]. Although these remained significant after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, significance was lost after adjusting for clinical variables, particularly pill burden. This is of clinical importance due to the high pill burden of CKD patients, especially from medications for the management of multiple comorbidities such as cardiovascular and mineral and bone diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Neither anemia nor MBD was associated with HRQoL in our pre-dialysis patients. Instead, higher total daily pill burden was associated with worse HRQoL. Medication reconciliation should therefore be routinely performed by clinicians and pharmacists to reduce total daily pill burden where possible.","2016","Health and quality of life outcomes"," As such , this study aimed to determine the association of anemia and MBD with HRQoL in pre-dialysis patients ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Yang C. et al.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health burden, and anemia is common among patients with CKD. However, less is known regarding the longitudinal association between anemia and deterioration of kidney function among the general population. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study is a nationally representative survey for households with members aged ≥ 45 years. Participants without creatinine and demographic data in 2011 and 2015 were excluded. Anemia was defined according to definitions of the World Health Organization. Rapid decline in kidney function was defined as a ≥16.9% (quartile 3) decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using the CKD-EPI equation during 2011-2015. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic splines were used to explore their relationship. Altogether, 7210 eligible participants were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 8.8 years. Rapid decline in kidney function occurred among 1802 (25.0%) participants. Those with kidney function decline were more likely to be older, male, and have anemia, lower eGFRs, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (P < 0.05). Anemia, or hemoglobin, was independently associated with rapid decline in kidney function after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.32-2.04; OR = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.87-0.94, respectively). Restricted cubic splines showed a nonlinear relationship between hemoglobin and rapid decline in kidney function, especially for men with anemia (P < 0.05). In conclusion, anemia is an independent risk factor for progression of kidney function among the middle-aged and elderly population. Attentive management and intervention strategies targeting anemia could be effective to reduce the risk of kidney failure and improve the prognosis of the general population.","2020","BioMed research international",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Roxadustat is a novel oral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (PHI), which is administrated for renal anemia. Different from erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), Roxadustat could increase erythropoietin physiologically, improving the therapeutic effects. It has not been so long since Roxadustat was approved by the European Commission (EC). Thus, only a few studies have reported on the treatment of renal anemia using Roxadustat. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Roxadustat in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Nine patients under HD (72±10 years old) were enrolled in this study. Patients received Roxadustat first time or changed from ESAs (5-10 mg, 3 times a week after HD). Observation period was 5.3±2.9 months. RESULTS: Roxadustat treatment effectively increased and maintained hemoglobin levels. Levels of ferritin and C-reactive protein tended to decrease, but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant adverse effects were observed in all patients during the study.

","Sah S. and Adhikary L.","BACKGROUND: CKD has been recognized as risk factors for 25(OH) D deficiency, and Low levels of 25(OH) D have been suggested to be a trigger factor of decreased level of Hb. However, there is lack of information about the magnitude of 25(OH) D deficiency and Hb level in Nepalese CKD patients. Therefore, the aim of present study was to investigate the prevalence of abnormal 25(OH) D in non-dialyzed CKD patients, and further to examine its association with Hb level. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we examined 172 clinically stable patients with an eGFR at CKD stage2-5 not on dialysis. Serum 25(OH) D, Hb, levels were evaluated as a core variables and the other variables such as age, sex, co-morbidities (HTN, DM), eGFR, Hb, iPTH, serum phosphate, albumin, calcium, and phosphate level were evaluated as a covariates. Serum 25(OH) D, Hb levels and the factors associated with 25(OH) D level were evaluated. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of abnormal 25(OH) D metabolite (< 30 ng/mL) in this predialysis patients were (87.8%), with 32 and 55.8% deficiency and insufficiency 25(OH) D metabolite, respectively. On regression analysis, serum 25(OH) D was positively associated with male subjects (P = 0.02), serum albumin(P = 0.002), and eGFR (P = 0.042), while inversely associated with age (P = 0.006), iPTH(P = 0.025). Hb concentration was found to be positively correlated with 25(OH) D (P < 0.05) in both univariate as well as in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of abnormal 25(OH) D metabolite was observed in early CKD patients.

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between daprodustat dose and hemoglobin response in Japanese patients on hemodialysis (HD) with anemia in a 4-week, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After interrupting their erythropoiesis-stimulating agent for between 2 and 8 weeks, subjects with hemoglobin 8.5-10.5 g/dL were randomized to placebo or daprodustat 4, 6, 8, or 10 mg orally once daily. Hemoglobin, erythropoietin (EPO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels during therapy were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 97 randomized subjects completed the study. Mean baseline hemoglobin ranged from 9.68 to 9.92 g/dL across groups. After 4-week administration, mean hemoglobin changes were -0.28, -0.01, 0.54, and 0.97 g/dL in the 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg groups, respectively, as compared to -1.41 g/dL for placebo. Dose-dependent increase in plasma EPO concentration were observed up to 8 mg, with the 10 mg dose responses being similar to 8 mg. Plasma VEGF concentrations were minimally changed, even though 5 subjects treated with 6-10 mg reached EPO >500 mIU/mL. CONCLUSION: Daprodustat 4-10 mg once-daily produced dose-dependent increase in hemoglobin relative to placebo in Japanese HD subjects.

RESULT: Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level increased with the progression of chronic kidney diseases. Higher neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels were observed in patients with chronic kidney diseases stage 3b compared with healthy individuals (P<0.05), while the patients with chronic kidney diseases stage 5 showed higher levels compared with other chronic kidney diseases stages (P<0.01). Moreover, the ROC curve showed that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin had a better diagnostic performance from the chronic kidney diseases stage 3b to 5 (P<0.05). In addition, the serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels in patient with chronic kidney diseases were negatively correlated with body mass index, number of red blood cells, hemoglobin, transferrin, the estimatedglomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum calcium (P<0.01); and were positively correlated with mean arterial blood pressure, blood BUN, SCr and alpha 1 microglobulin, beta 2 microglobulin, urinary inhibition C, homocysteine, PTH levels, neutrophils ratio, free serum ferritin and c-reactive protein (P<0.01); while no significant correlation was found with gender, and age (P>0.05).

It is well established that FGF-23 synthesis is directly induced by positive phosphate (P) balance. On the other hand, P-lowering treatments such as nutritional P restriction, P binders and dialysis are capable of reducing FGF-23 levels. However, there are many uncertainties regarding the possibility of adopting FGF-23 to guide the clinical decision-making process in the context of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Furthermore, the best assay to adopt for measurement of FGF-23 levels (namely the intact vs the C-terminal one) remains to be determined, especially in conditions capable of altering the synthesis as well as the cleavage of the intact and biologically active molecule, as occurs in the presence of CKD and its complications. This Editorial discusses the main insights provided by the post hoc analysis of the NOPHOS trial, with particular attention given to evidence-based peculiarities of the intact and the C-terminal assays available for measuring FGF-23 levels, especially in patients receiving additive P-lowering therapy in the presence of inflammation, anemia and iron deficiency.","2023","Clinical kidney journal",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

However, the impact of Hb-var in advanced NDD-CKD on outcomes after dialysis initiation remains unknown. METHODS: Among 11,872 US veterans with advanced NDD-CKD transitioning to dialysis between October 2007 through September 2011, we assessed Hb-var calculated from the residual SD of at least 3 Hb values during the last 6 months before dialysis initiation (prelude period) using within-subject linear regression models, and stratified into quartiles. Outcomes included post-transition all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality, assessed in Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, length of hospitalization, medications, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), type of vascular access, Hb parameters (baseline Hb [i.e., intercept] and change in Hb [i.e., slope]), and number of Hb measurements. RESULTS: Higher prelude Hb-var was associated with use of iron and antiplatelet agents, tunneled dialysis catheter use, higher levels of baseline Hb, change in Hb, eGFR, and serum ferritin. After multivariable adjustment, higher prelude Hb-var was associated with higher post-ESRD all-cause and infection-related mortality, but not cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratios [95% CI] for the highest [vs. lowest] quartile of Hb-var, 1.10 [1.02-1.19], 1.28 [0.93-1.75], and 0.93 [0.79-1.10], respectively).

We randomly assigned Japanese patients to oral roxadustat three times weekly or to darbepoetin alfa injections once weekly, titrating doses to maintain hemoglobin between 10-12 g/dl. The primary end point was change of average hemoglobin from baseline to weeks 18-24 (∆Hb(18-24)). Secondary end points were average hemoglobin and proportion of patients with hemoglobin between 10-12 g/dl (maintenance rate) at weeks 18-24, and iron parameters. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events and adjudicated ophthalmologic findings. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 303 patients to roxadustat (n=151) or darbepoetin alfa (n=152). The difference between roxadustat and darbepoetin alfa in ∆Hb(18-24) was -0.02 g/dl (95% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.15), confirming roxadustat's noninferiority to darbepoetin alfa. Average hemoglobin at weeks 18-24 with roxadustat was 10.99 g/dl (95% confidence interval: 10.88 to 11.10), confirming its efficacy. Among patients with one or more hemoglobin value during weeks 18-24, the maintenance rate was 95.2% with roxadustat and 91.3% with darbepoetin alfa. Serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation remained clinically stable with roxadustat; transferrin and total iron binding capacity increased through week 4 before stabilizing. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nasopharyngitis, shunt stenosis, diarrhea, contusion, and vomiting. The proportion of patients with new or worsening retinal hemorrhage was 32.4% with roxadustat and 36.6% with darbepoetin alfa.

","Yamamoto H. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are the current standard of care for anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients not undergoing dialysis. Molidustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, is being investigated as an alternative treatment for renal anemia. Molidustat was evaluated in five phase 3 studies, the molidustat once daily improves renal anemia by inducing erythropoietin (MIYABI) program. The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of molidustat in Japanese patients with renal anemia not undergoing dialysis and previously treated with ESAs. METHODS: This was a 52-week, active-controlled, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 study in Japanese patients with anemia due to CKD (stages 3-5). Molidustat was initiated at 25 mg or 50 mg once daily according to previous ESA dose. The ESA darbepoetin alfa (darbepoetin) was initiated at a starting dose in accordance with the previous ESA dose and injected subcutaneously once every 2 or 4 weeks. Doses were regularly titrated to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the target range of 11.0-13.0 g/dL. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean Hb level and its change from baseline during the evaluation period (weeks 30-36). The safety outcomes included evaluation of all adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 164 patients were randomized to receive molidustat (n = 82) or darbepoetin (n = 82). Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Mean (standard deviation) Hb levels at baseline were 11.31 (0.68) g/dL for molidustat and 11.27 (0.64) g/dL for darbepoetin. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) for mean Hb levels during the evaluation period for molidustat (11.67 [11.48-11.85] g/dL) and darbepoetin (11.53 [11.31-11.74] g/dL) was within the target range. Based on a noninferiority margin of 1.0 g/dL, molidustat was noninferior to darbepoetin regarding the change in mean Hb level during the evaluation period from baseline, with a least squares mean (95% CI) difference (molidustat-darbepoetin) of 0.13 (-0.15, 0.40) g/dL. The proportion of patients who reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 92.7% for molidustat and 96.3% for darbepoetin. TEAEs leading to death were reported in 2 patients (2.4%) in the molidustat group and none in the darbepoetin group; serious TEAEs were reported in 32.9% and 26.8% of patients, respectively. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Molidustat was noninferior to darbepoetin and maintained Hb levels in the prespecified target range in patients with renal anemia not undergoing dialysis and previously treated with ESA. Molidustat was well tolerated, and no new safety signal was observed.","2021","American journal of nephrology",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Dabrowska M. et al.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the anemia prevalence and the correlation between complete blood count (CBC) analysis and renal function parameters in HIV-1-infected population. METHODS: It was a single-center study set in Warsaw (Poland) over a 3-year period. The study was performed in 214 adult HIV-1- infected patients (180 males and 34 females, aged from 20 to 69 years old, mean age 39.55 years, 130 on combined antiretroviral therapy, cART). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the re-expressed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas. In statistical analyses U Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation test as logistic regression analysis was used. RESULTS: 25.2% of studied patients were anemic. In all of them, estimated GFR (eGFR) was positively correlated with red blood cells (RBC) and platelet (PLT) count, and negatively correlated with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). All these correlations were statistically significant (p < 0.001) and independent of gender and used type of eGFR formula. In logistic regression analysis, lower eGFR strongly predicted lower RBC and PLT levels (p < 0.0001; OR 0.08, 95%CI: 0.03, 0.22 and OR 0.99, 95%CI: 0.987, 0.993, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a strong association between CBC and renal function in ARV-treated HIV-infected patients who fulfilled the criteria of anemia. Consequently, eGFR in all HIV-infected subjects with anemia, especially on treatment with nephrotoxic drugs and concomitant thrombocytopenia, should be monitored more frequently then standardly recommended every 3-6 months.","2012","Current HIV research"," OBJECTIVES : To determine the anemia prevalence and the correlation between complete blood count ( CBC ) analysis and renal function parameters in HIV-1-infected population ","Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Lee W. et al.","BACKGROUND: The effect of anemia on patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains a controversial issue. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of anemia on STEMI patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2005 to December 2014, 1751 patients experienced STEMI checked serum hemoglobin initially before any administration of fluids or IV medications. 1751 patients then received primary percutaneous intervention immediately. A total of 1388 patients were enrolled in the non-anemia group because their serum hemoglobin level was more than 13 g/L in males, and 12 g/L in females. A total of 363 patients were enrolled in the anemia group because their serum hemoglobin level was less than 13 g/L in males, and 12 g/L in females. Higher incidences of major adverse cerebral cardiac events (22.9% vs. 33.8%; p<0.001) were also noted in the anemia group, and these were related to higher incidence of cardiovascular mortality (6.5% vs. 20.4%; p<0.001). A higher incidence of all-cause mortality (8.6% vs. 27.7%; p<0.001) was also noted in the anemia group.

The primary cardiovascular safety end point was a composite measure of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke). MACE plus (MACE+; MACE plus unstable angina and heart failure requiring hospitalization) and all-cause mortality were key secondary safety end points. These safety end points were adjudicated. RESULTS: A total of 4277 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD were randomized (roxadustat, n=2391; placebo, n=1886). Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups; the mean (SD) hemoglobin was 9.1 (0.7) g/dl and mean eGFR was 20 (12) ml/min per 1.73 m(2).

OBJECTIVES: To study the association between reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated according to five equations with mortality in the oldest-old. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: Municipality of Biella, Piedmont, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: 700 subjects aged 85 and older participating in the ""Health and Anemia"" Study in 2007-2008. MEASUREMENTS: GFR was estimated using five creatinine-based equations: the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), MAYO Clinic, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and Berlin Initiative Study-1 (BIS-1). Survival analysis was used to study mortality in subjects with reduced eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) compared to subjects with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). RESULTS: Prevalence of reduced GFR was 90.7% with the C-G, 48.1% with MDRD, 23.3% with MAYO, 53.6% with CKD-EPI and 84.4% with BIS-1. After adjustment for confounders, two-year mortality was significantly increased in subjects with reduced eGFR using BIS-1 and C-G equations (adjusted HRs: 2.88 and 3.30, respectively). Five-year mortality was significantly increased in subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) using MAYO, CKD-EPI and, in a graduated fashion in reduced eGFR categories, MDRD. After 5 years, oldest old with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) showed a significantly higher risk of death whichever equation was used (adjusted HRs between 2.04 and 2.70). CONCLUSION: In the oldest old, prevalence of reduced eGFR varies noticeably depending on the equation used. In this population, risk of mortality was significantly higher for reduced GFR estimated with the BIS-1 and C-G equations over the short term. Though after five years the MDRD appeared on the whole a more consistent predictor, differences in mortality prediction among equations over the long term were less apparent.

","Yan Z. and Xu G.","Anemia is a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), primarily due to insufficient secretion of erythropoietin (EPO) by the kidney. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are used to treat anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. A poor response to ESAs has been associated with inflammation. Inflammation can affect erythrocytes and its production in many ways, but mainly through the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to stimulate the synthesis of hepcidin in the liver. Hepcidin causes iron insufficiency, which causes erythrocytes to fail to mature normally. In addition, inhibition of bone marrow erythroid precursor cells by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α also affects bone marrow hematopoiesis. These cytokines are also important factors leading to EPO resistance. Roxadustat is a new drug for the treatment of renal anemia. In addition to promoting the production of EPO, clinical trials have shown that it can significantly reduce hepcidin and can potentially be used for the treatment of inflammation-induced anemia in CKD.","2020","Frontiers in medicine",,"Clinical trial",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

We studied 207 type 2 diabetic patients (92 women and 115 men). Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) <13.0g/dL in men and <12.0g/dL in women according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). Overt nephropathy (CKD) was defined as clinical proteinuria and /or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) lower than 60mL/min for more than 3 months. The diabetic patients were divided into 4 groups according to the presence or absence of anemia and/or CKD. Serum HMW adiponectin levels were measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In all 207 patients with type 2 diabetes, serum total and HMW adiponectin levels were correlated positively with age, the duration of diabetes, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, urinary albumin, and serum erythropoietin, whereas negative correlations were found with body mass index, triglyceride, eGFR, Hb, hematocrit, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. A stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that among several significant variables, Hb had the strongest independent influence on HMW adiponectin (beta =-0.487, P < 0.001).

RESULTS: Both CKD-3/4/5 and CKD-5D populations showed a dose-dependent increase in EPO concentrations and consequent increases in reticulocytes and Hb levels. Percentages of GSK1278863 participants with an Hb level increase > 1.0g/dL (CKD-3/4/5) and >0.5g/dL (CKD-5D) were 63% to 91% and 71% to 89%, respectively. Per-protocol-defined criteria, high rate of increase in Hb level, or high absolute Hb value was the main cause for withdrawal (CKD-3/4/5, 30%; CKD-5D, 22%). A dose-dependent decrease in hepcidin levels and increase in total and unsaturated iron binding were observed in all GSK1278863-treated patients. LIMITATIONS: Sparse pharmacokinetic sampling may have limited covariate characterization.

We found that HIF-PHIs improved the level of hemoglobin (Hb) (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.40; 95% CI: 0.96-1.84; p < 0.001), response rate of Hb (risk ratio [RR] 5.95; 95% CI: 3.95-8.96; p < 0.001), and total iron-binding capacity (WMD 42.94; 95% CI: 31.39-54.49; p < 0.001), while reducing the level of hepcidin (WMD -40.42; 95% CI: -50.44 to -30.39; p < 0.001), ferritin (WMD -64.60; 95% CI: -78.56 to -50.64; p < 0.001), and transferrin saturation (WMD -5.57; 95% CI: -8.53 to -2.61; p < 0.001). Meanwhile, there was no evidence of effect on serum iron (WMD 1.60; 95% CI: -3.72 to 6.93; p = 0.55), nor on the incidence of adverse events (AEs) (RR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.99-1.15; p = 0.51) or of serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 1.14; 95% CI: 0.88-1.46; p = 0.32). CONCLUSION: HIF-PHIs ameliorate renal anemia and rectify iron metabolism in the short term without increasing the incidence of AEs and SAEs.","2020","Nephron",,"Meta analysis",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Hu W. et al.","BACKGROUND: To examine whether elevated glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is associated with hyperfiltration in a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population. METHODS: Anthropometric and biochemical examinations were performed in 2491 individuals from the general population, aged 40-79 years, who participated in the Huaian Diabetes Prevention Program. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from creatinine levels using the CKD-EPI formula. Hyperfiltration was defined as eGFR >90(th) percentile. RESULTS: After adjustment [for age, gender, waistline, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption, cholesterol, log(triglycerides), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, serum uric acid, sodium intake, hypertension, and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers], HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were found to be independently positively associated with eGFR. Additionally, after multivariate adjustment, the odds ratios (95 % CI) for hyperfiltration calculated for a 1-unit increase in HbA1c and FPG were 1.396 (1.089-1.790) and 1.306 (1.117-1.526), respectively. Compared with participants with HbA1c levels <5.7%, the odds ratios (95 % CI) for hyperfiltration were 2.344 (1.025-5.364) in participants with HbA1c levels of 6.21-6.49%, and 2.965 (1.537-5.720) in those with HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5%. CONCLUSION: Elevated HbA1c (≥ 6.21%) is associated with an increased odds of hyperfiltration in middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore whether hyperfiltration increases the odds of diabetic nephropathy in individuals with prediabetes.","2015","BMC endocrine disorders",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Akizawa T. et al.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Daprodustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that stimulates erythropoiesis and regulates genes related to iron metabolism. The efficacy (noninferiority) and safety of daprodustat compared with standard therapy (darbepoetin alfa) was evaluated. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a randomized, phase 3, double-blind, active-control study in Japanese patients receiving hemodialysis with anemia of CKD. Participants' treatment was switched from current erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to daprodustat 4 mg once daily or darbepoetin alfa 10-60 μg once weekly (on the basis of the prestudy ESA dose). Dose was adjusted every 4 weeks for daprodustat or every 2 weeks for darbepoetin alfa, according to a protocol-specified algorithm. The primary end point was mean hemoglobin during weeks 40-52 in the intent-to-treat population. RESULTS: Of 332 participants screened, 271 participants were randomized (safety evaluation: 271 participants; efficacy evaluation: 267 intent-to-treat population). The mean hemoglobin during weeks 40-52 were maintained within the target range in both groups (10.9 g/dl [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 10.8 to 11.0] for daprodustat, and 10.8 g/dl [95% CI, 10.7 to 11.0] for darbepoetin alfa). Daprodustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa, as the lower bound of the confidence interval for the treatment difference (0.1 g/dl; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2 g/dl) was greater than the noninferiority criterion of -1.0 g/dl. For most participants, hemoglobin was maintained within the target range (10.0-12.0 g/dl) during weeks 40-52 (88% daprodustat; 90% darbepoetin alfa). Geometric mean hepcidin levels decreased more at week 52 with daprodustat (-37%; 95% CI, -49 to -23) than with darbepoetin alfa (-20%; 95% CI, -36 to -1), and an increase in total iron-binding capacity was observed in the daprodustat group. Frequency of adverse events were generally similar between daprodustat and darbepoetin alfa.

","Barbieri C. et al.","Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) anemia is one of the main common comorbidities in patients undergoing End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Iron supplement and especially Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) have become the treatment of choice for that anemia. However, it is very complicated to find an adequate treatment for every patient in each particular situation since dosage guidelines are based on average behaviors, and thus, they do not take into account the particular response to those drugs by different patients, although that response may vary enormously from one patient to another and even for the same patient in different stages of the anemia. This work proposes an advance with respect to previous works that have faced this problem using different methodologies (Machine Learning (ML), among others), since the diversity of the CKD population has been explicitly taken into account in order to produce a general and reliable model for the prediction of ESA/Iron therapy response. Furthermore, the ML model makes use of both human physiology and drug pharmacology to produce a model that outperforms previous approaches, yielding Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of the Hemoglobin (Hb) prediction around or lower than 0.6 g/dl in the three countries analyzed in the study, namely, Spain, Italy and Portugal.","2015","Computers in biology and medicine",,"Cohort",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Shinozaki Y. et al.","Anemia with inflammation-induced defective iron utilization is a pathological condition observed in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) or chronic inflammatory disease. There is no reasonable treatment for these conditions, because the effects of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) or iron supplementation in the treatment of anemia are insufficient. JTZ-951 (enarodustat) has been characterized as a novel, orally bioavailable inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH), and has been developed as a novel therapeutic agent for anemia with CKD. In this study, the effects of JTZ-951 on iron utilization during erythropoiesis and on anemia of inflammation were compared with those of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) using normal rat and rat model of anemia of inflammation. In normal rats, under conditions in which JTZ-951 and rHuEPO showed similar erythropoietic effect, repeated doses of JTZ-951 induced erythropoiesis while retaining the hemoglobin content in red blood cells, while administration of rHuEPO resulted in decrease in some erythrocyte-related parameters. As for iron-related parameters during erythropoiesis, JTZ-951 exhibited more efficient iron utilization compared to rHuEPO. A single dose of JTZ-951 resulted in decrease in hepcidin expression observed within 24 h after administration, but a single dose of rHuEPO did not. In a rat model of anemia of inflammation (also known as a model with functional iron-deficiency), JTZ-951 showed erythropoietic effect, in contrast with rHuEPO. These results suggest that, unlike rHuEPO, JTZ-951 stimulates erythropoiesis by increasing iron utilization, and improves anemia of inflammation.","2021","European journal of pharmacology",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Farrington D. et al.","RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Anemia is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD); although anemia is associated with adverse outcomes, the available treatments are not ideal. We characterized the burden, risk factors for, and risks associated with anemia by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hemoglobin level. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional and prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Outpatient data from 5,004,957 individuals across 57 health care centers in the United States from 2016 to 2019, extracted from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse. EXPOSURE: Severity of anemia, presence of low iron test results, eGFR. OUTCOME: Incident kidney failure with replacement therapy, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, death. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The prevalences of anemia, low iron test results, vitamin B(12) deficiency, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) use, stratified by sex and eGFR, were characterized. Polychotomous logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios of different hemoglobin levels across eGFR. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios for adverse outcomes across hemoglobin level. RESULTS: The mean age was 54 years, and 42% were male. Lower eGFR was very strongly associated with increased prevalence of anemia, even after adjustment. Although iron studies were checked infrequently in patients with anemia, low iron test results were highly prevalent in those tested: 60.4% and 81.3% of men and women, respectively. ESA use was uncommon, with a prevalence of use of<4%. Lower hemoglobin was independently associated with increased risk of incident kidney failure with replacement therapy, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and death. LIMITATIONS: Reliance on ICD codes for medical diagnoses, death information obtained from claims data, observational study. CONCLUSIONS: Severe anemia was common and strongly associated with lower eGFR and multiple adverse outcomes.

","Hara K. et al.","OBJECTIVE: A low serum adiponectin level is associated with a high incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the healthy population. Paradoxically, serum adiponectin is elevated in patients with severe CAD or chronic heart failure. We investigated the determinants of serum high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin in patients with CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 228 consecutive patients with CAD confirmed by angiography. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin of <13.0 g/dL in men and<12.0 g/dL in women. A high plasma B-type natriuretic-peptide (BNP) was defined as >100 pg/mL. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 mL/min for more than 3 months. The patients with CAD were divided into eight groups according to the presence or absence of anemia, high BNP, and/or CKD. RESULTS: In all 228 patients with CAD, serum HMW adiponectin correlated positively with age, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and BNP, while this parameter showed negative correlations with body mass index, insulin resistance, triglycerides, eGFR, and hemoglobin. Multivariate analysis showed that HDL-C, BNP, gender, and age were independently associated with the HMW adiponectin. Serum HMW adiponectin was lower in CAD patients with than without metabolic syndrome. Serum HMW adiponectin and the HMW/total adiponectin ratio were highest in CAD patients who had anemia, high BNP, and CKD among the groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with CAD, metabolic syndrome is associated with a lower serum HMW adiponectin, while the presence of anemia, high BNP, and CKD is associated with elevation of the serum HMW adiponectin.","2011","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)"," OBJECTIVE : A low serum adiponectin level is associated with a high incidence of coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in the healthy population ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Guedes M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Approximately 30%-45% of patients with nondialysis CKD have iron deficiency. Iron therapy in CKD has focused primarily on supporting erythropoiesis. In patients with or without anemia, there has not been a comprehensive approach to estimating the association between serum biomarkers of iron stores, and mortality and cardiovascular event risks. METHODS: The study included 5145 patients from Brazil, France, the United States, and Germany enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, with first available transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin levels as exposure variables. We used Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with progressive adjustment for potentially confounding variables. We also used linear spline models to further evaluate functional forms of the exposure-outcome associations. RESULTS: Compared with patients with a TSAT of 26%-35%, those with a TSAT ≤15% had the highest adjusted risks for all-cause mortality and MACE. Spline analysis found the lowest risk at TSAT 40% for all-cause mortality and MACE. Risk of all-cause mortality, but not MACE, was also elevated at TSAT ≥46%. Effect estimates were similar after adjustment for hemoglobin. For ferritin, no directional associations were apparent, except for elevated all-cause mortality at ferritin ≥300 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency, as captured by TSAT, is associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality and MACE in patients with nondialysis CKD, with or without anemia. Interventional studies evaluating the effect on clinical outcomes of iron supplementation and therapies for alternative targets are needed to better inform strategies for administering exogenous iron.","2021","Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

Here we report data from a study of anemic pre-dialysis patients to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of HX575 vs. Erypo®/Eprex® (Ortho Biotech, Neuss, Germany). METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind study in adult patients (n = 337) with Stage III - V CKD and a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.5 - 11.0 g/dl. Eligible patients were randomized to 52 weeks of treatment with HX575 or Erypo®/Eprex® at a starting dose of 25 IU/kg body weight 3 times weekly or 75 IU/kg body weight once weekly during Weeks 1 - 5. This could be adjusted after 5 weeks to maintain Hb levels between 10 and 12 g/dl. The primary objective was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of HX575 compared with Erypo®/Eprex®. Efficacy endpoints were mean absolute change in Hb from baseline to end of Week 13 and mean weekly epoetin dosage in Weeks 11 - 13. RESULTS: HX575 was equivalent to Erypo®/Eprex® in terms of maintaining Hb levels and epoetin dose requirements. Two patients in the HX575 group developed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to erythropoietin, which resulted in the study being terminated prematurely. Aside from these two events, reported adverse events were as expected for patients with Stage III - V CKD and similar in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy and therapeutic equivalence of s.c. HX575 compared with the reference epoetin-α, but 2 patients developed NAbs during treatment with s.c.

","Majernikova M. et al.","PURPOSE: Anemia is a predictor of mortality and of self-rated health (SRH). However, studies on the relationship between SRH and changes in hemoglobin (Hb) value over time stratified by chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages are lacking. The aim is to explore whether a change in Hb-value over time associates with SRH at up to 8-year follow-up, stratified for CKD stages. METHODS: A prospective study with a baseline measurement between the 3rd and 12th month after KT was performed on 337 consecutive patients. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from medical records. CKD stages were estimated using the CKD-EPI formula and divided into two groups: CKD1-2 and CKD3-5. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were performed to identify associations of SRH at follow-up in both CKD groups. RESULTS: Male gender, new-onset diabetes mellitus after KT (NODAT), a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Hb-value over time contributed significantly to the GEE model on SRH at follow-up in CKD1-2. For SRH at follow-up in CKD3-5, older age, male gender and chronic renal allograft dysfunction (CRAD) contributed significantly to the GEE model. CONCLUSIONS: At up to 8-year follow-up, male gender, NODAT, a decrease in eGFR and Hb-value over time are associated with poorer SRH in CKD1-2. In such patients, we suggest monitoring slight deteriorations in eGFR and Hb-values. In CKD3-5, higher age, male gender and higher presence of CRAD are associated with poorer SRH at up to 8-year follow-up. In these patients, adequate treatment would slow down CRAD progression.","2016","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation"," PURPOSE : Anemia is a predictor of mortality and of self-rated health ( SRH ) ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

The presence of CKD and anemia showed a positive interaction on physical functioning outcomes. Among participants with CKD, physical functioning was worse in patients with anemia compared with those without anemia. BACKGROUND: CKD is a major public health problem worldwide. Anemia, a frequent and treatable complication of CKD, is associated with decreased physical functioning and physical activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the joint association of CKD and anemia with physical functioning and physical activity in a representative sample of the US population. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2016 for physical functioning outcomes (N=33,300) and NHANES 2007–2016 for physical activity (N=22,933). The NHANES physical functioning questionnaire included 19 items. The NHANES physical activity questionnaire captured work-related, leisure-time, and sedentary activities. Higher physical functioning scores represent worse function. CKD was classified using Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 2002 criteria, and anemia was defined using the World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: The adjusted mean differences (95% confidence interval) in overall physical functioning score comparing participants with anemia with those without anemia among participants with no CKD, CKD stages 1–2, and stages 3–5 were 0.5 (−0.1 to 1.0), 1.5 (0.2 to 2.8), and 3.6 (2.0 to 5.2). Anemia and CKD showed a supra-additive interaction for all physical functioning outcomes among participants in CKD stages 3–5. The prevalence of high physical activity was also lower in participants with anemia compared with those without anemia among participants in CKD stages 3–5 (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 1.01).

ESA users switched to daprodustat 4 mg once daily. CERA was started at 25 μg every 2 weeks for ESA-naïve patients and 25-250 μg every 4 weeks for ESA users based on previous ESA dose. In both treatment groups, dose was adjusted every 4 weeks based on hemoglobin level and changed according to a prespecified algorithm. The primary endpoint was mean hemoglobin level during weeks 40-52 in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The 145 patients with nondialysis CKD and hemoglobin ≤10.5 g/dl were randomized into one of six cohorts of approximately 24 patients each with varying roxadustat starting doses (tiered weight and fixed amounts) and frequencies (two and three times weekly) followed by hemoglobin maintenance with roxadustat one to three times weekly. Treatment duration was 16 or 24 weeks. Intravenous iron was prohibited. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving hemoglobin increase of ≥1.0 g/dl from baseline and hemoglobin of ≥11.0 g/dl by week 17 (16 weeks of treatment). Secondary analyses included mean hemoglobin change from baseline, iron utilization, and serum lipids. Safety was evaluated by frequency/severity of adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 145 patients enrolled, 143 were evaluable for efficacy. Overall, 92% of patients achieved hemoglobin response. Higher compared with lower starting doses led to earlier achievement of hemoglobin response. Roxadustat-induced hemoglobin increases were independent of baseline C-reactive protein levels and iron repletion status. Overall, over the first 16 treatment weeks, hepcidin levels decreased by 16.9% (P=0.004), reticulocyte hemoglobin content was maintained, and hemoglobin increased by a mean (±SD) of 1.83 (±0.09) g/dl (P<0.001). Overall mean total cholesterol level was reduced by a mean (±SD) of 26 (±30) mg/dl (P<0.001) after 8 weeks of therapy, independent of the use of statins or other lipid-lowering agents. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with nondialysis CKD who were anemic, various starting dose regimens of roxadustat were well tolerated and achieved anemia correction with reduced serum hepcidin levels.

Searches included PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library database up to October 2019. RCTs of patients with CKD comparing HIF-PHIs with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or placebo in the treatment of anemia. The primary outcome was hemoglobin change from baseline (Hb CFB); the secondary outcomes included iron-related parameters and the occurrence of each adverse event. 26 trials in 17 articles were included, with a total of 2804 dialysis or patients with CKD. HIF-PHIs treatment produced a significant beneficial effect on Hb CFB compared with the placebo group (MD, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.02). However, this favored effect of HIF-PHIs treatment was not observed in subgroup analysis among trials compared with ESAs (MD, 0.06; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.31). The significant reduction in hepcidin by HIF-PHIs was observed in all subgroups when compared with the placebo group, whereas this effect was observed only in NDD-CKD patients when compared with ESAs.

","Zuk A. et al.","Pharmacological inhibition of prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors that activate target genes that, among others, increase erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis, resulting in the production of new red blood cells (RBCs). Herein, we summarize the preclinical characteristics of the small molecule HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor vadadustat (AKB-6548), which is in development for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vadadustat inhibits the enzyme activity of all three human PHD isozymes, PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, with similar low nanomolar inhibitory constant values. PHD enzyme inhibition by vadadustat is competitive with endogenous cofactor 2-oxoglutarate and is insensitive to free iron concentration. In the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep 3B) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, PHD inhibition by vadadustat leads to the time- and concentration-dependent stabilization of HIF-1α and HIF-2α In Hep 3B cells, this in turn results in the synthesis and secretion of EPO; vascular endothelial growth factor is not measured at detectable levels. A single oral dose of vadadustat in rats potently increases circulating levels of EPO, and daily oral dosing for 14 days increases RBC indices in healthy rats and in the 5/6 nephrectomy model of CKD. In mice and dogs, once-daily repeat oral dosing increases hemoglobin and hematocrit. Vadadustat has a relatively short half-life in all nonclinical species evaluated and does not accumulate when administered as a single bolus dose (oral or intravenous) or upon repeat oral dosing. The pharmacological profile of vadadustat supports continued development for treatment of renal anemia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Vadadustat (AKB-6548) is an orally bioavailable small molecule prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor in development for anemia of chronic kidney disease. It is an equipotent inhibitor of the three human prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain isoforms, which activates erythropoiesis through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α, increasing production of erythropoietin, without detectable stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor.","2022","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics",,"other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

METHODS: In the NDD study, 91 participants were randomized to low (1.1-1.75 mg/kg) or high (1.50-2.25 mg/kg) FG-4592 starting doses or to placebo. In the DD study, 87 were enrolled to low (1.1-1.8 mg/kg), medium (1.5-2.3 mg/kg) and high (1.7-2.3 mg/kg) starting FG-4592 doses or to continuation of epoetin alfa. In both studies, only oral iron supplementation was allowed. RESULTS: In the NDD study, hemoglobin (Hb) increase ≥1 g/dL from baseline was achieved in 80.0% of subjects in the low-dose cohort and 87.1% in the high-dose cohort, versus 23.3% in the placebo arm (P < 0.0001, both).

In both studies, significant reductions in cholesterol were noted in FG-4592-treated subjects, with stability or increases in serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin (without intravenous iron administration). In the NDD study, hepcidin levels were significantly reduced across all FG-4592-treated arms as compared with no change in the placebo arm. In the DD study, hepcidin levels were also reduced in a statistically significant dose-dependent manner in the highest dose group as compared with the epoetin alfa-treated group.

Target hemoglobin (Hb) levels for CKD treatment remain controversial: Recent guidelines recommend a maximum of 13 g/dL to avoid increased risk of CVD. However, some smaller studies show slower progression of renal function loss with high Hb targets. Recently, darbepoetin alfa targeting Hb 11-13 g/dL was reported to improve renal composite outcome of Japanese patients compared with a low Hb group maintained at 9.0-11.0 g/dL using epoetin alfa (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.47-0.93). The high Hb group showed significant reduction of left ventricular mass index and improved quality of life. Sub-analysis revealed greater beneficial effects in non-diabetic stage 5 CKD patients. This randomized controlled trial, PREDICT, aims to confirm the impact of targeting Hb levels of 11-13 g/dL using darbepoetin alfa with reference to a low Hb target of 9-11 g/dL. METHODS: We calculated the number of subjects (N = 440) necessary to detect a statistically significant level of α = 0.05 (two-sided) and statistical power of 80% for a minimum follow-up period of 2 years on the basis of a previous study. RESULTS: The study enrolled 498 non-diabetic Japanese patients with eGFR 8-20 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

","Liu J. et al.","We have previously demonstrated that the Na-K-ATPase signaling-mediated oxidant amplification loop contributes to experimental uremic cardiomyopathy and anemia induced by 5/6th partial nephrectomy (PNx). This process can be ameliorated by systemic administration of the peptide pNaKtide, which was designed to block this oxidant amplification loop. The present study demonstrated that the PNx-induced anemia is characterized by marked decreases in red blood cell (RBC) survival as assessed by biotinylated RBC clearance and eryptosis as assessed by annexin V binding. No significant change in iron homeostasis was observed. Examination of plasma samples demonstrated that PNx induced significant increases in systemic oxidant stress as assessed by protein carbonylation, plasma erythropoietin concentration, and blood urea nitrogen. Systemic administration of pNaKtide, but not NaKtide (pNaKtide without the TAT leader sequence) and a scramble ""pNaKtide"" (sc-pNaKtide), led to the normalization of hematocrit, RBC survival, and plasma protein carbonylation. Administration of the three peptides had no significant effect on PNx-induced increases in plasma erythropoietin and blood urea nitrogen without notable changes in iron metabolism. These data indicate that blockage of the Na-K-ATPase signaling-mediated oxidant amplification loop ameliorates the anemia of experimental renal failure by increasing RBC survival.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The anemia of CKD is multifactorial, and the current treatment based primarily on stimulating bone marrow production of RBCs with erythropoietin or erythropoietin analogs is unsatisfactory. In a murine model of CKD that is complicated by anemia, blockade of Na-K-ATPase signaling with a specific peptide (pNaKtide) ameliorated the anemia primarily by increasing RBC survival. Should these results be confirmed in patients, this strategy may allow for novel and potentially additive strategies to treat the anemia of CKD.","2022","American journal of physiology.

This study was aimed at examining the association of HbA1c variability with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the large cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes from the Renal Insufficiency and Cardiovascular Events (RIACE) Italian Multicenter Study. METHODS: Serial (3-5) HbA1c values obtained during the 2-year period preceding recruitment, including that obtained at the enrolment, were available from 8,290 subjects from 9 centers (out of 15,773 patients from 19 centers). Average HbA1c and HbA1c variability were calculated as the intra-individual mean (HbA1c-MEAN) and standard deviation (HbA1c-SD), respectively, of 4.52 ± 0.76 values. Prevalent CVD, total and by vascular bed, was assessed from medical history by recording previous documented major acute events. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was assessed by dilated fundoscopy. CKD was defined based on albuminuria, as measured by immunonephelometry or immunoturbidimetry, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, as calculated from serum creatinine. RESULTS: HbA1c-MEAN, but not HbA1c-SD, was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in subjects with history of any CVD (n. 2,133, 25.7%) than in those without CVD (n. 6,157, 74.3%). Median and interquartile range were 7.78 (7.04-8.56) and 7.49 (6.81-8.31), respectively, for HbA1c-MEAN, and 0.47 (0.29-0.75) and 0.46 (0.28-0.73), respectively, for HbA1c-SD. Logistic regression analyses showed that HbA1c-MEAN, but not HbA1c-SD (and independent of it), was a significant correlate of any CVD. Similar findings were observed in subjects with versus those without any coronary or cerebrovascular event or myocardial infarction. Conversely, none of these measures were associated with stroke, whereas both correlated with any lower limb vascular event and HbA1c-SD alone with ulceration/gangrene. All these associations were independent of known CVD risk factors and microvascular complications (DR and CKD).

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients on hemodialysis with a baseline hemoglobin of 8-11.5 g/dl receiving an ESA were randomized 2:1 to daprodustat three times weekly (n=270) or conventional epoetin (n=137) for 52 weeks. Dosing algorithms aimed to maintain hemoglobin between 10 and 11 g/dl. The primary end point was mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to the average during the evaluation period (weeks 28-52). The principal secondary end point was average monthly intravenous iron dose. Other secondary end points included BP and hemoglobin variability. RESULTS: Daprodustat three times weekly was noninferior to epoetin for mean change in hemoglobin (model-adjusted mean treatment difference [daprodustat-epoetin], -0.05; 95% confidence interval, -0.21 to 0.10). During the evaluation period, mean (SD) hemoglobin values were 10.45 (0.55) and 10.51 (0.85) g/dl for daprodustat and epoetin groups, respectively. Responders (defined as mean hemoglobin during the evaluation period in the analysis range of 10 to 11.5 g/dl) were 80% in the daprodustat group versus 64% in the epoetin group. Proportionately fewer participants in the daprodustat group versus the epoetin group had hemoglobin values either below 10 g/dl or above 11.5 g/dl during the evaluation period. Mean monthly intravenous iron use was not significantly lower with daprodustat versus epoetin. The effect on BP was similar between groups. The percentage of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between daprodustat (75%) and epoetin (79%). CONCLUSIONS: Daprodustat was noninferior to epoetin in hemoglobin response and was generally well tolerated.

We compared anemia prevalence and characteristics in the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004 populations. METHODS: Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were collected from August 2000 to December 31, 2006, from participants in KEEP, a community-based health-screening program targeting individuals 18 years and older with diabetes, hypertension, or family history of kidney disease, diabetes, or hypertension. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin level less than 13.5 g/dL for men and less than 12.0 g/dL for women (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative [KDOQI] 2006) or less than 13.0 g/dL for men and less than 12.0 g/dL for women (World Health Organization [WHO]). RESULTS: In KEEP (n = 70,069), 68.3% of participants, and in NHANES (n = 17,061), 52% of participants, were women. African Americans represented 33.9% of the KEEP and 11.2% of the NHANES cohorts, and Hispanics comprised 12.4% of KEEP and 13.2% of NHANES. Using the KDOQI classification, anemia was present in 13.9% and 6.3% of KEEP and NHANES participants, whereas using the WHO classification, anemia was present in 11.8% and 5.3%, respectively. In adjusted analysis of KEEP data, KDOQI-defined anemia was significantly more likely in men (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 1.37); this pattern was reversed when using WHO-defined anemia (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.72). Adjusted odds of anemia were greater for African American than white KEEP participants (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.80 to 3.16; OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.81 to 3.20 for KDOQI- and WHO-defined anemia, respectively). CONCLUSION: Anemia was twice as common in the targeted KEEP chronic kidney disease screening program cohort than in the NHANES sample population.

","Csiky B. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Roxadustat is an orally administered hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This European, phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study investigated efficacy and safety of roxadustat in patients with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis for at least 4 months. METHODS: Patients were randomized to switch from an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) (epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa) to roxadustat three times/week or to continue their previous ESA. Roxadustat and ESA doses were adjusted to maintain hemoglobin within 10.0-12.0 g/dL during the treatment period (day 1 up to 52-104 weeks). Primary endpoints were hemoglobin change from baseline (CFB) to the average of weeks 28-36 without rescue therapy and hemoglobin CFB to the average of weeks 28-52 regardless of rescue therapy. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed descriptively. RESULTS: Of 1081 screened patients, 836 were randomized and received treatment (roxadustat, n = 415; ESA, n = 421). The least squares means (95% CI) of the treatment difference (roxadustat - ESA) for hemoglobin CFB to weeks 28-36 (without rescue therapy) and CFB to weeks 28-52 (regardless of rescue therapy) were 0.235 (0.132, 0.339) g/dL and 0.171 (0.082, 0.261) g/dL, respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority of roxadustat to ESA (non-inferiority margin of - 0.75 g/dL). The proportions of patients who achieved target hemoglobin without rescue therapy during weeks 28-36 were 84.2% (roxadustat) and 82.4% (ESA). Roxadustat was superior to ESA in decreasing LDL cholesterol from baseline to the average of weeks 12-28. Serious TEAEs occurred in 50.7% (roxadustat) and 45.0% (ESA) of patients. Common TEAEs in both treatment groups included hypertension, arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, headache, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Roxadustat was non-inferior to ESAs in maintaining hemoglobin levels in this cohort of patients with anemia of CKD on dialysis for at least 4 months who were previously treated with ESAs.

","Wu J. et al.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), low serum albumin, and anemia are known risk factors for cognitive decline in older people. We investigated the association between kidney function and cognitive impairment severity in oldest-old people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients aged 80 years and older was conducted at a veterans' home in Taiwan between 2012 and 2016. Their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Diseases (MDRD) equation. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (age mean ± SD, 86.6 ± 3.9 years) had MMSE scores of 10.1 ± 6.7, and CDR scores of 1.6 ± 0.7. The average eGFR was 61.7 ± 21.5 mL/min/1.73m(2). The mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.7 ± 1.7 g/dl, and the mean albumin concentration was 4.5 ± 4.8 g/dl. Multivariate regression analyses showed that scores of CDR were significantly correlated with eGFR after adjustment for potential confounders. The scores of MMSE were significantly correlated with serum albumin and hemoglobin after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We found dementia severity was significantly associated with kidney function, serum albumin, and hemoglobin in the oldest-old with AD. We recommend that oldest-old people with a diagnosis of AD be evaluated to determine kidney function, as well as nutritional and hematological status. Further study is needed to establish whether prevention of CKD deterioration, and correction of malnutrition and anemia may help to slow cognitive decline in oldest-old people with dementia.","2020","BMC geriatrics"," We investigated the association between kidney function and cognitive impairment severity in oldest-old people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) ","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"

","Pergola P. et al.","BACKGROUND: Patients with CKD who are on hemodialysis are hyporesponsive to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) because of anemia of inflammation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced hepcidin expression is a key mediator of such inflammation. METHODS: This phase 1/2, placebo-controlled trial assessed effects of ziltivekimab, a novel anti-IL-6 ligand antibody, in patients on hemodialysis with rs855791, a single nucleotide polymorphism of the TMPRSS6 gene that is hypothesized to heighten susceptibility to IL-6-mediated inflammatory effects. After a screening period documenting stable ESA and iron dosing, we randomized 61 patients with elevated IL-6 (≥4 pg/ml) to receive placebo or ziltivekimab (doses of 2, 6, or 20 mg), administered intravenously every 2 weeks for 12 weeks during hemodialysis. ESA dose adjustments were allowed after 4 weeks. We analyzed safety and effects on inflammation, iron metabolism, serum albumin, and anti-drug antibodies. RESULTS: No patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity. Four patients (two each in the 6- and 20-mg cohorts) died of a treatment-emergent adverse event. Compared with patients receiving placebo, those receiving ziltivekimab experienced significantly greater reductions of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and fibrinogen from baseline to end of treatment. Median ESA usage decreased by 15,000, 15,000, or 33,000 IU/wk per patient in the 2-, 6-, and 20-mg ziltivekimab cohorts, respectively, compared with no change in the placebo group. We also noted significant dose responses for decreased ESA resistance index and increased serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and serum albumin. CONCLUSIONS: Ziltivekimab significantly improved markers of inflammation, reduced ESA requirements, and increased serum albumin in patients on hemodialysis with inflammation and hyporesponsiveness to ESA therapy.

","Provenzano R. et al.","BACKGROUND: Roxadustat (FG-4592) is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor that promotes erythropoiesis through increasing endogenous erythropoietin, improving iron regulation, and reducing hepcidin. STUDY DESIGN: Phase 2, randomized (3:1), open-label, active-comparator, safety and efficacy study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients with stable end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis who previously had hemoglobin (Hb) levels maintained with epoetin alfa. INTERVENTION: Part 1: 6-week dose-ranging study in 54 individuals of thrice-weekly oral roxadustat doses versus continuation of intravenous epoetin alfa. Part 2: 19-week treatment in 90 individuals in 6 cohorts with various starting doses and adjustment rules (1.0-2.0mg/kg or tiered weight based) in individuals with a range of epoetin alfa responsiveness. Intravenous iron was prohibited. OUTCOMES: Primary end point was Hb level response, defined as end-of-treatment Hb level change (ΔHb) of -0.5g/dL or greater from baseline (part 1) and as mean Hb level ≥ 11.0g/dL during the last 4 treatment weeks (part 2). MEASUREMENTS: Hepcidin, iron parameters, cholesterol, and plasma erythropoietin (the latter in a subset). RESULTS: Baseline epoetin alfa doses were 138.3±51.3 (SD) and 136.3±47.7U/kg/wk in part 1 and 152.8±80.6 and 173.4±83.7U/kg/wk in part 2, in individuals randomly assigned to roxadustat and epoetin alfa, respectively. Hb level responder rates in part 1 were 79% in pooled roxadustat 1.5 to 2.0mg/kg compared to 33% in the epoetin alfa control arm (P=0.03). Hepcidin level reduction was greater at roxadustat 2.0mg/kg versus epoetin alfa (P<0.05). In part 2, the average roxadustat dose requirement for Hb level maintenance was ∼1.7mg/kg. The least-squares-mean ΔHb in roxadustat-treated individuals was comparable to that in epoetin alfa-treated individuals (about -0.5g/dL) and the least-squares-mean difference in ΔHb between both treatment arms was -0.03 (95% CI, -0.39 to 0.33) g/dL (mixed effect model-repeated measure).

","Chen N. et al.","BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that mainly regulates erythropoiesis. In patients with chronic renal failure with anemia, darbepoetin alfa can stimulate erythropoiesis, correct anemia, and maintain hemoglobin levels. This study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa injections as being not inferior to epoetin alfa injections (Recombinant Human Erythropoietin injection, rHuEPO) when maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) levels within the target range (10.0-12.0 g/dL) for the treatment of renal anemia. METHODS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled in this study from April 15, 2013 to April 10, 2014 at 25 sites. In this study, patients (n = 95) aged 18-70 years were randomized into a once per week intravenous darbepoetin alfa group (n = 56) and a twice or three times per week intravenous epoetin alfa group (n = 39) for 28 weeks, who had anemia with hemoglobin levels between 6 g/dL and 10 g/dL due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and were undergoing hemodialysis or hemofiltration with ESA-naive (erythropoiesis stimulating agent-naive). The primary efficacy profile was the mean Hb level (the non-inferiority margin was -1.0 g/dL, week 21-28); the secondary efficacy profiles were the Hb increase rate (week 0-4), the target Hb achievement cumulative rate and time, the change trends of the Hb levels, and the target Hb maintenance ratio. Adverse events (AEs) were observed and compared, and the efficacy and safety were analyzed between the two treatment groups. Additionally, the frequencies of dose adjustments between the darbepoetin alfa and epoetin alfa groups were compared during the treatment period. SAS® software version 9.2 was used to perform all statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were used for all efficacy, safety, and demographic variable analyses, including for the primary efficacy indicators. RESULTS: The mean Hb level was 11.3 g/dL in the darbepoetin alfa group and 10.7 g/dL in the epoetin alfa group, respectively; the difference of the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals (CI) between the two groups was 0.1 g/dL (>-1.0 g/dL), and non-inferiority was proven; the Hb levels started to increase in the first four weeks at a similar increase rate; no obvious differences were observed between the groups in the target Hb achievement cumulative rates, and the Hb levels as well as the target Hb level maintenance rate changed over time. The incidence of AEs was 62.5% in the darbepoetin alfa group and 76.9% in the epoetin alfa group. All the adverse events observed in the study were those commonly associated with hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Darbepoetin alfa intravenously once per week can effectively increase Hb levels and maintain the target Hb levels well, which makes it not inferior to epoetin alfa intravenously twice or three times per week. Darbepoetin alfa shows an efficacy and safety comparable to epoetin alfa for the treatment of renal anemia.","2022","Chronic diseases and translational medicine"," This study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa injections as being not inferior to epoetin alfa injections ( Recombinant Human Erythropoietin injection , rHuEPO ) when maintaining hemoglobin ( Hb ) levels within the target range ( 10","other",1,"anemiaHbIronCkdLisa","2023-11-08"
