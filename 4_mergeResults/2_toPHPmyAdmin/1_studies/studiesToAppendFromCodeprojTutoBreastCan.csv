,"38261460","Pattern and trend of cancer in Saurashtra region in Gujarat state of India, a hospital-based study.","Saini SK","BACKGROUND: Cancer is growing concern for every country. Reliable data is a source to define the magnitude of the problem, which then helps to plan for necessary action. This epidemiological study involves the collection and analysis of hospital registry data to assess the quantum of the problem of cancer over a five-year period from 2012-16 and to plan priority action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital-based data for five years from 2012-2016 was retrieved from the department of radiotherapy at M. P. Shah Government Medical College, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, and analysed to define the magnitude of the problem. All data was studied using Microsoft Excel 2016.
RESULTS: A total of 7355 patients were registered between 2012 and 2016, out of which 62 percent were male. Cancers of the cervix and uterus were discernibly less common in the Saurashtra region and accounted for only 12.37% of all cancers in females. Lung cancer was the leading cancer as a single site in males (24.13% of all cancers in males) and breast cancer in females (37.36% of all cancers in females). Head and neck cancer, all sites clubbed, was most common in males (42%). Jamnagar taluka represented around 50% of all cases at the study center.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco-related cancers were most common in the male population, and stringent implementation of a national tobacco control program is the most appropriate measure to curtail incidences and hence mortality in this male population. Non-modifiable risk factors like gender-related cancer were more common in the female population, and resource-appropriate screening is a suitable option for these diseases. A population-based cancer registry is required to further define the pattern pertinently, or an epidemiological study is required to find causes of the noticeably lower incidence of cancer of the cervix,.","2024",,"J Cancer Res Ther",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"38200428","Polygenic risk score model for renal cell carcinoma in the Korean population and relationship with lifestyle-associated factors.","Hong JY","BACKGROUND: The polygenic risk score (PRS) is used to predict the risk of developing common complex diseases or cancers using genetic markers. Although PRS is used in clinical practice to predict breast cancer risk, it is more accurate for Europeans than for non-Europeans because of the sample size of training genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To address this disparity, we constructed a PRS model for predicting the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the Korean population.
RESULTS: Using GWAS analysis, we identified 43 Korean-specific variants and calculated the PRS. Subsequent to plotting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we selected the 31 best-performing variants to construct an optimal PRS model. The resultant PRS model with 31 variants demonstrated a prediction rate of 77.4%. The pathway analysis indicated that the identified non-coding variants are involved in regulating the expression of genes related to cancer initiation and progression. Notably, favorable lifestyle habits, such as avoiding tobacco and alcohol, mitigated the risk of RCC across PRS strata expressing genetic risk.
CONCLUSION: A Korean-specific PRS model was established to predict the risk of RCC in the underrepresented Korean population. Our findings suggest that lifestyle-associated factors influencing RCC risk are associated with acquired risk factors indirectly through epigenetic modification, even among individuals in the higher PRS category.","2024",,"BMC Genomics",,"other","Humans, FALSE, Carcinoma, Renal Cell, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Genetic Risk Score, FALSE, Genome-Wide Association Study, FALSE, Life Style, FALSE, Kidney Neoplasms, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Republic of Korea, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We comprehensively reviewed the literature published by July 2022 concerning the adverse impacts of SHS exposure on nine health outcomes. Following, we quantified each exposure-response association accounting for various sources of uncertainty and evaluated the strength of the evidence supporting our analyses using the Burden of Proof Risk Function methodology. We found all nine health outcomes to be associated with SHS exposure. We conservatively estimated that SHS increases the risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and lung cancer by at least around 8%, 5%, 1% and 1%, respectively, with the evidence supporting these harmful associations rated as weak (two stars). The evidence supporting the harmful associations between SHS and otitis media, asthma, lower respiratory infections, breast cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was weaker (one star). Despite the weak underlying evidence for these associations, our results reinforce the harmful effects of SHS on health and the need to prioritize advancing efforts to reduce active and passive smoking through a combination of public health policies and education initiatives.","2024",,"Nat Med",,"other","Child, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, TRUE, Asthma, TRUE, Respiratory Tract Infections, TRUE, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

,"38184557","The global, regional, and national disease burden of breast cancer attributable to tobacco from 1990 to 2019: a global burden of disease study.","Guo Q","OBJECTIVE: Tobacco has been identified as a significant contributory element to the development of breast cancer. Our objective was to evaluate the spatiotemporal trends of tobacco-related breast cancer at the global, regional, and national scales during 1990-2019.
METHODS: We extracted data on mortality, disability adjusted of life years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was computed to assess the temporal change in ASDR and ASMR.
RESULTS: In 2019, the deaths and DALYs attributed to tobacco-related breast cancer were estimated to be 35,439 (95% UI: 22,179-48,119) and 1,060,590 (95% UI: 622,550-1,462,580), respectively. These figures accounted for 5.1% and 5.2% of the total burden of breast cancer. ASMR and ASDR increased in low SDI regions, remained stable in low-middle and middle SDI regions and declined in high and high-middle SDI regions. The burden of breast cancer attributable to tobacco varied notably among regions and nations. Oceania, Southern Latin America, and Central Europe were the GBD regions with the highest number of ASMR and DALYs. There was a positive relationship between age-standardized rate and SDI value in 2019 across 204 nations or territories. A negative association was observed between the EAPC in ASMR or ASDR and the human development index (HDI) in 2019 (R = -0.55, p < 0.01 for ASMR; R = -0.56, p < 0.01 for ASDR).
CONCLUSION: Tobacco is one important and modifiable risk factor for breast cancer. The heterogeneity in both the spatial and temporal distribution can be attributed to factors such as aging, population growth, and SDI. These findings substantiate the necessity of expediting the enforcement of tobacco-free legislation in order to safeguard populations from the detrimental effects of tobacco.","2024",,"BMC Public Health"," OBJECTIVE : Tobacco has been identified as a significant contributory element to the development of breast cancer ","other","Humans, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Global Burden of Disease, FALSE, Nicotiana, FALSE, Cost of Illness, FALSE, Breast, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

To achieve an efficient level of protein production, codon sequences and expression cassette elements need to be optimized. However, the systematical expression of recombinant proteins in plant biomass can generally be controlled for the production of therapeutic proteins after the generation of transgenic plants. Without understanding the transgene expression patterns in plant tissue, it is difficult to enhance further production levels.

METHODS: A case-control (matched by age group and sex) study was conducted on regional cancer. Data on exposure factors and first-/second-degree family history of cancer (1/2FHC) were collected. The MGPT was performed using Illumina next-generation sequencing technology.
RESULTS: A total of 1,007 cases and 1,007 controls were included. The most frequent cancers were BC (n = 311), CCR (n = 147), prostate (n = 132), and lung cancers (n = 89). It was independently associated with cancer, 1/2FHC, tobacco consumption (TC), pesticide exposure (PE), solvent/glue exposure, and BMI <24. BC was associated with 1/2FHC, TC, and hormone replacement therapy use; CCR with 1/2FHC, TC, and BMI <24; prostate cancer with 1/2FHC, TC, and alcohol consumption; and lung cancer with 1/2FHC, TC, PE, and BMI <24. MGPT identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in 24 (32%) women with BC and in three (18%) women and four (24%) men diagnosed with CCR at under 50 years. Among the tested patients under 50 years with diagnosed BC and CCR, 98.6% and 97% present criteria for HCS, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the association of several factors associated with BC, CCR, prostate, and lung cancers and reinforced the importance of evaluating FHC and genetic testing, especially for patients under 50 years with diagnosed BC or CCR. A better understanding of population-specific cancer risk factors builds on sustainable data for developing prevention strategies.

,"38034128","Smoking history and breast cancer risk by pathological subtype: MCC-Spain study.","Peñalver-Argüeso B","INTRODUCTION: The role of cigarette smoking on breast cancer risk remains controversial, due to its dual carcinogenic-antiestrogenic action.
METHODS: In the population-based multi-case-control study (MCC-Spain), we collected epidemiological and clinical information for 1733 breast cancer cases and 1903 controls, including smoking exposure. The association with breast cancer, overall, by pathological subtype and menopausal status, was assessed using logistic and multinomial regression models.
RESULTS: Smokers had higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer, particularly if they had smoked ≥30 years (AOR=1.75; 95% CI: 1.04-2.94), although most estimates did not achieve statistical significance. In contrast, among postmenopausal women, smoking was associated with lower risk of breast cancer, mainly in overweight and obese women. The strongest risk reductions were observed among postmenopausal women who had stopped smoking ≥10 years before cancer diagnosis, particularly for HER2+ tumors (AOR=0.28; 95% CI: 0.11-0.68); p for heterogeneity = 0.040). Also, those who had smoked <10 pack-years (AOR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.47-0.98) or 10-25 pack-years (AOR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.42-0.92) during their lifetime were at a reduced risk of all breast cancer subtypes (p for heterogeneity: 0.405 and 0.475, respectively); however, women who had smoked more than 25 pack-years showed no reduced risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Menopausal status plays a key role in the relationship between tobacco and breast cancer for all cancer subtypes. While smoking seems to increase the risk in premenopausal woman, it might be associated to lower risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women with excess weight.","2023",,"Tob Induc Dis",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"37967297","Psychological Outcomes in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors.","McGrady ME","The diagnosis of cancer during adolescent and young adulthood (AYA) may alter the development and psychological trajectory of survivors across their lifespan. The current review focuses broadly on emotional health, social functioning, health behaviors, and cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) among AYA survivors. Overall, AYA survivors appear to be at elevated risk of emotional distress symptoms, mood and anxiety disorders, suicide, and mental health care service utilization compared with individuals without a cancer history. Difficulties with social relationships and reduced achievement of expected social outcomes including educational attainment and employment have been reported. Despite risk for health-related morbidities, including subsequent neoplasms, many AYA survivors do not engage in health behaviors at the recommended levels for physical activity, diet, or tobacco and alcohol use. Although CRCI has not been comprehensively characterized in this population, subgroups of AYA survivors appear to be at risk for experiencing CRCI, including survivors of central nervous system tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular, and breast cancer. Across each considered domain of psychological functioning, intervention efforts have largely focused on acceptability and feasibility with an increasing focus on e/mHealth approaches. Future research should include multiphase studies, including randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate intervention efficacy and effectiveness. It is imperative that psychological interventions consider the unique needs of AYA survivors by developmental stage and across multiple levels of influence (patient, support system, institution, and health care system).","2023",,"J Clin Oncol",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

It is strongly recommended that oncology care providers provide cessation support; however, there is limited information about smoking cessation assessment and treatment patterns in routine oncology practice.
METHODS: Leaders of the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) and National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (National Accredited Program for Breast Cancer) elected to participate in a national quality improvement initiative (Just ASK) focused on smoking assessment/treatment in cancer care. Online baseline survey responses were received from 762 accredited programs.
RESULTS: Most programs reported regularly asking about smoking (89.9%), documenting smoking history and current use (85.8%), and advising patients to quit (71.2%). However, less than half of programs reported documenting a smoking cessation treatment plan (41.7%). Even fewer programs reported regularly assisting patients with quitting (41.3%), providing self-help information (27.2%), providing individual counseling (18.2%), and referring patients to an affiliated tobacco treatment program (26.1%) or external Quitline (28.5%). Very few programs reported regularly prescribing medications (17.6%). Principal barriers to tobacco treatment delivery were lack of staff training (68.8%), lack of designated specialists (61.9%), perceived patient resistance (58.3%), lack of available resources (53.3%), competing clinical priorities (50.9%), inadequate program funding (40.6%), insufficient staff time (42.4%), and inadequate reimbursement (31.0%).
CONCLUSION: Although programs reported a high rate of smoking assessment, critical gaps in advising and assisting patients with cessation were found.

A prospective analysis of breast cancer survivors and population-based controls.","Gali K","BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle factors are known to impact survival. It is less clear whether this differs between postmenopausal women ever diagnosed with breast cancer and unaffected women.
METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer and unaffected women of comparable age were recruited from 2002 to 2005 and followed up until 2020. Using baseline information, a lifestyle adherence score (range 0-8; categorized as low [0-3.74], moderate [3.75-4.74], and high [≥4.75]) was created based on the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) cancer prevention recommendations. Cox regression and competing risks analysis were used to analyze the association of adherence to WCRF/AICR lifestyle recommendations with overall mortality and with death due to cardiovascular diseases and cancer, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 8584 women were included (2785 with breast cancer and 5799 without). With a median follow-up of 16.1 years there were 2006 total deaths. Among the deaths of known causes (98.6%), 445 were cardiovascular-related and 1004 were cancer-related. The average lifestyle score was 4.2. There was no differential effect of lifestyle score by case-control status on mortality. After adjusting for covariates, moderate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.76) and high (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47-0.63) adherence to WCRF/AICR lifestyle recommendations were significantly associated with a decrease in overall mortality. Similarly, in competing risks analysis, moderate and high adherence were associated with decreased mortality from cardiovascular diseases and from cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: A healthy lifestyle can substantially reduce mortality risk in women. With low adherence to all WCRF/AICR guidelines in about a third of study participants, health interventions are warranted.","2023",,"Cancer",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"37857978","Ten reasons to screen women at risk of lung cancer.","Revel MP","This opinion piece reviews major reasons for promoting lung cancer screening in at-risk women who are smokers or ex-smokers, from the age of 50. The epidemiology of lung cancer in European women is extremely worrying, with lung cancer mortality expected to surpass breast cancer mortality in most European countries. There are conflicting data as to whether women are at increased risk of developing lung cancer compared to men who have a similar tobacco exposure. The sharp increase in the incidence of lung cancer in women exceeds the increase in their smoking exposure which is in favor of greater susceptibility. Lung and breast cancer screening could be carried out simultaneously, as the screening ages largely coincide. In addition, lung cancer screening could be carried out every 2 years, as is the case for breast cancer screening, if the baseline CT scan is negative.As well as detecting early curable lung cancer, screening can also detect coronary heart disease and osteoporosis induced by smoking. This enables preventive measures to be taken in addition to smoking cessation assistance, to reduce morbidity and mortality in the female population. Key points • The epidemiology of lung cancer in European women is very worrying.• Lung cancer is becoming the leading cause of cancer mortality in European women.• Women benefit greatly from screening in terms of reduced risk of death from lung cancer.","2023",,"Insights Imaging",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Predicting this toxicity is of clinical interest in order to adapt the irradiation dose delivered. Radiation-induced CD8 T-lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) had been proven to be associated with less grade ≥2 late radiation-induced toxicities in patients with miscellaneous cancers. Tobacco smoking status and adjuvant hormonotherapy were also identified as potential factors related to late-breast-fibrosis-free survival. This article evaluates the predictive performance of the RILA using a ROC curve analysis that takes into account the dynamic nature of fibrosis occurrence. This time-dependent ROC curve approach is also applied to evaluate the ability of the RILA combined with the other previously identified factors. Our analysis includes a Monte Carlo cross-validation procedure and the calculation of an expected cost of misclassification, which provides more importance to patients who have no risk of late fibrosis in order to be able to treat them with the maximal irradiation dose. Performance evaluation was assessed at 12, 24, 36 and 50 months. At 36 months, our results were comparable to those obtained in a previous study, thus underlying the predictive power of the RILA. Based on specificity and cost, RILA alone seemed to be the most performant, while its association with the other factors had better negative predictive value results.","2023",,"Cancers (Basel)",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

There is a paucity of evidence on the risk factors for BC among women of all races in SA. Given the rising prevalence of BC in SA, literature-based evidence is critical for the appropriate dissemination of preventative measures. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with the development of BC among women in Ekhuruleni Metropolitan Municipality.
METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020 using secondary data extracted from the Ekurhuleni Population-Based Cancer Registry. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out using the adjusted odds ratio (aOR). The variables race, employment, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), smoking and alcohol status were included in the multivariable logistic regression model while the model was adjusted for age.
RESULTS: A total of 2,217 cases and 851 controls were enrolled in the study. The mean age (±SD) in years was 55.7 (±15.2). The White population group, being self-employed and being HIV positive was significantly associated with reduced odds of BC development. HIV-positive women were 61% less likely to have BC than women who were HIV-negative (aOR 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27‒0.57). White women were 65% less likely to have BC than women of other races (aOR 0.35; 95% CI: 0.29‒0.43). Self-employed women were 59% less likely to have BC than women who were formally employed (aOR 0.41; 95% CI: 0.18‒0.97). No evidence of association was observed between tobacco smoking and BC as well as alcohol consumption and BC.
CONCLUSION: There was a 65% reduction in BC risk among White women compared to other races. HIV-positive women demonstrated a 61% lower likelihood of BC while self-employed women showed a 59% reduced risk of developing BC. These findings suggest that being White, self-employed or HIV-positive may provide some protection against BC.

This review aims to summarize the current literature on lifestyle behavior change interventions conducted among rural survivors of cancer, with an emphasis on older survivors.
METHODS: A systematic search of five databases identified randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that targeted diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, or tobacco use change in adult cancer survivors living in rural areas of the world.
RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in either Australia or the USA, included survivors at least 6 weeks post-treatment, and half included only breast cancer survivors, while the other four included a mix of cancer types. All but one had a physical activity component. No articles addressed changes in alcohol or tobacco behavior. Seven (87.5%) had a fully remote or hybrid delivery model. Most of the physical activity interventions showed significant changes in physical activity outcomes, while the dietary interventions showed changes of clinical but not statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have been conducted to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle behavior change interventions among older rural survivors of cancer. Future research should evaluate the acceptability and relevancy of adapted, evidence-based intervention with this population.

A total of 341 DHS surveys (including standard, interim, continuous and special DHS surveys) have been conducted in 90 countries since 1985, 316 of which have been completed. A total of 39 (43.3%) of the countries have conducted at least one DHS survey with one or more cancer-specific questions. Of the 316 surveys with available final reports and questionnaires, 81 (25.6%) included at least one cancer-specific question; 54 (17.1%) included questions specific to cervical cancer, 41 (13.0%) asked questions about breast cancer, and 8 (2.5%) included questions related to prostate cancer. Questions related to other cancers (including colorectal, laryngeal, liver, lung, oral cavity, ovarian and non-site-specific cancers) were included in 40 (12.6%) of the surveys. Cancer screening-related questions were the most commonly asked. The majority of the surveys included questions on alcohol and tobacco use, which are known cancer risk factors. The frequency of cancer-specific questions has increased, though unsteadily, since inception of the DHS. Overall, the framing and scope of the cancer questions varied considerably across countries and survey years. To aid the collection of more useful population-level data to inform cancer-control priorities, it is imperative to improve the scope and content of cancer-specific questions in future DHS surveys.","2023",,"PLOS Glob Public Health"," This review examines the DHS questionnaires , with the aim of describing and analysing how cancer-specific questions have been asked from the inception of the surveys to date ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

This study aimed to analyze the trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates by tumor type, sex, age group, and geographic region using data from the Costa Rican National Cancer Registry.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed cancer incidence and mortality anonymized data from the Costa Rican National Cancer Registry between 2010 and 2020. The study included data on cancer cases diagnosed and deaths attributable to cancer within the population.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed variations in cancer incidence and mortality rates based on geographic region, age group, and tumor type. Cancer was most predominant in the province of San Jose, followed by Alajuela, Heredia, Cartago, Guanacaste, and Puntarenas. Breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer were the leading causes of cancer in both sexes. Mortality rates due to gastric cancer and prostate cancer were highest among men, while breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer mortality among women.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study underscore the need for targeted prevention and screening programs, improved access to treatment for patients living in rural areas, and a comprehensive cancer control program in Costa Rica. By implementing evidence-based interventions, such as tobacco control programs, cancer screening initiatives, and equitable access to cancer treatment, the cancer burden in Costa Rica can be mitigated, ultimately improving the overall health of the population.","2023",,"Open J Soc Sci"," This study aimed to analyze the trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates by tumor type , sex , age group , and geographic region using data from the Costa Rican National Cancer Registry ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"37653535","Estimating disparities in breast cancer screening programs towards mortality, case fatality, and DALYs across BRICS-plus.","Mubarik S","BACKGROUND: Numerous studies over the past four decades have revealed that breast cancer screening (BCS) significantly reduces breast cancer (BC) mortality. However, in BRICS-plus countries, the association between BCS and BC case fatality and disability are unknown. This study examines the association of different BCS approaches with age-standardized mortality, case-fatality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates, as well as with other biological and sociodemographic risk variables, across BRICS-plus from a national and economic perspective.
METHODS: In this ecological study applying mixed-effect multilevel regression models, a country-specific dataset was analyzed by combining data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019 on female age-standardized BC mortality, incidence, and DALYs rates with information on national/regional BCS availability (against no such program or only a pilot program) and BCS type (only self-breast examination (SBE) and/or clinical breast examination (CBE) [SBE/CBE] versus SBE/CBE with mammographic screening availability [MM and/or SBE/CBE] versus SBE/CBE/mammographic with digital mammography and/or ultrasound (US) [DMM/US and/or previous tests] in BRICS-plus countries.
RESULTS: Compared to self/clinical breast examinations (SBE/CBE) across BRICS-plus, more complex BCS program availability was the most significant predictor of decreased mortality [MM and/or SBE/CBE: - 2.64, p < 0.001; DMM/US and/or previous tests: - 1.40, p < 0.001]. In the BRICS-plus, CVD presence, high BMI, second-hand smoke, and active smoking all contributed to an increase in BC mortality and DALY rate. High-income and middle-income regions in BRICS-plus had significantly lower age-standardized BC mortality, case-fatality, and DALYs rates than low-income regions when nationwide BC screening programs were implemented.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of mammography (digital or traditional) and BCS is associated with breast cancer burden in BRICS-plus countries, with regional variations. In light of high-quality evidence from previous causal studies, these findings further support the preventive role of mammography screening for BCS at the national level. Intervening on BCS related risk factors may further reduce the disease burden associated with BC.","2023",,"BMC Med",,"other","Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Early Detection of Cancer, TRUE, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Disability-Adjusted Life Years, FALSE, Mammography, FALSE, Cost of Illness, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Chemotherapy is a crucial component of treating HNC, and this study was carried out to determine the Cost Minimization Analysis (CMA) by comparing the price of the high and least expensive branded drugs marketed in India. This study was performed to understand the cost difference (CD), Cost ratio (CR) and percentage of cost variation (PCV) of both individual drugs and the standard anticancer regimens. The Current Index of Medical Stores was used to determine the costs of the most and least expensive branded medications and analysed. The results indicated that Paclitaxel-Cisplatin-5 Fluoruracil chemotherapy regimen exhibited the greatest variance in cost, with the Jan Aushadhi brand of medicine costing 8.1 times and 4.3 times less than the most expensive and cheapest branded drugs, respectively. The cost of the concurrent cisplatin regimen with Jan Aushadi Medicine was Rs 1764, Rs 3489.64 with the lowest branded drug, and Rs 8477 with the most expensive branded drug. Also when compared to Jan Aushadhi medication, the cost of Ciplatin was 4.8 times higher with the most expensive branded drug and 2 times higher with the least expensive branded drug. As far as the authors are aware of this is the first study that addresses the pharmacoeconomic appraisal of treating HNC with various chemotherapy and chemoirradiation regimens.

We report here the pathological characteristics of a breast cancer cohort and risk factors for patients with triple-negative disease. In this case-control study, a prospective breast cancer cohort was evaluated for demographic, reproductive, obesity-related and other risk factors using a validated questionnaire. Tumors were characterized for routine pathological characteristics and immunohistochemical markers of basal-like breast cancer. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constituted cases and those with non-TNBC were controls. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each risk factor and independent associations were tested in an unconditional logistic regression analysis.

The North Africa and Middle East (NAME) region is coping hard with the burden of BC. We aimed to present the latest epidemiology of BC and its risk factors in this region.
METHODS: We retrieved the data on BC burden and risk factors from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to describe BC status in the 21 countries of the NAME region from 1990 to 2019. We explored BC incidence, prevalence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and attributable burden to seven risk factors of female BC, namely, alcohol use, diet high in red meat, low physical activity, smoking, secondhand smoke, high body mass index, and high fasting plasma glucose. Decomposition analysis on BC incidence trend was done to find out the contributing factors to this cancer's growth.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 835,576 (95% uncertainty interval: 741,968 to 944,851) female and 10,938 (9,030 to 13,256) male prevalent cases of BC in the NAME region. This number leads to 35,405 (30,676 to 40,571) deaths among female patients and 809 (654 to 1,002) deaths in male patients this year. BC was responsible for 1,222,835 (1,053,073 to 1,411,009) DALYs among female patients in 2019, with a greater proportion (94.9%) of burden in years of life lost (YLLs). The major contributor to female BC incidence increase in the past three decades was found to be increase in age-specific incidence rates of BC (227.5%), compared to population growth (73.8%) and aging (81.8%). The behavioral risk factors were responsible for majority of attributable female BC burden (DALYs: 106,026 [66,614 to 144,247]). High fasting plasma glucose was found to be the risk factor with the largest effect (DALYs: 84,912 [17,377 to 192,838]) on female BC burden.

Most research has focused on FoR among breast cancer patients, with less attention paid to characterizing levels and correlates of FoR among oral and oropharyngeal cancer survivors. The purpose was to characterize FoR with a measure assessing both global fears and the nature of specific worries as well as evaluate the role of sociodemographic and clinical factors, survivorship care transition practices, lifestyle factors, and depressive symptoms in FoR.
METHODS: Three hundred eighty-nine oral and oropharyngeal survivors recruited from two cancer registries completed a survey assessing demographics, cancer treatment, symptoms, alcohol and tobacco use, survivorship care practices, depression, and FoR.
RESULTS: Forty percent reported elevated global FoR, with similar percentages for death (46%) and health worries (40.3%). Younger, female survivors and survivors experiencing more physical and depressive symptoms reported more global fears and specific fears about the impact of recurrence on roles, health, and identity, and fears about death. Depression accounted for a large percent of the variance. Lower income was associated with more role and identity/sexuality worries, and financial hardship was associated with more role worries.
CONCLUSIONS: FoR is a relatively common experience for oral and oropharyngeal cancer survivors. Many of its correlates are modifiable factors that could be addressed with multifocal, tailored survivorship care interventions.

Its assessment and understanding of the factors influencing its occurrence, is a major issue in the management of patients treated for an early breast cancer (BC). We evaluated 8561 patients during their overall management for a BC. We focus on specific skin toxicities: erythema, fibrosis, telangiectasia and changes of skin colour. These toxicities were assessed at the baseline defined as 0-3-6 (M0), 12 (M12), 36 (M36) and 60 (M60) months. The prevalence of toxicities of interest varied over time, so at M0, 30.4% of patients had erythema while 17.7% of patients had fibrosis. At M60, the prevalence of erythema was 2%, while fibrosis remained stable at about 19%. After adjustments, at M0, there was a significant association between the onset of cutaneous erythema and obesity, the presence of axillary dissection, the type of surgery and the tumour phenotype RH+/HER2+. Concerning fibrosis, a significant association was found, at M12, with the age of the patient, obesity, Charlson score and type of surgery. Concerning the modification of skin colour at M12, we find a link between the age of the patient, obesity, tobacco consumption and alcohol consumption.

Nicotine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that are expressed in cancer cell lines. Here, we examine the role of the α7 nAChR in coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins within breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Pharmacological activation of the α7 nAChR using choline or nicotine was found to increase proliferation, motility, and calcium signaling in MCF-7 cells. This effect of α7 nAChR on cell proliferation was abolished by application of Gαi/o and Gαq protein blockers. Specifically, application of the Gαi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin was found to abolish choline-mediated cell proliferation and intracellular calcium transient response. These findings were corroborated by expression of a G protein binding dominant negative nAChR subunit (α7345-348A), which resulted in significantly attenuating calcium signaling and cellular proliferation in response to choline.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a pan-cancer analysis of over 8,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Machine learning methods were employed to systematically explore the relationship between mutational signatures and TME and develop a risk score based on TME-associated mutational signatures to predict patient survival outcomes. We also constructed an interaction model to explore how mutational signatures and TME interact and influence cancer prognosis.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a varied association between mutational signatures and TME, with the Clock-like signature showing the most widespread influence. Risk scores based on mutational signatures mainly induced by Clock-like and AID/APOBEC activity exhibited strong pan-cancer survival stratification ability. We also propose a novel approach to predict transcriptome decomposed infiltration levels using genome-derived mutational signatures as an alternative approach for exploring TME cell types when transcriptome data are unavailable. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that certain mutational signatures and their interaction with immune cells significantly impact clinical outcomes in particular cancer types. For instance, T cell infiltration levels only served as a prognostic biomarker in melanoma patients with high ultraviolet radiation exposure, breast cancer patients with high homologous recombination deficiency signature, and lung adenocarcinoma patients with high tobacco-associated mutational signature.

There are few studies that have explored the clinicopathological specifics of LC in BC survivors.
METHODS: In this single-institution, retrospective study, we identified BC survivors who subsequently developed LC, examined their breast and LC clinical and pathological characteristics and compared them to the general BC and LC population as published in the literature.
RESULTS: In our study, we found the following associations that could be meaningful: an association between receiving radiation (RT) and LC (including a statistically significant P = .03 chance of ipsilateral LC after BC treatment with RT), a higher incidence and amount of smoking and LC, high BRCA positivity (78.9%) in the few patients who had germline testing, and a higher incidence of EGFR mutations in NSCLC after BC (60.9%) as well as an earlier stage of NSCLC disease.
CONCLUSION: Treatments such as RT, genetic factors such as BRCA mutations, and tobacco use may increase the risk of developing LC amongst BC survivors. Exploring this further can potentially lead to better risk stratification through modified low-dose CT chest screening protocols to catch LCs earlier and ultimately improve outcomes. Past studies have shown that BC survivors who are subsequently diagnosed with NSCLC may have improved OS compared with primary NSCLC and our study showed a high incidence of EGFR mutated NSCLC, which also suggest both improved prognosis and a different molecular profile of NSCLC, which warrants further investigation.

This study examined trends in cancer death rates, overall and for lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate cancer by congressional district.
METHODS: County level cancer death counts and population data from the National Center for Health Statistics were used to estimate relative change in age-standardized cancer death rates from 1996-2003 to 2012-2020 by sex and congressional district.
RESULTS: From 1996-2003 to 2012-2020, overall cancer death rates declined in every congressional district, with most congressional districts showing a 20%-45% decline among males and a 10%-40% decline among females. In general, the smallest percent of relative declines were found in the Midwest and Appalachia, whereas the largest declines were found in the South along the East Coast and the southern border. As a result, the highest cancer death rates generally shifted from congressional districts across the South in 1996-2003 to districts in the Midwest and central divisions of the South (including Appalachia) in 2012-2020.

Most of these studies have been conducted on patient populations focusing on either autologous or implant-based reconstruction without possible predictive indicators for complication disparities for all types of reconstruction procedures. The aim of this study is to elucidate disparities among patient demographics by identifying predictors of complications and postoperative outcomes among different racial/ethnic patients undergoing breast reconstruction utilizing multi-state, multi-institution, and national level data.
METHODS: Patients in the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart that underwent all billable forms of breast reconstruction were identified via CPT codes. Demographics, medical history, and postoperative outcome data were collected by querying relevant reports of CPT, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes. Outcomes analysis was limited to the 90-day global postoperative period. A multivariable logistic-regression analysis was performed to ascertain the effects of age, patient reported ethnicity, coexisting conditions, and reconstruction type on the likelihood of any common postoperative complication occurring. Linearity of the continuous variables with respect to the logit of the dependent variable was confirmed. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
RESULTS: From over 86 million longitudinal patient records, our study population included 104,714 encounters for 57,468 patients who had undergone breast reconstruction between January 2003 and June 2019. Black race (relative to White), autologous reconstruction, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use were independent predictors of increased likelihood of complication. Specifically, the odds ratios for complication occurrence for Black, Hispanic, and Asian ethnicity (relative to White) were 1.09, 1.03, and 0.77, respectively. Black patients had an overall breast reconstruction complication rate of 20.4%, while the corresponding rate for White, Hispanic, and Asian patients were 17.0%, 17.9%, and 13.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis of a national-level database shows that Black patients undergoing implant-based or autologous reconstruction have increased risk of complications, likely due to multifactorial components that play a role in the care of this patient population.

The lowest rates of colorectal cancer were among males born in Central America (IRR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.74) and females born in Central Asia (IRR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.64). Males born in North-East Asia had the lowest rates of prostate cancer (IRR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.38-0.43) and females born in Central Asia had the lowest rates of breast cancer (IRR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.43-0.70). For lung cancer, several migrant groups had higher rates than Australian-born residents, with the highest rates among those from Melanesia (males IRR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.76; females IRR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.10-1.78).
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes cancer patterns among Australian migrants, which are potentially helpful in understanding the etiology of these cancers and guiding the implementation of culturally sensitive and safe prevention measures. The lower incidence rates observed for most migrant groups may be maintained with continued emphasis on supporting communities to minimize modifiable risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption and participation in organized cancer screening programmes. Additionally, culturally sensitive tobacco control measures should be targeted to migrant communities with high lung cancer incidence rates.","2023",,"J Cancer Res Clin Oncol"," PURPOSE : To compare the incidence profile of four major cancers in Australia by place of birth ","other","Male, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Australia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Transients and Migrants, TRUE, Incidence, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Prostatic Neoplasms, TRUE, Lung Neoplasms, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"37066265","Endothelial Dysfunction in Breast Cancer Survivors on Aromatase Inhibitors: Changes over Time.","Shaaban A","BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are recommended as adjuvant treatment for estrogen-receptor positive breast carcinoma in postmenopausal women. Studies demonstrate mixed results as to the impact of AIs on cardiovascular (CV) events and overall survival. With the increasing number of pre- and postmenopausal women on AIs for five to ten years, understanding the long-term impact of AIs on blood vessels and CV risk in cancer survivors is vital.
METHODS: A single arm longitudinal study of 14 postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer prescribed adjuvant AIs at the University of Minnesota. Subjects with a history of tobacco use, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia were excluded. Participants underwent routine labs, blood pressure assessments, and vascular testing at baseline (prior to starting AIs) and at six months. Vascular assessment was performed using the EndoPAT 2000 and HDI/PulseWave CR-2000 Cardiovascular Pro ling System and pulse contour analysis on two occasions as previously described. Vascular measurements were conducted by one trained vascular technician. Assessments were performed in triplicate, and the mean indices were used for analyses. All subjects were on an AI at the follow-up visit. The protocol was approved by the UMN Institutional Review Board and all participants were provided written informed consent. Baseline and follow-up characteristics were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS: After six months of AI treatment, EndoPAT
CONCLUSION: Endovascular dysfunction is an early sign for atherosclerosis and vascular impairment. This study suggests that postmenopausal breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitor therapy develop endothelial dysfunction as early as six months which is a predictor of adverse CV disease. We hypothesize that long-term use of AIs can lead to persistent endothelial dysfunction. It is unclear if these changes are reversible once AI use is discontinued and further investigation is necessary.","2023",,"Res Sq",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

DC phytochemicals induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation signaling pathways, EMT, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and stem cell markers in melanoma cell lines.","Choudhari J","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Prosopis juliflora (Sw.), DC is a xerophytic plant species that extensively grow in Asia, Africa, Australia, and Brazil. From ancient time P. juliflora is being utilized in various folk remedies for example in wound healing, fever, inflammation, measles, excrescences, diarrhea and dysentery. Traditionally, gum, paste, and smoke obtained from the leaves and pods are applied for anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial purposes.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous studies have demonstrated the promising potential of Prosopis Juliflora leaves methanol extract (PJLME) against breast cancer, and suggested its possible integration as a complementary medicine for the effective management of breast cancer. However, evidence against how PJLME mechanistically target the cancer proliferative pathways and other targets is poorly understood. The basic aim of the present study was to understand the anti-melanoma potential of PJLME against B16f10 cells with possible mechanisms of action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. Wound and transwell migration assay was performed to check migration potential of cells after PJLME treatment, while clonogenic assay was carried out to understand its colony inhibition actvity. Flow cytometry was used to perform annexin V/PI assay (apoptosis assay), ROS assay, cell cycle analysis. In-vitro angiogenesis assay was performed to check formation of capillary like vascular structure after PJLME treatment. Apoptotic genes, signaling pathways markers, EMT markers and stem cell markers were determined by western blotting. In-vivo BALB/C mice xenograft model study was performed to check the effect of PJLME on in-vivo melanoma tumor growth.
RESULTS: The experimental outcome of the present study has clearly demonstrated the inhibition of growth, migration, invasion, colony formation and apoptosis inducing potential of PJLME against mouse melanoma cancer cells. Treatment of B16F10 melanoma cells with PJLME resulted in arrest of cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Annexin V-FITC/PI assay confirmed the apoptosis inducing potential of PJLME in B16F10 and A375 melanoma cells. Furthermore, Western blot experiments confirmed that the treatment of PJLME downregulates the expression of anti-apoptotic gene like Bcl2 and increase the expression profile of pro-apoptotic genes like Bax, Bad, and Bak in B16F10 melanoma cells. HUVEC (Human umbilical vein endothelial cells) tube formation assay clearly demonstrated the anti-angiogenic potential of PJLME. The study also revealed that PJLME has potential to inhibit the Akt and Erk signaling pathways which are participating in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion etc. The outcome of qRT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis clearly unveiled that PJLME treatment leads to downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as stem cell markers. Finally, the in-vivo animal xenograft model study also revealed the anti-melanoma potential of PJLME by significantly inhibiting the B16F10 melanoma tumor growth in BALB/c mice model. The LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of PJLME showed the presence of variety of bioactive molecules associated with anticancer effects.
CONCLUSION: The outcome of the present investigation clearly demonstrated the anti-melanoma potential of PJLME against B16f10 melanoma cells. PJLME can be explored as an adjuvant or complementary therapy against melanoma cancer, however further studies are required to understand the clinical efficacy of PJLME. Nevertheless, it can be further explored as a promising resource for identification of novel anticancer candidate drug.","2023",,"J Ethnopharmacol"," Traditionally , gum , paste , and smoke obtained from the leaves and pods are applied for anticancer , antidiabetic , anti-inflammatory , and antimicrobial purposes ","other","Animals, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Prosopis, TRUE, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, FALSE, Endothelial Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, FALSE, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Mice, Inbred BALB C, FALSE, Melanoma, TRUE, drug therapy, Q000188, Signal Transduction, FALSE, Antineoplastic Agents, TRUE, pharmacology, Q000494, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, Apoptosis, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, drug therapy, Q000188, Stem Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cell Movement, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

In the UK, there have been calls for a new cross-government health inequalities strategy. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of national governmental efforts between 1997 and 2010, referred to as the National Health Inequalities Strategy (NHIS).
STUDY DESIGN: population-based observational study.
METHODS: Using Global Burden of Disease data, age-standardised years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) rates per 10,000 were extracted for 150 Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) regions in England for every year between 1990 and 2019. The slope index of inequality was calculated using YLL rates for all causes, individual conditions, and risk factors. Joinpoint regression was used to assess the trends of any changes which arose before, during or after the NHIS.
RESULTS: Absolute inequalities in YLL rates for all causes remained stable between 1990 and 2000, before decreasing over the following 10 years. After 2010, improvements slowed. A similar trend can be observed amongst inequalities in YLLs for individual causes, including ischaemic heart disease, stroke, breast cancer and lung cancer amongst females, and ischaemic heart disease stroke, diabetes and self-harm amongst males. This trend was also observed amongst certain risk factors, notably blood pressure, cholesterol, tobacco and dietary risks. Inequalities were generally greater in males than in females; however, trends were similar across both sexes. The NHIS coincided with significant reductions in inequalities in YLLs due to ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the NHIS coincided with a reduction in health inequalities in England.

Random-effects models were used to compute pooled relative risks (RRs) for cigarette smoking status and dose-risk relationships were evaluated using one-stage random-effects dose-response models.
RESULTS: A total of 169 studies were selected, providing a pooled RR for breast cancer of 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.10) for current, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.06-1.10) for former, and 1.09 (95% CI, 1.07-1.11) for ever smokers, compared to never smokers. Results were consistent in case-control and cohort studies. No meaningful differences were observed across strata of most covariates considered, nor according to relevant genetic mutations and polymorphisms (ie, BRCA mutation, N-acetyltransferase and glutathione S-transferase genotypes, and P53). Breast cancer risk increased linearly with intensity of smoking (RR 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.16 for 20 cigarettes/day and 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.36 for 40 cigarettes/day), and with increasing duration of smoking (RR 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08 for 20 years of smoking and 1.11; 95% CI, 1.06-1.16 for 40 years of smoking).

The causation of these tumors is multifactorial, and the disease process differs at different sites.
AIM: This study aims to determine the clinicopathological patterns of malignant solid tumors in adult patients admitted into the department of internal medicine of a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2018 and June 2018 at the Department of Medicine, Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh. We recorded the complete socio-demographic characteristics, clinical patterns, and pathological characteristics of malignant solid tumors in adult patients.
RESULTS: A total of 100 patients with confirmed malignant solid tumors were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 47.5 years (SD: ±4.20); most of them (27%) were between 58 and 67 years of age. Male patients constitute 59% of the total study sample. Most of the patients were of the middle socio-economic class (59%) and most of them (61%) were nonsmokers. Among the patient diagnoses, 19% had lung cancer, 29.27% had breast cancer, and in 14%, lymphoma (tumor arising from the lymphatic system) was the common solid tumor. Lung cancer was found to be the most common form of cancer in males. Additionally, the majority of those diagnosed with lung cancer smoked. Breast cancer was found to be the most common type of cancer in females.
CONCLUSION: This study reflects that solid malignant tumors can affect any socio-economic class of people. Based on findings in our study as well as others, prevention efforts should focus on the reduction in tobacco use and the incorporation of other lifestyle changes, such as diet modification and exercise. Additionally, the incorporation of economic factors and how they affect cancer presentation in different contexts is crucial.","2023",,"Cureus"," AIM : This study aims to determine the clinicopathological patterns of malignant solid tumors in adult patients admitted into the department of internal medicine of a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are crucial not only for formulating cancer control policies and assessing their effectiveness but also offer essential inputs for programs aimed at preventing cancer. The state of Andhra Pradesh after the division in 2014 has been left with no PBCR. Hence, with the aim to pilot the development of a population-based cohort of cancer cases with digital reporting and monitoring mechanisms, this study was carried out with the objective of finding the prevalence and incidence of various types of cancer in Mangalagiri Mandal, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey during the period January 2021 to June 2022 was conducted to actively search for cancer cases among 160303 people residing in 42639 households in the Mangalagiri Mandal, Guntur district, State of Andhra Pradesh, India. The respondents were asked if anyone in the household had cancer and the location was mapped, the information was recorded by the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers in the pre-tested questionnaire. The total number of cancer cases identified was 107. Results Mangalagiri Mandal had 24 cases of cancer among men and 83 cases of cancer among women as recorded during the study period.

We collected data on sociodemographic factors and health, knowledge of cancer risk factors, and possible behaviour changes (tobacco/alcohol use, diet, physical activity) after cancer diagnosis.
RESULTS: The study involved 1180 women aged between 26 and 79 years. Several cancer-related factors (cancer other than breast cancer, longer time since diagnosis, taking drug treatment for cancer, sequelae, negative evolution of the cancer) favoured certain positive changes in behaviour. Sociodemographic factors (age, habitat environment, currently employed, living status, dependent children) or factors related to health (general condition, presence of comorbidities, neurological problems, hospitalizations, body mass index) favoured or not certain changes in behaviour.

However, there is a lack of data investigating the comparative incidences and risk factors for such lesions.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all consecutively performed reduction mammaplasty cases at a single large academic medical institution in a metropolitan city by two plastic surgeons over a 2-year period. All reduction mammaplasties, symmetrizing reductions, and oncoplastic reductions performed were included. There were no exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 632 breasts were analyzed-502 reduction mammaplasties, 85 symmetrizing reductions, and 45 oncoplastic reductions-in 342 patients. Mean age was 43.9 ± 15.9 years, mean body mass index was 29.2 ± 5.7 kg/m 2 , and mean reduction weight was 610.0 ± 313.1 g. Patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty for benign macromastia had a significantly lower incidence (3.6%) of incidentally found breast cancers and proliferative lesions compared with patients with oncoplastic reductions (13.3%) and symmetrizing reductions (17.6%) ( P < 0.001). On univariate analysis, personal history of breast cancer ( P < 0.001), first-degree family history of breast cancer ( P = 0.008), age ( P < 0.001), and tobacco use ( P = 0.033) were all statistically significant risk factors. Using a backward elimination stepwise reduced multivariable logistic regression model for risk factors associated with breast cancer or proliferative lesions, age ( P < 0.001) was the only retained significant risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative lesions and carcinomas of the breast found in reduction mammaplasty pathologic specimens may be more common than previously reported.

Breast cancer cells lines, MCF-7 were cultured using a transwell coculture model with preadipocytes hMADS cells or were cultured alone. Cells were treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and the four conditions: control, treated by CSE, coculture, and coexposure (coculture and CSE) were compared. We analyzed morphological changes, cell migration, resistance to anoikis, stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the presence of hormonal receptors in each condition. A complete transcriptomic analysis was carried out to highlight certain pathways. We also assessed whether the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a receptor involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, could mediate these modifications. Several hallmarks of metastasis were specific to the coexposure condition (cell migration, resistance to anoikis, stemness characterized by CD24/CD44 ratios and ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 rates) whereas others (morphological changes, EMT, loss of hormonal receptors) could be seen in the coculture condition and were aggravated by CSE (coexposure). Moreover, MCF-7 cells presented a decrease in hormonal receptors, suggesting an endocrine treatment resistance. These results were confirmed by the transcriptomic analysis.

We used metabolomics approaches to investigate the metabolic differences between breast cancer patients and women in the general population, aiming to elaborate metabolic changes among breast cancer patients and identify potential targets for clinical interventions to mitigate long-term sequelae.
METHODS: Serum samples were retrieved from 125 breast cancer cases recruited from the Chicago Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort (ChiMEC), and 125 healthy controls selected from Chicago Multiethnic Prevention and Surveillance Study (COMPASS). We used liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry to obtain untargeted metabolic profiles and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) combined with fold change to select metabolic features associated with breast cancer. Pathway analyses were conducted using Mummichog to identify differentially enriched metabolic pathways among cancer patients. As potential confounders we included age, marital status, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, type 2 diabetes, and area deprivation index in our model. Random effects of residence for intercept was also included in the model. We further conducted subgroup analysis by treatment timing (chemotherapy/radiotherapy/surgery), lymph node status, and cancer stages.
RESULTS: The entire study participants were African American. The average ages were 57.1 for cases and 58.0 for controls. We extracted 15,829 features in total, among which 507 features were eventually selected by our criteria. Pathway enrichment analysis of these 507 features identified three differentially enriched metabolic pathways related to prostaglandin, leukotriene, and glycerophospholipid. The three pathways demonstrated inconsistent patterns. Metabolic features in the prostaglandin and leukotriene pathways exhibited increased abundances among cancer patients. In contrast, metabolic intensity in the glycerolphospholipid pathway was deregulated among cancer patients. Subgroup analysis yielded consistent results. However, changes in these pathways were strengthened when only using cases with positive lymph nodes, and attenuated when only using cases with stage I disease.
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer in African American women is associated with increase in serum metabolites involved in prostaglandin and leukotriene pathways, but with decrease in serum metabolites in glycerolphospholipid pathway.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Kuwait Cancer Registry (KCR) for all Kuwaiti children (0-14 years) and adults (15-99 years) diagnosed with one of 18 common cancers during 2000-2013, with follow-up for vital status to 31 December 2015. World-standardised average annual incidence and mortality rates were calculated for 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2013. Five-year net survival was estimated with the Pohar Perme estimator, corrected for background mortality using life tables of all-cause mortality. Survival estimates were agestandardised using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights.
RESULTS: For liver cancer, five-year net survival increased from 11.4% to 13.4% for patients diagnosed between 2000-2004 and 2010-2013, while incidence and mortality rates fell from 5.5 to 3.6 and from 3.9 to 3.0 per 100,000, respectively. Similar patterns were seen for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoma in children. Survival and mortality remained stable for cancers of the lung, cervix and ovary, but incidence declined from 10.2 to 7.4, 4.9 to 2.4 and 5.8 to 4.3 per 100,000, respectively. For breast cancer, survival increased from 68.3% to 75.2%, while incidence and mortality rose from 45.6 to 58.7 and from 5.8 to 12.8 per 100,000, respectively. For colon cancer, incidence and mortality rates rose from 11.4 to 12.6 and from 2.3 to 5.4 per 100,000, respectively. Five-year survival fell from 64.8% to 50.2% between 2000-2004 and 2005-2009, before rising to 58.5% for 2010-2013.
CONCLUSION: Increasing survival, alongside falling incidence and mortality rates, represents progress in cancer control, attributable to effective prevention (e.g. tobacco control and lung cancer) and early diagnostic activity (e.g. mammography for breast cancer), or better treatment (e.g. childhood ALL).

Cancer screening is the modality for prevention and early recognition of cancer. As per the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), new cancer cases that are expected in 2020 will be more than 1.8 million, with 606,520 cancer deaths. Fortunately, some of the cancers, for instance, colon, lung, cervical, breast cancer, can be detected with screening, which helps in delaying or even halting the progression of cancer.  Screening for cancer is a form of secondary prevention wherein the mortality from cancer is reduced with no change in incidence. Due to significant lag time in the malignant transformation; Screening provides an opportunity to detect premalignant lesions, early intervention in the carcinogenic process, and delay the course of cancer. Most of the risk factors for cancer are preventable. Eliminating the use of tobacco products and secondhand smoke exposure, getting vaccinated (HPV-Human Papilloma Virus), avoiding tanning beds, maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, avoiding processed or red meat, consuming a healthy diet with a high intake of fruits and vegetable are some of the measures that can substantially decrease a person's lifetime risk of developing or dying from cancer. Healthy People Initiative (HPI) is a US program that develops and tracks health objectives for the nation. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a chosen data source for setting and assessing several HPI targets in cancer. The 2015 NHIS findings show that the utilization of cancer screening tests for cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer was below Healthy People 2020 target.

This systematic review aimed to identify existing smoking cessation interventions for this cohort diagnosed with breast, head and neck, lung and cervical cancers (linked to risk). Systematic searches of Pubmed, Embase, Psych Info and CINAHL from 1 January 2015 to 15 December 2020 were conducted. Included studies examined the characteristics of smoking cessation interventions and impact on referrals and quit attempts. The impact on healthcare professionals was included if reported.

,"36543055","The effects of prolonged intraoperative hypothermia on patient outcomes in immediate implant-based breast reconstruction.","Prabhu SS","BACKGROUND: The importance of thermoregulation in surgical procedures has become a recent focus for anesthesiologists and surgeons to improve patient outcomes. In breast surgery, maintenance of normothermia has been shown to reduce surgical-site infections. However, there is a paucity of information evaluating the relationship between intraoperative core body temperatures and reconstructive surgical outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy from 2015 to 2020 was performed. Patients were classified into a majority normothermic (NT) group if patients spent greater than half of the operative time ≥36 °C or a majority hypothermic (HT) group if patients spent greater than or equal to half of the operative time <36 °C. Patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical techniques, and postoperative complications were recorded. Complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification. Univariate and multivariate statistics were used to assess significant relationships.
RESULTS: A total of 329 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 174 were in the NT group and 155 were in the HT group, yielding 302 and 264 total breasts, respectively. There was no significant difference in rates of infection (p = 1.0), seroma (p = 0.27), hematoma (p = 0.61), or wound dehiscence (p = 1.0). However, patients in the HT group had significantly more overall ischemic complications (p = 0.009) and, specifically, grade IIIb ischemic complications (p = 0.04). After controlling for tobacco use, body mass index, mastectomy pattern, radiation, operating surgeon, and mastectomy weight, multivariate analysis showed increased ischemic complications in the HT group (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Prolonged intraoperative hypothermia can increase the risk for the development of ischemic wounds such as tissue necrosis or eschar formation that require operative intervention. This presents reconstructive complications that increase both patient and health system burdens that could be addressed through the maintenance of normothermia. Further studies using real-time flap temperature would provide more accurate insight into the relationship between temperature and implant-based breast reconstruction.","2023",,"J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg",,"other","Humans, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Mastectomy, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Hypothermia, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, surgery, Q000601, Mammaplasty, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009, Breast Implants, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Postoperative Complications, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Nevertheless, as the global population grows, more non-smokers are exposed to second-hand smoke (SHS) hazards. Mitigating SHS hazards requires a systematic analysis of the global disease burden attributable to SHS.
METHODS: Data on SHS was extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. First, we measured the disease burden of SHS by the number of cases and age-standardized rates of deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2019. Second, trends in the disease burden of SHS in different periods were estimated based on the annual percentage change (APC) by joinpoint regression analysis. Finally, using histogram plots, world maps, Pearson correlation analysis, and population attributable fraction (PAF), we conducted a stratified analysis of SHS exposure by sex, age, geographic location, sociodemographic index (SDI) level, and disease.
RESULTS: The number of deaths caused by SHS remained stable between 1990 and 2019, and the number of YLDs more than doubled in three decades. In contrast, the number of DALYs and YLLs caused by SHS decreased. The declining trend in deaths (APC = -1.42 % [95 % UI -1.79 %, -1.05 %]), DALYs (APC = -1.91 % [95 % UI -2.15 %, -1.67 %]), and YLLs (APC = -1.28 % [95 % UI -1.93 %, -0.64 %]) had slowed down in recent years, while SHS-related YLDs were still increasing (APC = 1.84 % [95 % UI 0.74 %, 2.96 %]). From 2010 to 2019, we found that SHS exposure increased the risk of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (PAF increased by 11.75 %), breast cancer (PAF increased by 5.36 %), diabetes mellitus (PAF increased by 8.24 %), and ischemic heart disease (PAF increased by 4.46 %). In addition, the disease burden caused by SHS was highest in middle SDI and low-middle SDI countries.

DESIGN: population-based descriptive study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: incident cancer cases diagnosed in 2010-2014, with follow-up to 2018, from 17 Italian cancer registries (covering 31% of the national population; 43% of the population residing in the North-Centre of the country and 8% of the population living in the South and Islands).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: age-standardized 5-year net survival (NS) by cancer site or type, sex, age, and geographical area.
RESULTS: NS of patients aged ≥15 years with breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers was higher in the North-Centre than in the South and Islands. The overall survival of people diagnosed with cancer in childhood (0-14 years) was 84.3%, with similar values among the geographical macro-areas and between males and females. Women with breast cancer within the current target age of the screening programmes and those in the younger age groups (45-49 years) show similar survival values; the same is true for women with colorectal cancer. In both cases, survival decreased in the age groups after the age of cessation of screening programmes. Survival of patients with tobacco smoke-associated cancers varies according to cancer site (from 11.1% for patients with pancreatic cancer to 79.7% for those with bladder cancer). For most cancer sites, women have higher survival than men.
CONCLUSIONS: for adults, a geographical survival gap persists.

Whether a breast cancer diagnosis, a cancer commonly seen as unrelated to smoking cigarettes, motivates changes in smoking behavior is not fully understood. We aimed to compare long-term changes at three follow-up times of cigarette smoking behavior in women with breast cancer and baseline age- and region-matched unaffected women.
METHODS: We used longitudinal data from the population-based case-control study MARIE (Mamma Carcinoma Risk Factor Investigation). Women with breast cancer (N = 3813) and unaffected women (N = 7341) aged 50-74 years were recruited from 2002 to 2005. Analyses on changes in smoking were based on data from those who also completed follow-up 1 in 2009-2012, follow-up 2 in 2014-2016 and follow-up 3 in 2020. Multinomial logistic regression for changes (quitting, stable, or start smoking) adjusted for age, study region, education, comorbidities, living situation, and follow-up time, was applied to examine the associations between breast cancer status and changes in smoking behavior.
RESULTS: Women with breast cancer had significantly higher odds than unaffected women of quitting smoking (OR = 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.89) and lower odds of returning to smoking (OR = 0.29, 95 % CI: 0.09-0.94) at follow-up 1, but were more likely to start or return to smoking at follow-up 2 (OR = 2.11, 95 % CI 1.08-4.15). No significant group differences were found for changes in smoking behavior at follow-up 3.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that short-term changes in smoking behavior can be attributed to a breast cancer diagnosis, but that over time the effect diminishes and changes in smoking no longer differ between breast cancer and breast cancer-free women.

The initial and periodic screening of these conditions can prevent the risks of disability, poor quality of life, and death. The present study investigated the association between sarcopenia phenotypes and fracture risk, assessed by the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) in women with breast cancer.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study. It included women aged between 40 and 80 years, diagnosed with Luminal subtype breast cancer, with time of diagnosis ≤ 12 months, who had not started endocrine therapy, did not have metastasis, had not been treated for another malignancy, and had no recurrences. Sociodemographic, habits and lifestyle, clinical, anthropometric, and body composition variables were considered. Muscle strength, skeletal muscle mass, and physical performance were investigated using handgrip strength (HGS), appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), and Timed Up and Go test (TUGT), respectively. Fracture risk was assessed using FRAX. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to verify the association between exposure variables and sarcopenia phenotypes. A significance level of p < 0.05 was adopted for all tests using the SPPS 25.0 program.
RESULTS: Sixty-two women with a mean age of 58.1 ± 10.4 years were evaluated. Of these, 66.1% self-declared to be non-white, 41.9% and 71.0% did not consume alcohol or smoke, respectively, and 61.3% were insufficiently active. A total of 45.2% had clinical stage II carcinoma and 65.5% had the invasive breast carcinoma histological subtype. There was a predominance of adequacy of HGS (88.7%), ASMI (94.5%), and TUGT (96.8%), as well as low risk of hip fractures (85.5%) and major fractures (82.3%). HGS remained associated with FRAX hip fractures (p = 0.007) and FRAX major fractures (p = 0.007) in the adjusted models, while ASMI was associated with body mass (p < 0.001).

They require mass and functional production for the assessment of upcoming challenges in the near future. The DARPin family is considered a mimetic pharmaceutical peptide group with high affinity binding to specific targets. DARPin G3 is designed to bind to the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) tyrosine kinase receptor. Overexpression of HER2 is common in some cancers, including breast cancer, and can be used as a prognostic and predictive tool for cancer. The chloroplasts are cost-effective alternatives, equal to, and sometimes better than, bacterial, yeast, or mammalian expression systems. This research examined the possibility of the production of the first antibody mimetic, DARPin G3, in tobacco chloroplasts for HER2 imaging in oncology.
RESULTS: The chloroplast specific DARPin G3 expression cassette was constructed and transformed into N. tabacum chloroplasts. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed integration of transgenes as well as chloroplastic and cellular homoplasmy. The Western blot analysis and ELISA confirmed the production of DARPin G3 at the commercial scale and high dose with the rate of 20.2% in leaf TSP and 33.7% in chloroplast TSP. The functional analysis by ELISA confirmed the binding of IMAC purified chloroplast-made DARPin G3 to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor with highly effective picomolar affinities. The carcinoma cellular studies by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the correct functioning by the specific binding of the chloroplast-made DARPin G3 to the HER2 receptor on the surface of HER2-positive cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSION: The efficient functional bioactive production of DARPin G3 in chloroplasts led us to introduce plant chloroplasts as the site of efficient production of the first antibody mimetic molecules.

We aimed to determine if a urinary biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure is associated with increased rates of RISI during and after breast RT.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with Stage 0-IIIA breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy followed by RT to the breast or chest wall with or without regional nodal irradiation were prospectively enrolled on a multicenter study assessing acute/late RISI. 980 patients with urinary cotinine (UCot) measurements (baseline and end-RT) were categorized into three groups. Acute and late RISI was assessed using the ONS Acute Skin Reaction scale and the LENT-SOMA Criteria.
RESULTS: Late Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ RISI occurred in 18.2% and 1.9% of patients, respectively-primarily fibrosis, pain, edema, and hyperpigmentation. Grade 2+ late RISI was associated with UCot group (P= 006). Multivariable analysis identified UCot-based light smoker/secondhand smoke exposure (HR 1.79, P= .10) and smoking (HR 1.60, p = .06) as non-significantly associated with an increased risk of late RISI. Hypofractionated breast RT was associated with decreased risk of late RISI (HR 0.51, P=.03). UCot was not associated with acute RISI, multivariable analysis identified race, obesity, RT site/fractionation, and bra size to be associated with acute RISI.

OBJECTIVES: This study compared patients' phenotypes, adherence to guidelines recommendations, and patterns of cardiotoxicity between two cardio-oncology programs: one in the Dominican Republic (DR) and the other in Chicago IL, United States (US).
METHODS: Patients being considered for or treated with potentially cardiotoxic drugs were followed before, during, and after chemotherapy through both cardio-oncology clinics, where we recorded and compared clinical, demographic, and echocardiographic data.
RESULTS: We studied 597 consecutive patients, 330 (55%) from the DR and 267 (45%) from the US. DR vs. US mean age 55± 13/52 ± 13 years; female 77/87% (p < 0.001); breast cancer 57/73% (p < 0.001); treated with anthracyclines + taxanes 47/40% (p = 0.151); monoclonal antibodies + taxanes or platins 37/45% (p < 0.001). Cardiotoxicity DR vs. US occurred in 15/7% (p = 0.001); multivariate logistic regression (OR 2.29; 95% CI, 1.31-3.99; p < 0.005) did not identify age >60, HTN, DM, BMI, tobacco or chemotherapy as predictors. Compliance with ASCO guidelines was similar among both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the US cohort, the Caribbean cohort of cancer patients has similar rates of CV risk factors but a higher likelihood of developing drug-induced LV dysfunction. Programs' compliance with ASCO guidelines was equivalent. While further research is needed to ascertain regional variations of cardiotoxicity, these findings underline the relevance of cardio-oncology services in nations with limited resources and high CV risk.","2022",,"Glob Heart"," Little is known about the characteristics of oncological patients , cancer therapy-induced cardiotoxicity , and guidelines-directed interventions in the Caribbean ; analysis of cardio-oncology services may shed light on this and clarify links between ethnicity , cultural , and local socioeconomic factors ","other","Anthracyclines, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Antibodies, Monoclonal, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, chemically induced, Q000139, Cardiotoxicity, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Ethnicity, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Phenotype, FALSE, Taxoids, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, United States, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between tobacco and BC.
METHODS: A search was conducted in PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases before February 2022. The adjusted odd ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to examine the relationship between active or passive smoking and BC risk.
RESULTS: A total of 77 articles composed of 2,326,987 participants were included for this meta-analysis. Active (OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.11-1.20, p<0.001) and passive (OR=1.17, 95% CI=1.09-1.24, p<0.001) smoking increased the risk of BC in the female population, especially premenopausal BC (active smoking: OR=1.24, p<0.001; passive smoking: OR=1.29, p<0.001), but had no effect on postmenopausal BC (active smoking: OR=1.03, p=0.314; passive smoking: OR=1.13, p=0.218). Active smoking increased the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC risk (OR=1.13, p<0.001), but had no effect on estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) BC (OR=1.08, p=0.155). The risk of BC was positively associated with the duration and intensity of smoking, negatively associated with the duration of smoking cessation. Active smoking increased the risk of BC in the multiparous population (OR=1.13, p<0.001), but had no effect on the nulliparous population (OR=1.05, p=0.432), and smoking before the first birth (OR=1.22, 95% CI=1.17-1.27) had a greater impact on the risk of BC than smoking after the first birth (OR=1.08, 95% CI=1.04-1.12).
CONCLUSION: Smoking (active and passive) increased the risk of BC in women. The effect of smoking on BC was influenced by smoking-related factors (duration, intensity, years of quitting), population-related factors (fertility status), and BC subtypes.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether quality of care among patients exposed to telemedicine differs from patients with only in-person office-based care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, standardized quality measures were compared between patients with office-only (in-person) visits vs telemedicine visits from March 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021, across more than 200 outpatient care sites in Pennsylvania and Maryland.
EXPOSURES: Patients completing telemedicine (video) visits.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: χ2 tests determined statistically significant differences in Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality performance measures between office-only and telemedicine-exposed groups. Multivariable logistic regression controlled for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.
RESULTS: The study included 526 874 patients (409 732 office-only; 117 142 telemedicine exposed) with a comparable distribution of sex (196 285 [49.7%] and 74 878 [63.9%] women), predominance of non-Hispanic (348 127 [85.0%] and 105 408 [90.0%]) and White individuals (334 215 [81.6%] and 100 586 [85.9%]), aged 18 to 65 years (239 938 [58.6%] and 91 100 [77.8%]), with low overall health risk scores (373 176 [91.1%] and 100 076 [85.4%]) and commercial (227 259 [55.5%] and 81 552 [69.6%]) or Medicare or Medicaid (176 671 [43.1%] and 52 513 [44.8%]) insurance. For medication-based measures, patients with office-only visits had better performance, but only 3 of 5 measures had significant differences: patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) receiving antiplatelets (absolute percentage difference [APD], 6.71%; 95% CI, 5.45%-7.98%; P < .001), patients with CVD receiving statins (APD, 1.79%; 95% CI, 0.88%-2.71%; P = .001), and avoiding antibiotics for patients with upper respiratory infections (APD, 2.05%; 95% CI, 1.17%-2.96%; P < .001); there were insignificant differences for patients with heart failure receiving β-blockers and those with diabetes receiving statins. For all 4 testing-based measures, patients with telemedicine exposure had significantly better performance differences: patients with CVD with lipid panels (APD, 7.04%; 95% CI, 5.95%-8.10%; P < .001), patients with diabetes with hemoglobin A1c testing (APD, 5.14%; 95% CI, 4.25%-6.01%; P < .001), patients with diabetes with nephropathy testing (APD, 9.28%; 95% CI, 8.22%-10.32%; P < .001), and blood pressure control (APD, 3.55%; 95% CI, 3.25%-3.85%; P < .001); this was also true for all 7 counseling-based measures: cervical cancer screening (APD, 12.33%; 95% CI, 11.80%-12.85%; P < .001), breast cancer screening (APD, 16.90%; 95% CI, 16.07%-17.71%; P < .001), colon cancer screening (APD, 8.20%; 95% CI, 7.65%-8.75%; P < .001), tobacco counseling and intervention (APD, 12.67%; 95% CI, 11.84%-13.50%; P < .001), influenza vaccination (APD, 9.76%; 95% CI, 9.47%-10.05%; P < .001), pneumococcal vaccination (APD, 5.41%; 95% CI, 4.85%-6.00%; P < .001), and depression screening (APD, 4.85%; 95% CI, 4.66%-5.04%; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with telemedicine exposure, there was a largely favorable association with quality of primary care.

This strengthens the interest in chemopreventive agents to be exploited both in healthy and oncological subjects to prevent or repair CS damage. In the present study, we evaluated the chemopreventive properties of the natural sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene towards the damage induced by cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) in triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells. Particularly, we assessed the ability of the sesquiterpene to interfere with the mechanisms exploited by CSC to promote cell survival and chemoresistance, including genomic instability, cell cycle progress, autophagy/apoptosis, cell migration and related pathways. β-Caryophyllene was found to be able to increase the CSC-induced death of MDA-MB-468 cells, likely triggering oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; moreover, it hindered cell recovery, autophagy activation and cell migration; at last, a marked inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation was highlighted: this could represent a key mechanism of the chemoprevention by β-caryophyllene. Although further studies are required to confirm the in vivo efficacy of β-caryophyllene, the present results suggest a novel strategy to reduce the harmful effect of smoke in cancer patients and to improve the survival expectations in breast cancer women.","2022",,"Biomedicines",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

As a first step, we conducted 14 systematic reviews and 32 metanalyses on the safety of MHT (in nine areas: age, time of menopause onset, treatment duration, women with thrombotic risk, women with a personal history of cardiovascular disease, women with metabolic syndrome, women with gastrointestinal diseases, survivors of breast cancer or of other cancers, and women who smoke) and on the most relevant pharmacological interactions with MHT. These systematic reviews and metanalyses helped inform a structured process in which a panel of experts defined the eligibility criteria according to a specific framework, which facilitated the discussion and development process. To unify the proposal, the following eligibility criteria have been defined in accordance with the WHO international nomenclature for the different alternatives for MHT (category 1, no restriction on the use of MHT; category 2, the benefits outweigh the risks; category 3, the risks generally outweigh the benefits; category 4, MHT should not be used).

For each program, the NCI EBCCP repository provides the following expert panel determined summary metrics: (a) program ratings (1-5 scale, 5 best) of research integrity, intervention impact, and dissemination capability, and (b) RE-AIM framework assessment (0-100%) of program reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation. We quantified the number of EBCCPs that met the quality criteria of receiving a score of ≥3 for research integrity, intervention impact, and dissemination capability, and receiving a score of ≥50% for available RE-AIM reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation. For breast cancer risk reduction, we assessed the presence and quality of EBCCPs related to physical activity (PA), obesity, alcohol, tobacco control in early life, breastfeeding, and environmental chemical exposures. Our review revealed several major gaps in EBCCPs for reducing the breast cancer burden: (1) there are no EBCCPs for key breast cancer risk factors including alcohol, breastfeeding, and environmental chemical exposures; (2) among the EBCPPs that exist for PA, obesity, and tobacco control in early life, only a small fraction (24%, 17% and 31%, respectively) met all the quality criteria (≥3 EBCCP scores and ≥50% RE-AIM scores) and; (3) of those that met the quality criteria, only two PA interventions, one obesity, and no tobacco control interventions addressed multiple levels of influence and were developed in populations facing breast cancer disparities.

A substantial body of research has shown associations between epigenetic aging and risk of disease, including cancer. Here we aimed to study epigenetic measures of aging and lifestyle-related factors in association with risk of breast cancer.
METHODS: Using data from four prospective case-control studies nested in three cohorts of European ancestry participants, including a total of 1,655 breast cancer cases, we calculated three methylation-based measures of lifestyle factors (body mass index [BMI], tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and seven measures of epigenetic aging (Horvath-based, Hannum-based, PhenoAge and GrimAge). All measures were regression-adjusted for their respective risk factors and expressed per standard deviation (SD). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional or unconditional logistic regression and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age at blood draw, time from blood sample to diagnosis, oestrogen receptor-positivity status and tumour stage.
RESULTS: None of the measures of epigenetic aging were associated with risk of breast cancer in the pooled analysis: Horvath 'age acceleration' (AA): OR per SD = 1.02, 95%CI: 0.95-1.10; AA-Hannum: OR = 1.03, 95%CI:0.95-1.12; PhenoAge: OR = 1.01, 95%CI: 0.94-1.09 and GrimAge: OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.94-1.12, in models adjusting for white blood cell proportions, body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption. The BMI-adjusted predictor of BMI was associated with breast cancer risk, OR per SD = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.01-1.17. The results for the alcohol and smoking methylation-based predictors were consistent with a null association. Risk did not appear to substantially vary by age at blood draw, time to diagnosis or tumour characteristics.
CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that methylation-based measures of aging, smoking or alcohol consumption were associated with risk of breast cancer.

There is a lack of studies examining the prevalence of anxiety among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in Kazakhstan.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the mean prevalence and associated sociodemographic and clinical factors of anxiety symptoms in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. It also aims to determine independent predictors of anxiety risk.
METHODS: An analysis of 162 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at the oncology institute in Almaty was performed. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire on social, demographic, and clinical information, as well as the Beck Anxiety Inventory. In addition, multiple regression analysis was used to model the relationship between anxiety risk and independent predictors.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 54.41 years (SD=8.1; min.-max: 32-75). The majority of the patients were married (52%), employed or self-employed (51%), had children (91%), had a bachelor's or a graduate degree (50%), lived in an urban area (54%), did not drink (41%), did not smoke (67%), did not engage in physical activity (54%), and had social support (91%). A total of 48% of patients had symptoms of moderate anxiety, and 33% had symptoms of severe anxiety. Based on the multivariate analysis, factors associated with a lower risk of anxiety symptoms included higher household income (OR -2.21 (95 CI: -1.35, -3.07)) and having reliable social support (OR -2.93 (95% CI: -2.25, -3.61)).

The present study aimed to provide an update on the incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC in 2019, based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study.
MATERIALS: The incidence, death rate, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), the age-standardized rates (ASR) of FBC in 204 countries, and a variety of classifications, were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Data on tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and drug use were collected. The incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC were registered and compared between regions. Associations between age-standardized incidence rates and age-standardized mortality rates of FBC with smoking, drinking, and drug use were determined.
RESULTS: The highest incidence of FBC was observed in countries with a high socioeconomic status such as those of the European continent. Despite the lower incidence of FBC in countries with a low socio-demographic index (SDI), mortality rates secondary to FBC are higher in these countries than in high-income countries. The highest age-standardized mortality rate has been reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), followed by the African Region (AFRO). The highest age-standardized rates of DALY and YLL per 100,000 population in 2019 were observed in lower-income countries, while the highest ASR of YLD per 100,000 population was reported in high-income countries.
CONCLUSION: The present GBD-based study provides a comprehensive review of the incidence, mortality, and burden of FBC in 2019.

The change in cancer-related mortality over the years was evaluated using Joinpoint Regression Analysis (JRA).
RESULTS: Total cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually between 2009 and 2014 and decreased by 2.9% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05). Among men; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.4% annually between 2009 and 2014 and decreased by 3.4% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05), stomach cancer-related deaths decreased by 5.1% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05), colon cancer-related deaths increased by 5.8% annually between 2009 and 2015 and decreased by 3.3% annually between 2015 and 2019 (p < 0.05), pancreatic cancer-related deaths increased annually by 5.6% in 2009-2013 (p < 0.05).

Given the growing population of Latino/as immigrants aged ≥60 years and the current lack of relevant data, this study aims to understand the cancer prevention and perception of cancer diagnosis among older Latinos to ensure that they receive effective prevention, intervention, and psychosocial care.
METHOD: A survey exploring attitudes about cancer was developed and administered in Spanish. Using convenience sampling, 168 individuals identifying as Latino/as were surveyed in Tampa, Florida. Descriptive analysis was conducted to understand study population characteristics. Frequencies were assessed to understand the participants' responses to cancer-related attitude questions. The effects of age, country of origin, length of stay in the United States, and marital status on the participants' cancer-related attitudes were assessed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 67.9 years, 34.5% were male, and the mean length of stay in the United States was 25.8 years. In total, 29% and 24.4% of the participants knew that breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively, can be diagnosed early. Individuals with an elementary education were less likely to have sufficient knowledge of cancer prevention and diagnosis.

It has been reported that tobacco components directly reach the mammary gland tissue, causing smoking-related DNA damage and biological effects. We hypothesized that smoking may have characteristics that affect the therapeutic effect and clinical course in patients with stage IV hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRBC) who received endocrine therapy as the first-line treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients diagnosed with stage IV HRBC were treated with endocrine therapy as the first-line treatment. Before treatment, the period and amount of smoking were confirmed through patient interviews, and each pack-year was recorded.
RESULTS: Disease progression with new metastases was more frequent in smokers than non-smokers during endocrine therapy as first-line treatment (p=0.034). Furthermore, as the pack-year increased, new metastases tended to appear [pack-year ≤15; hazard ratio (HR)=1.929, p=0.507; pack-year 15-30, HR=3.857, p=0.223; pack-year >30, HR=7.714, p=0.028].

We also examined differences in mammogram screening by race/ethnicity, age, and health care coverage.
METHODS: Data were from 1884 women participants in the 2018 Health of Houston Survey study. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between smoking status (current/former/non-smokers) and mammograms within 12 months. Moderators included race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Black, Asian, Other, White), age, and health care coverage.
RESULTS: In comparison to women who were non-smokers, current and former smokers showed lower odds to get a yearly mammogram (OR = 0.720; 95% CI = 0.709, .730 and OR = 0.702; 95% CI = 0.693, 0.710, respectively). Current smokers who identified as Hispanic or Black women and former smokers who identified as Hispanic, Asian, and other women showed lower odds of getting a mammogram (OR = 0.635, 95% CI = 0.611, 0.659; OR = 0.951, 95% CI = 0.919, 0.985) and (OR = 0.663, 95% CI = 0.642, 0.684; OR = 0.282, 95% CI = 0.263, 0.302; OR = 0.548, 95% CI = 0.496, 0.606) compared to White women. There were significant interactions by age and health care coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: Women of color who are current and former smokers showed lower odds to engage in mammogram screening, thus increasing their risk of undiagnosed breast cancer when compared to non-smokers. Ethnically diverse women already experience increased health disparities and smoking puts them at exacerbated risk of health complications and death.
IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that smoking status is a modifiable behavioral risk factor that requires further attention in the prevention of breast cancer in ethnic minority women. Health care institutions and policymakers need to increase their awareness of and outreach efforts to women of color who smoke. These outreach efforts should focus on increasing access to smoking interventions and cancer screenings.","2023",,"Nicotine Tob Res",,"other","Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Cigarette Smoking, TRUE, Ethnicity, FALSE, Health Inequities, FALSE, Minority Groups, FALSE, Skin Pigmentation, FALSE, Mammography, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

PAH exposure might be particularly detrimental during pregnancy, as this is a time when the breast tissue of both the mother and daughter is undergoing structural and functional changes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ambient PAH exposure during pregnancy is associated with breast tissue composition, measured one to two decades later, in adolescent daughters and their mothers.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis using data from a New York City cohort of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic mother-daughter dyads (recruited 1998-2006). During the third trimester of pregnancy, women wore backpacks containing a continuously operating air sampling pump for two consecutive days that measured ambient exposure to eight carcinogenic higher molecular weight nonvolatile PAH compounds (Σ8 PAH) and pyrene. When daughters (n = 186) and mothers (n = 175) reached ages 11-20 and 29-55 years, respectively, optical spectroscopy (OS) was used to evaluate measures of breast tissue composition (BTC) that positively (water content, collagen content, optical index) and negatively (lipid content) correlate with mammographic breast density, a recognized risk factor for breast cancer. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate associations between ambient PAH exposure and BTC, overall and by exposure to household tobacco smoke during pregnancy (yes/no). Models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, and percent body fat at OS.
RESULTS: No overall associations were found between ambient PAH exposure (Σ8 PAH or pyrene) and BTC, but statistically significant additive interactions between Σ8 PAH and household tobacco smoke exposure were identified for water content and optical index in both daughters and mothers (interaction p values < 0.05). Σ8 PAH exposure was associated with higher water content (β

METHODS: Postmenopausal women who underwent medical examinations in one health-checkup agency in Tianjin from May 2015 to October 2015 were enrolled in this study. The ICVD 10-year Risk Assesment Form developed by the research team of the National ""Tenth Five-Year Plan"" research project was used to assess the factors affecting the risk of ICVD. Based on the social-ecological model, multiple types of scales, including physical activities, depression, Type D personality, social supports, and environment score, were used to comprehensively explore the factors associated with ICVD in postmenopausal women.
RESULTS: 300 valid questionnaires were obtained, with an effective rate of 92.0%. The subjects aged 44-74 years, with the average age of 62.06 ± 7.09 years. Among them, 58.67% of the subjects only obtained high-school diploma, 32.67% obtained college or university diploma, 90.33% were retirees, 95.33% were married, 92.33% experienced the natural menopause, 93.33% lived in urban or suburban areas, and 1.00% had a history of breast cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that monthly income (¥), parity, exposure to second-hand or third-hand smoke, easy access to healthy food, physical activities, depression, Type D personality, social support and environmental factors were associated with the risk of ICVD in postmenopausal women (P < 0.05). Among them, easy access to healthy food (OR = 0.242), social support (OR = 0.861) and environmental factors (OR = 0.866) were protective factors from ICVD. OR < 1 indicates that the exposure factor is negatively correlated with the disease, and the exposure factor has a protective effect on preventing the occurrence of the disease. Parity (OR = 3.795), exposure to second-hand or third-hand smoke (OR = 2.886), depression (OR = 1.193), and Type D personality (OR = 1.148) were risk factors of ICVD. OR > 1 means that the exposure factor is positively correlated with the disease, and the exposure factor increases the risk of disease occurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: For postmenopausal women, in the future, in addition to prevention and management of the conventional risks, the conditions of their mentality and social support should be paid attention to, at the same time, and if they can, try to choose a good community environment to live in, which could better reduce the incidence and mortality of ICVD in postmenopausal women.","2022",,"Eur J Med Res"," OBJECTIVE : Based on the social-ecological model , this study aimed to comprehensively explore factors affecting the risk of ischemic cerebrovascular disease ( ICVD ) in postmenopausal women to provide theoretical bases for further prevention and intervention for postmenopausal women ","other","Aged, FALSE, Cerebrovascular Disorders, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Exercise, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Postmenopause, FALSE, Pregnancy, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The present report examines these issues from a continuous bivariate perspective with subsequent reports continuing categorical and detailed analyses.
METHODS: Age-standardized state census incidence of 28 cancer types (including ""All (non-skin) Cancer"") was sourced using SEER*Stat software from Centres for Disease Control and National Cancer Institute across US states 2001-2017. It was joined with drug exposure data from the nationally representative National Survey of Drug Use and Health conducted annually by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2003-2017, response rate 74.1%. Cannabinoid data was from Federal seizure data. Income and ethnicity data sourced from the US Census Bureau. Data was processed in R.
RESULTS: Nineteen thousand eight hundred seventy-seven age-standardized cancer rates were returned. Based on these rates and state populations this equated to 51,623,922 cancer cases over an aggregated population 2003-2017 of 124,896,418,350.

A tissue pre-mapping method could indicate neoplastic areas to the pathologist and enable focused sampling. Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) is a rapid and affordable technology for complex gas mixture analysis. We present an automated tissue laser analysis system for imaging approaches (iATLAS), which utilizes a computer-controlled laser evaporator unit coupled with a DMS gas analyzer. The system is demonstrated in the classification of porcine tissue samples and three human breast carcinomas. Tissue samples from eighteen landrace pigs were classified with the system based on a pre-designed matrix (spatial resolution 1-3 mm). The smoke samples were analyzed with DMS, and tissue classification was performed with several machine learning approaches. Porcine skeletal muscle (n = 1030), adipose tissue (n = 1329), normal breast tissue (n = 258), bone (n = 680), and liver (n = 264) were identified with 86% cross-validation (CV) accuracy with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Further, a panel tissue that comprised all five tissue types was applied as an independent validation dataset. In this test, 82% classification accuracy with CNN was achieved. An analogous procedure was applied to demonstrate the feasibility of iATLAS in breast cancer imaging according to 1) macroscopically and 2) microscopically annotated data with 10-fold CV and SVM (radial kernel). We reached a classification accuracy of 94%, specificity of 94%, and sensitivity of 93% with the macroscopically annotated data from three breast cancer specimens.

We hypothesized that smoking cessation would improve survival outcomes of BC patients who were smokers at the time of diagnosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of self-identified smokers with BC treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patient demographics, date of diagnosis, tumor stage, tobacco treatment program (TP) participation, and time to death were extracted from our departmental databases and institutional electronic health records. We examined associations between tobacco abstinence status and survival using survival models, with and without interactions, adjusted for personal characteristics and biomarkers of disease.
RESULTS: Among all 31,069 BC patients treated at MD Anderson between 2006 and 2017, we identified 2126 smokers (6.8%). From those 2126 self-identified smokers, 665 participated in the TP, reporting a conservative estimate of 31% abstinence (intent-to-treat) 9 months into the program. Patients without reported follow-up abstinence status (including TP and non-TP participants) were handled in the analyses as smokers. Survival analysis controlled for multiple factors, including disease characteristics and participation in the TP, indicated that abstainers were more likely to be alive with no evidence of disease compared to non-abstainers (HR, 0.593; 95% CI, 0.386-0.911;

Photo-toxicity results from photochemical damage to the pigmented epithelium and retinal photoreceptors responsible for the visual function of the retina. Their photosensitive pigments, opsins for the cones and rhodopsin for the sticks, are consumed during the day and regenerated at night. Exposure to light at night seriously disrupts their metabolism. Photo-toxicity, along with heredity, is a major factor in degenerative diseases of the retina with, in addition to, the impact of age and tobacco for the most common of them, age-related macular degeneration: ARMD.Exposure to artificial light at night (LAN) has a deleterious effect on the internal clock. Intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells (ipRGSs) are responsible for the non-visual functions of the retina, and perceive the light signal that is transmitted to the internal clock to reach the pineal gland. Light inhibits the secretion of melatonin and is able to advance or delay the clock depending on the time of exposure, causing desynchronization. Shift and night workers, like teenagers, are exposed to LAN. The incidence of breast cancer, higher in nurses exposed to LAN, is related to melatonin inhibition, sleep deprivation and desynchronization. The exposure of adolescents to screens is also questionable because the LEDs of the devices emit a blue light, the impact of which on the clock is considerable. The chronic desynchronizations of both shiftworkers and adolescents should be considered a major public health concern.","2022",,"Rev Prat",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Light, FALSE, Light Pollution, TRUE, Melatonin, TRUE, physiology, Q000502, Public Health, FALSE, Retina, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Infectious agents are the third most important risk factor for cancer incidence after tobacco and obesity. Dysbiosis emerged as a key player that may influence cancer development, treatment, and prognosis through diverse biological processes. Metastatic BC has a highly variable clinical course, and more recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become an emerging therapy in BC. Even with standardised treatment protocols, patients do not respond similarly, reflecting each individual´s heterogeneity, unique BC features, and tumour microenvironment. However, there is insufficient data regarding predictive factors of response to available treatments for BC. The microbiota could be a crucial piece of the puzzle to anticipate better individual BC risk and prognosis, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical efficacy. In recent years, it has been shown that gut microbiota may modulate cancer treatments' efficacy and adverse effects, and it is also apparent that both cancer itself and anticancer therapies interact with gut microbiota bidirectionally. Moreover, it has been proposed that certain gut microbes may protect the host against inappropriate inflammation and modulate the immune response. Future clinical research will determine if microbiota may be a prognostic and predictive factor of response to ICI and/or its side effects. Also, modulation of microbiota can be used to improve outcomes in BC patients. In this review, we discuss the potential implications of metabolomics and pharmacomicrobiomics that might impact BC immunotherapy treatment.","2021",,"Front Oncol",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: We followed 45 923 never-smoking women, aged 34-70 years, who completed a baseline questionnaire between 1991 and 2007 through linkages to national registries through December 2018. We used Cox proportional-hazards models to estimate age-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We estimated the attributable and the population attributable fraction of breast cancer with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 19.8 (6.8) years, 2185 women developed invasive breast cancer, confirmed by histology. Women exposed to SHS from parents during childhood had an 11% higher (95% CI: 1.02-1.22) risk of breast cancer compared with those who were not.

METHODS: In this pilot, cross-sectional study, data were collected via postal surveys in women who had a history of smoking and breast cancer (N = 69). Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with smoking status.
RESULTS: Of this sample, 13 were current smokers and 56 were former smokers. Age, race, education, and employment status were not associated with smoking status. Women with a higher income were significantly more likely to have successfully quit smoking (former smoking OR = 5.94, p < 0.05). Most women were light smokers and reported intentions to quit.
CONCLUSION: The study attests to the addictive nature of smoking and the difficulty in achieving successful quitting even after breast cancer diagnosis. Results highlighted the role of low income as a barrier in smoking cessation.

METHODS: Whole blood was collected at serial timepoints from metastatic breast cancer patients and healthy donors for circulating tumor cell (CTC) and platelet PD-L1 analysis with a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (Biolegend clone 29E.2A3) using the CellSearch® assay. CTC PD-L1 was considered positive if detected on at least 1% of the cells; platelet PD-L1 was considered positive if ≥100 platelets per CellSearch frame expressed PD-L1.
RESULTS: A total of 207 specimens from 124 metastatic breast cancer patients were collected. 52/124 (42%) samples at timepoint-1 (at or close to time of progressive disease) had ≥5 CTC/7.5ml whole blood. Of those, 21 (40%) had positive CTC PD-L1. In addition, platelet PD-L1 expression was observed in 35/124 (28%) at timepoint-1. Platelet PD-L1 was not detected in more than 70 specimens from 12 healthy donors.

However, few researches have focused on the consumption of psychoactive substances in women treated for breast cancer. The present study describes the prevalence of tobacco and alcohol consumption and their relationships with the sociodemographic, medical and psychological variables in a population of women receiving surgery treatment for breast cancer.
METHODS: Between October 2014 and August 2015, a group of women receiving breast cancer treatment were recruited to participate to a screening and brief intervention program (SBI) for the consumption of tobacco and alcohol, adapted to the oncology context. Data on tobacco and alcohol consumption were collected using two questionnaires : the smoking status identification (NIDA) and alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C). A questionnaire for socio- demographic data and two for psychological data (Thermometer of psychological distress; ESAS), have been used. The medical data were reported by participants and verified on medical records.
RESULTS: In a total of 11 months, 120 women with breast cancer were included in this study. A large majority of patients were hospitalized for a first-time cancer (80.8%), type invasive ductal carcinoma (70.8%) and were receiving surgery as primary treatment (45%). Furthermore, 30.8% of the women reported tobacco consumption and 38.4% high-risk alcohol consumption. Regarding mental health, 40.8% presented moderate to intense levels of psychological distress. No significant relationships were found between consumption scores and sociodemographic, medical or psychological characteristics.

This study aimed to analyze cost-effectiveness evidence associated with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality measures.
METHODS: After classifying 23 quality measures with the Donabedian's structure-process-outcome quality of care model, we identified cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) relevant to these measures from the Tufts Medical Center CEA Registry based on the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, time horizon, and setting) framework. We then summarized available incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) to determine the cost-effectiveness of the quality measures.
RESULTS: The 23 quality measures were categorized into 14 process, 7 outcome, and 2 structure measures. Cost-effectiveness evidence was only available for 8 of 14 process measures. Two measures (Tobacco Screening and Hemoglobin bA1c Control) were cost-saving and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) improving, and 5 (Depression Screening, Influenza Immunization, Colon Cancer Screening, Breast Cancer Screening, and Statin Therapy) were highly cost-effective (median ICER ≤ $50 000/QALY). The remaining measure (Fall Screening) had a median ICER of $120 000/QALY. No CEAs were available for 15 measures: 10 defined by subjective patient ratings and 5 employed outcome measures without specifying an intervention or process.
CONCLUSIONS: When relevant CEAs were available, cost-effectiveness evidence was consistent with quality measures (measures were cost-effective). Nevertheless, most quality measures were based on subjective ratings or outcome measures, posing a challenge in identifying supporting economic evidence. Refining and aligning quality measures with cost-effectiveness evidence can help further improve healthcare efficiency by demonstrating that they are good indicators of both quality and cost-effectiveness of care.","2021",,"Value Health"," OBJECTIVES : Despite its importance of quality measures used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the underlying cost-effectiveness evidence has not been examined ","other","Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S., TRUE, Cost-Benefit Analysis, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Quality Indicators, Health Care, FALSE, economics, Q000191, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, FALSE, United States, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between smoking and early menopause, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Korean National Health and Nutritional Survey Examination (KHANES) (2016-2018). Early menopause was defined as menopause before 50 years of age.
RESULTS: A total of 4,481 participants were included in the analysis. There was no association between early menopause and cervical cancer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.435, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.730-2.821), but women who had experienced early menopause had a significantly higher risk of breast cancer than women who had experienced normal menopause (aOR: 1.683, 95% CI: 1.089-2.602, p=0.019). Early menopause was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in ever-smoker (aOR: 0.475, 95% CI: 0.039-5.748), but was associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer in never-smokers (aOR: 1.828, 95% CI: 1.171-2.852).

METHODS: The dosimetric analysis of 30 treatment plans was done with or without ENI. The planning and dose-volume histograms were analyzed, and the impact on the mortality of cardiovascular and lung cancer was estimated based on the correlation of the dosimetric data with data from population studies.
RESULTS: RT with ENI increased the doses in the lungs and heterogeneity in the plans compared to breast-exclusive RT. When the increase in MDs is correlated with the increase of late side-effect risks, the most important effect of ENI is the increased risk of lung cancer, especially in patients who smoke (average increase in absolute risk=1.38%). The increase in the absolute risk of cardiovascular diseases was below 0.1% in the all the situations analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: ENI increases the heterogeneity and the doses at the lungs. When recommending ENI, the risks and benefits must be taken into account, considering the oncology factors and the plan of each patient.

METHODS: We examined National Family Health Survey data for the respective states in which registries are located, on relevant indicators like multiparity, early childbearing, cervical examination, multiple sexual partners/high-risk sexual behavior, and HIV prevalence (for cervical cancer), multiparity, early childbearing, duration of breastfeeding, overweight, alcohol use, and clinical breast examination (for breast cancer). We used Global Adult Tobacco Survey smoking data.
RESULTS: The top four positions in cancer cervix were all in registries from northeast India with a higher proportion of multiparous women (≥3 births; around 40%), whereas three major metros in the south and the national capital of Delhi, all with a relatively low proportion of multiparous women (11-25%) topped the chart for breast cancer. Overweight/obesity was higher in states with a higher incidence of breast cancer (23.3-31%) compared to states with a lower incidence (12.2-16%). No clear patterns emerged with regard to alcohol consumption, duration of breastfeeding or clinical breast examination.
CONCLUSION: The shift in the childbearing age group explains the increasing breast cancer rates in urban areas, whereas the persisting higher rate of multiparity explains higher cervical cancer rates especially in underserved states in the northeast.

The results of some epidemiological studies suggest that one of the lifestyle factors likely altering breast density is cigarette smoking. The aim of this study was to assess the association between active smoking, considering in detail the duration and intensity of smoking, and MBD among Polish women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 467 women aged 40-60 years who underwent screening mammography in Łódź, Poland. Volumetric mammographic density, fibroglandular tissue volume and non-fibroglandular tissue volume were determined based on the analysis of mammographic image (in the ""for processing"" format) using Volpara Imaging Software. Current and lifetime intensity of cigarette smoking was assessed based on the data from interviews. Linear and logistic regressions were fitted with estimated MBD parameters as the outcomes, and life-long smoking duration and intensity as the determinants, adjusted for major confounders.
RESULTS: The former smokers had a significantly lower volumetric mammographic density compared to the non-smokers in the crude analysis (p = 0.022). However, the associations became insignificant after adjustments for important confounding factors. The analyses adjusted for important confounders revealed an inverse statistically significant association between the number of pack-years and volumetric mammographic density among the current smokers (p = 0.048).

Knowledge of both protective and negative risk factors is essential for a better understanding of this heterogenous disease. We undertook a review of the recent literature and evaluated the relationship between obesity mediators and breast cancer development depending on menopausal status. Excess weight is now pandemic and has replaced tobacco as the main lifestyle-related risk factor for premature death. Although the prevalence of obesity/overweight has increased globally over the last 50 years, the potential harm attributable to excess fat has generally been underestimated. The relationship between overweight/obesity, breast cancer and overall risk appears to be highly dependent on menopausal status. Thus, obesity increases the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women but, conversely, it appears to be protective in premenopausal women. We evaluate the role of different clinical factors potentially involved in this seemingly contradictory relationship, including estrogen, mammogram density, adipokines, insulin-signaling pathway activation, and inflammatory status. A key focus of this review is to better understand the impact of body mass index and menopausal status on these clinical factors and, hence, provide some clarity into the inter-relationships involved in this controversial issue.","2021",,"Front Oncol",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Recent work has also explored how the immune-modulating functions of ultraviolet radiation affect type II diabetes, cancer, and the current global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. These diseases are particularly important amidst global changes in lifestyle that result in unhealthy eating, increased sedentary habits, and alcohol and tobacco consumption. Compelling epidemiological data shows increased ultraviolet radiation associated with reduced rates of certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and ultraviolet radiation exposure correlated with susceptibility and mortality rates of COVID-19.

In addition, tools are developed to allow country contextualisation of the analyses to support local priority setting exercises.
METHODS: This analysis follows the standard WHO-CHOICE (World Health Organization-Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective) approach to generalized cost-effectiveness analysis applied to two regions, Eastern sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. The scope of the analysis is all NCD and mental health interventions included in WHO guidelines or guidance documents for which the health impact of the intervention is able to be identified and attributed.

METHODS: Age-adjusted incidence rates for all invasive cancers were calculated for South Asian (Indian, Pakistani), Chinese, and Vietnamese cancer cases reported to the Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR). Additionally, rates were calculated for the most frequent cancers among non-Hispanic Asians (prostate, colorectal, female breast, female thyroid, lung, and male liver). The 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine statistical significance between the rates.
RESULTS: South Asian and Vietnamese females had significantly elevated rates of all invasive cancers compared to Chinese females, while Chinese and South Asian females had a significantly elevated breast cancer rate.

Use of deep learning-based modeling that enables universal natural language processing of medical narratives to acquire population-based real-life smoking data may help overcome the challenge. We assessed the effect of smoking status and within-1-year smoking cessation on CM by an in-house adapted freely available language processing algorithm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional real-world study included 29 823 patients diagnosed with cancer in 2009-2018 in Southwest Finland. The medical narrative, International Classification of Diseases-10th edition codes, histology, cancer treatment records, and death certificates were combined. Over 162 000 sentences describing tobacco smoking behavior were analyzed with ULMFiT and BERT algorithms.
RESULTS: The language model classified the smoking status of 23 031 patients. Recent quitters had reduced CM [hazard ratio (HR) 0.80 (0.74-0.87)] and OM [HR 0.78 (0.72-0.84)] compared to persistent smokers. Compared to never smokers, persistent smokers had increased CM in head and neck, gastro-esophageal, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma, irrespective of age, comorbidities, performance status, or presence of metastatic disease. Increased CM was also observed in smokers with colorectal cancer, men with melanoma or bladder cancer, and lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, but no longer independently of the abovementioned covariates. Specificity and sensitivity were 96%/96%, 98%/68%, and 88%/99% for never, former, and current smokers, respectively, being essentially the same with both models.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning can be used to classify large amounts of smoking data from the medical narrative with good accuracy. The results highlight the detrimental effects of persistent smoking in oncologic patients and emphasize that smoking cessation should always be an essential element of patient counseling.","2021",,"ESMO Open",,"other","Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Deep Learning, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, TRUE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Smoking Cessation, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

This review considers epidemiologic and biological aspects of these associations, focusing particularly on estrogen signaling, and contrasts them with those for breast cancer, another estrogen-related malignancy. The observational findings regarding the inverse associations are consistent and remain after adjustment for possible confounding factors. In general, women who smoke do not have lower circulating estrogen levels than nonsmokers, eliminating one possible explanation for reduced risks of these malignancies. For endometrial and endometrioid ovarian cancer, the negative associations could plausibly be explained by interference with signaling through the estrogen receptor α. However, this is unlikely to explain the lower risks of thyroid and clear cell ovarian cancers. For thyroid cancer, an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine and reduced TSH levels from smoking have been proposed explanations for the inverse association, but both lack convincing evidence.

,"33956307","Domain adaptation and self-supervised learning for surgical margin detection.","Santilli AML","PURPOSE: One in five women who undergo breast conserving surgery will need a second revision surgery due to remaining tumor. The iKnife is a mass spectrometry modality that produces real-time margin information based on the metabolite signatures in surgical smoke. Using this modality and real-time tissue classification, surgeons could remove all cancerous tissue during the initial surgery, improving many facets of patient outcomes. An obstacle in developing a iKnife breast cancer recognition model is the destructive, time-consuming and sensitive nature of the data collection that limits the size of the datasets.
METHODS: We address these challenges by first, building a self-supervised learning model from limited, weakly labeled data. By doing so, the model can learn to contextualize the general features of iKnife data from a more accessible cancer type. Second, the trained model can then be applied to a cancer classification task on breast data. This domain adaptation allows for the transfer of learnt weights from models of one tissue type to another.
RESULTS: Our datasets contained 320 skin burns (129 tumor burns, 191 normal burns) from 51 patients and 144 breast tissue burns (41 tumor and 103 normal) from 11 patients. We investigate the effect of different hyper-parameters on the performance of the final classifier. The proposed two-step method performed statistically significantly better than a baseline model (p-value < 0.0001), by achieving an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 92%, 88% and 92%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first application of domain transfer for iKnife REIMS data. We showed that having a limited number of breast data samples for training a classifier can be compensated by self-supervised learning and domain adaption on a set of unlabeled skin data. We plan to confirm this performance by collecting new breast samples and extending it to incorporate other cancer tissues.","2021",,"Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg"," PURPOSE : One in five women who undergo breast conserving surgery will need a second revision surgery due to remaining tumor ","other","Algorithms, FALSE, Area Under Curve, FALSE, Breast, FALSE, surgery, Q000601, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Calibration, FALSE, Carcinoma, Basal Cell, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Machine Learning, FALSE, Margins of Excision, TRUE, Mastectomy, FALSE, Mastectomy, Segmental, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Operating Rooms, FALSE, Reproducibility of Results, FALSE, Sensitivity and Specificity, FALSE, Skin, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Skin Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Stochastic Processes, FALSE, Supervised Machine Learning, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Nectin-4 expression positively correlated with occurrence risk factors associated with breast cancer (alcohol, smoke, lifestyle habit, etc), CXCR4 expression, and LYVE-1-lymphatic vessel density (LVD). LVD was significantly higher in axillary lymph node (ALN) than primary tumor.

Nectin-4 stimulated the expressions of CXCR4 and CXCL12 under hypoxic conditions in ALN derived primary cells. Further, Nectin-4 augmented expressions of lymphatic metastatic markers (e.g. eNOS, TGF-β, CD-105) and MMPs. Induced expressions of Nectin-4 along with other representative metastatic markers were noted in lymph and blood circulating tumor cells (LCTCs and BCTCs) of local and distant metastatic samples.

METHODS: 477 patients who underwent reduction mammoplasty in the plastic surgery department between October 2013 and January 2020 were included in this study. Patients were evaluated according to age, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity factors, tobacco use, family history and histopathological findings.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 42.43±12.05 years. Body mass index ranged from 23 to 34.6. As for comorbidity factors, 12 patients had hypertension, five patients had asthma and six patients had diabetes mellitus. Seventeen patients (3.6%) were smokers, and 25 (5.2%) patients had a family history of breast cancer. Among the patients, 2.3% were 20 years and under, 17.1% were between 21 and 30 years old, 21.5% were between 31 and 40 years old, 33.1% were between 41 and 50 years old, 18.2% were between 51 and 60 years old, and 7.5% were 60 years and above. 85.4% of histopathological findings consisted of normal breast tissue and nonproliferative breast lesion breast lesions.

Men are twice as likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer, which largely reflects differences in tobacco consumption, although women may be more susceptible due to higher proportions of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and the effects of oestrogen. African American men in the US are at the highest risk of lung cancer. Family history increases risk by 1.7-fold, with a greater risk among first-degree relatives. Tobacco smoking is the greatest preventable cause of death worldwide, accounting for up to 90% of lung cancer cases, and continued consumption is projected to increase global cancer incidence, particularly in developing nations such as China, Russia, and India. Second-hand smoke among children and spouses has likewise been implicated. Radon from natural underground uranium decay is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the developed world.

A behavior was defined as unhealthy if patients failed to meet PA recommendations (≥10 metabolic equivalent task hours per week), reduce/quit tobacco, or decrease alcohol consumption to less than daily, or if they gained substantial weight over time. Multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equations explored associations with unhealthy behaviors.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, 41.7% of patients were inactive, 18.2% currently used tobacco, 14.6% consumed alcohol daily, and 48.9% were overweight or obese. At years 1 and 2, unhealthy PA behavior was reported among 37.0% and 35.6% of patients, respectively, unhealthy tobacco use behavior was reported among 11.4% and 9.5%, respectively, and unhealthy alcohol behavior was reported among 13.1% and 12.6%, respectively.

Some of these lipids interact with proteins on the cell membrane and acts as second messengers. The level of lipid mediators is generally maintained in the cell by feedback mechanisms; however, their improper degradation or enhanced production leads to their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment and disturbs the homeostasis of the cell. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a known phospholipid mediator secreted upon immunological challenges by platelets, neutrophils, basophils, and macrophages. PAF, as a potent inflammatory molecule, is well studied, and its role in various cancers and cardiovascular diseases has also been investigated. Interestingly, increased levels of PAF have been found in the blood plasma of smokers, and breast cancer cells have shown the accumulation of PAF in presence of cigarette smoke extract. This accumulation was found to increase tumor cell motility that in turn could promote metastasis. Beyond this, however, the effect of PAF on tumorigenesis has not yet been well explored. Here, we show that the continuous exposure of 3D breast acinar cultures to PAF resulted in the activation of various oncogenic signaling pathways leading to transformation. We also found that the presence of PAF in the micro-environment increased the expression of PAF receptor (PAF-R), which corroborated with the higher expression of PAF-R detected in some epithelial cancers, as per literature. Thus, this study impresses on the fact that the presence of PAF alters the cellular microenvironment and eventually triggers irreversible effects that can cumulatively lead to transformation.","2021",,"Front Genet",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The underlying molecular mechanisms of breast cancer require elucidation, particularly epigenetics, which is recognized as a molecular sensor to environmental exposures.
PURPOSE: We aim to explore whether DNA methylation levels of AHRR (marker of cigarette smoking), SLC1A5 and TXLNA (markers of alcohol consumption), and LINE-1 (a genome-wide repetitive retrotransposon) can act as molecular mediators underlying putative associations between breast cancer risk and pertinent extrinsic (tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and intrinsic factors [age and body mass index (BMI)].
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional pilot study which includes breast cancer cases (N = 65) and controls (N = 54). DNA methylation levels were measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing on available peripheral blood samples (N = 119), and Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) was used to impute missing DNA methylation values in remaining samples. Multiple mediation analysis was performed to assess direct and indirect (via DNA methylation) effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on breast cancer risk.
RESULTS: In relation to exposure, AHRR hypo-methylation was associated with cigarette but not waterpipe smoking, suggesting potentially different biomarkers of these two forms of tobacco use; SLC1A5 and TXLNA methylation were not associated with alcohol consumption; LINE-1 methylation was inversely associated with BMI (β-value [95% confidence interval (CI)] = -0.04 [-0.07, -0.02]), which remained significant after adjustment for age, smoking and alcohol consumption. In relation to breast cancer, there was no detectable association between AHRR, SLC1A5 or TXLNA methylation and cancer risk, but LINE-1 methylation was significantly higher in breast cancer cases when compared to controls (mean ± SD: 72.00 ± 0.66 versus 70.89 ± 0.73, P = 4.67 × 10

METHODS: We analyzed patients who were operated on with and without robotic assistance (R-NSM or C-NSM) and who received immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) with implant or latissimus dorsi-flap (LDF). The main objective was complication rate and secondary aims were post-operative length of hospitalization (POLH), duration of surgery, and cost.
RESULTS: We analyzed 87 R-NSM and 142 C-NSM with implant-IBR in 50 and 135 patients, with LDF-IBR in 37 and 7 patients, respectively. Higher durations of surgery and costs were observed for R-NSM, without a difference in POLH and interval time to adjuvant therapy between R-NSM and C-NSM. In the multivariate analysis, R-NSM was not associated with a higher breast complication rate (OR=0.608) and significant factors were breast cup-size, LDF combined with implant-IBR, tobacco and inversed-T incision. Grade 2-3 breast complications rate were 13% for R-NSM and 17.3% for C-NSM, significantly higher for LDF combined with implant-IBR, areolar/radial incisions and BMI>=30. A predictive score was calculated (AUC=0.754). In logistic regression, patient's satisfaction between C-NSM and R-NSM were not significantly different, with unfavorable results for BMI >=25 (OR=2.139), NSM for recurrence (OR=5.371) and primary breast cancer with radiotherapy (OR=4.533).

These tumors are increasingly diagnosed despite their rare occurrence rate. The term synchronous tumors is applied if two different tumors originating in the same patient are detected at the same time or within six months; if the second tumor is detected beyond six months, it is called metachronous. Aetiological factors that may predispose patients to MPMNs have been grouped into three broad categories: familial cancer syndromes and other genetic susceptibility factors, common exposures (e.g. tobacco), and carcinogenic effects of cancer treatment. The likelihood of missing asymptomatic synchronous tumors at the time of diagnosis is due to a lack of definitively set guidelines for synchronous tumors. Studying every individual case may aid us in understanding disease biology, developing diagnostic guidelines, and establishing patient-specific management strategies.

There is enigma regarding its dual role in cancer, the tumor-progressing or tumor-suppressing effects depending on the site to which it localizes in the cell. The current study aimed to detect Filamin A expression in breast cancer and its association with other biomarkers and other clinicopathological parameters and established risk factors in breast cancer so that it can be a potential site for targeted therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred female patients of histologically proven breast cancer who presented to our hospital over a 2-year period were included in the study. None of the patients received prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. Patients with recurrent breast cancer are not included in the study. All study cases are subjected to immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Her2 neu, and ki-67 from core biopsy tissue of cases diagnosed as breast carcinoma. Tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with anti-Filamin A.
RESULTS: Filamin A is expressed in 69% of cases of invasive breast cancer in our study. There was no statistically significant relationship of Filamin A immunoexpression with histological grade, age, parity, oral contraceptive use, smokeless tobacco use, TNM staging, clinical staging, clinical prognostic staging, and also ER, PR, Her2 neu, and ki-67 status (
CONCLUSION: No significant correlation could be found between Filamin A expression and clinicopathological parameters in our study. The cytoplasmic expression is seen in malignant cells as well as normal breast and benign tumor sections implicating the dual role of Filamin A in breast cancer.

We also focused on pancreatic cancer and female lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained cancer death certifications and population data from the World Health Organization and Eurostat databases for 1970-2015. We predicted numbers of deaths and age-standardised (world population) rates for 2021 for total cancers and 10 major cancer sites, using a joinpoint regression model. We calculated the number of avoided deaths over the period 1989-2021.
RESULTS: We predicted 1 267 000 cancer deaths for 2021 in the EU, corresponding to age-standardised rates of 130.4/100 000 men (-6.6% since 2015) and 81.0/100 000 for women (-4.5%). We estimated further falls in male lung cancer rates, but still trending upward in women by +6.5%, reaching 14.5/100 000 in 2021. The breast cancer predicted rate in the EU was 13.3/100 000 (-7.8%). The rates for stomach and leukaemias in both sexes and for bladder in males are predicted to fall by >10%; trends for other cancer sites were also favourable, except for the pancreas, which showed stable patterns in both sexes, with predicted rates of 8.1/100 000 in men and 5.6/100 000 in women. Rates for pancreatic cancer in EU men aged 25-49 and 50-64 years declined, respectively, by 10% and 1.8%, while for those aged 65+ years increased by 1.3%. Rates fell for young women only (-3.4%). Over 1989-2021, about 5 million cancer deaths were avoided in the EU27 compared with peak rates in 1988.
CONCLUSION: Overall cancer mortality continues to fall in both sexes. However, specific focus is needed on pancreatic cancer, which shows a sizeable decline for young men only.

METHODS: The estimates of incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted-life-years and risk factors of breast cancer in females in 49 Asian countries were retrieved from Global Burden of Disease 2019 study.
RESULTS: In Asia, female breast cancer incidence grew from 245 045[226 259-265 260] in 1990 to 914 878[815 789-1025 502] in 2019 with age-standardized incidence rate rising from 21.2/100 000[19.6-22.9] to 35.9/100 000[32.0-40.2] between 1990 and 2019. The death counts more than doubled from 136 665[126 094-148 380] to 337 822[301 454-375 251]. The age-standardized mortality rate rose marginally between 1990 and 2019 (1990: 12.1[11.0-13.1]; 2019: 13.4[12.0-14.9]). In 2019, age-standardized incidence rate varied from 17.2/100 000[13.95-21.4] in Mongolia to 122.5[92.1-160.7] in Lebanon and the age-standardized mortality rate varied 4-fold from 8.0/100 000 [7.2-8.8] in South Korea to 51.9[39.0-69.8] in Pakistan. High body mass index (5.6%), high fasting plasma glucose (5.6%) and secondhand smoke (3.5%) were the main contributory risk factors to all-age disability-adjusted-life-years due to breast cancer in Asia.

The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against screening pelvic examinations. The USPSTF recommendations for women in this age group include screening for obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors, depression, intimate partner violence, cervical cancer, HIV, hepatitis C virus, tobacco use, and unhealthy alcohol and drug use as part of routine primary care. Breast cancer screening with mammography is recommended for women 50 years and older and should be individualized for women 40 to 49 years of age, although other organizations recommend earlier screening. Screening for sexually transmitted infections is based on age and risk factors; women younger than 25 years who are sexually active should be screened routinely for gonorrhea and chlamydia, whereas screening for syphilis and hepatitis B virus should be individualized. Immunizations should be recommended according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; immunizations against influenza; tetanus; measles, mumps, and rubella; varicella; meningococcus; and human papillomavirus are of particular importance in women of reproductive age.

RECENT FINDINGS: Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have an approximately 50% increased risk of death by cancer compared to age and sex-matched people in the general population. Studies have confirmed an increased mortality from breast, lung and colon cancer in patients with schizophrenia.Analyses of incidence of cancer revealed contradicting results, with some studies showing no increase in incidence and others a modestly increased incidence in overall cancer. Studies of incidence of specific types of cancers showed modestly increased risk of pancreas, oesophagus, breast cancer and contradicting results regarding lung cancer.In studies identified that compared to the general population, patients with schizophrenia were at an increased risk of not being diagnosed or treated for cancer before death of cancer. In addition, patients with schizophrenia had lower chances of getting optimal treatment for colon cancer after diagnosis.
SUMMARY: This review indicates that patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of dying of cancer and of several specific types of cancer. This increased mortality can be reduced if the price of tobacco is increased, if smoking cessation programmes are offered systematically, screening programs better implemented in this highly vulnerable group, and if procedures to facilitate access to early diagnosis and effective treatment are implemented.","2021",,"Curr Opin Psychiatry"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : On the basis of articles published in 2018 , 2019 and 2020 , the first aim of this review is to present estimates of incidence rates and excess mortality of overall cancer and organ-specific cancers for patients with schizophrenia compared with the general population"," review","Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Schizophrenia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Smoking Cessation, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

There is a paucity of evidence on the risk factors of breast cancer in Ethiopia. Therefore, we aimed to identify the risk factors of breast cancer among women in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: We conducted an institutional-based unmatched case-control study with a sample of 348 women (116 cases and 232 controls). Participants were selected by a systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were entered using EpiData version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Multivariable analysis was carried out using the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

In this study, we demonstrate that chronic exposure of nicotine plays a critical role in the formation of pre-metastatic niche within the lungs by recruiting pro-tumor N2-neutrophils. This pre-metastatic niche promotes the release of STAT3-activated lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a secretory glycoprotein from the N2-neutrophils, and induces mesenchymal-epithelial transition of tumor cells thereby facilitating colonization and metastatic outgrowth. Elevated levels of serum and urine LCN2 is elevated in early-stage breast cancer patients and cancer-free females with smoking history, suggesting that LCN2 serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for predicting increased risk of metastatic disease in female smoker(s). Moreover, natural compound, salidroside effectively abrogates nicotine-induced neutrophil polarization and consequently reduced lung metastasis of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer cells.

The signatures of these mutational processes can be identified in large genomic datasets. We investigated the hypothesis that genomic patterns of mutational signatures are associated with the clinical behavior of breast cancer, in particular chemotherapy response and survival, with a particular focus on therapy-resistant disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was carried out in 405 pretherapeutic samples from the prospective neoadjuvant multicenter GeparSepto study. We analyzed 11 mutational signatures including biological processes such as APOBEC-mutagenesis, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), mismatch repair deficiency and also age-related or tobacco-induced alterations.
RESULTS: Different subgroups of breast carcinomas were defined mainly by differences in HRD-related and APOBEC-related mutational signatures and significant differences between hormone-receptor (HR)-negative and HR-positive tumors as well as correlations with age, Ki-67 and immunological parameters were observed. We could identify mutational processes that were linked to increased pathological complete response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with high significance. In univariate analyses for HR-positive tumors signatures, S3 (HRD, P < 0.001) and S13 (APOBEC, P = 0.001) as well as exonic mutation rate (P = 0.002) were significantly correlated with increased pathological complete response rates. The signatures S3 (HRD, P = 0.006) and S4 (tobacco, P = 0.011) were prognostic for reduced disease-free survival of patients with chemotherapy-resistant tumors.
CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation suggest that the clinical behavior of a tumor, in particular, response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and disease-free survival of therapy-resistant tumors, could be predicted by the composition of mutational signatures as an indicator of the individual genomic history of a tumor. After additional validations, mutational signatures might be used to identify tumors with an increased response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to define therapy-resistant subgroups for future therapeutic interventions.","2021",,"Ann Oncol"," We investigated the hypothesis that genomic patterns of mutational signatures are associated with the clinical behavior of breast cancer , in particular chemotherapy response and survival , with a particular focus on therapy-resistant disease ","other","Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, drug therapy, Q000188, Humans, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE, Neoadjuvant Therapy, TRUE, Prognosis, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: Data from the New York State Cancer Registry for 10,444 women diagnosed with breast cancer from 2004 to 2016 and aged <65 years at diagnosis were linked with Medicaid claims. Women were categorized as having depression or a severe mental illness (SMI) if they had at least three relevant diagnosis claims with at least one claim within three years prior to breast cancer diagnosis. SMI included schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other psychotic disorders. Estimated menopausal status was determined by age (premenopausal age <50; postmenopausal age ≥50). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated with Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Preexisting SMI was associated with greater all-cause (HR = 1.36; 95%CI 1.18, 1.57) and cancer-specific (HR = 1.21; 95%CI 1.03, 1.44) mortality compared to those with no mental illnesses. No association was observed between preexisting depression and mortality. Among racial/ethnic subgroups, the association between SMI and all-cause mortality was observed among non-Hispanic white (HR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.19, 1.83) and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (HR = 2.59; 95% 1.15, 5.87) women. Additionally, mortality hazards were greatest among women with preexisting SMI that were postmenopausal (HR = 1.49; 95%CI 1.25, 1.78), obese (HR = 1.58; 95%CI 1.26, 1.98), and had documented tobacco use (HR = 1.42; 95%CI 1.13, 1.78).

Giant breast hamartoma (GMH) is very rare and can reach unexpected sizes in women.
PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: A 26 year old Egyptian female presented with left breast lump since 3 years, gradually increasing in size, with no other associated complaints. No family history of breast cancer, she did not smoke or consume alcohol, and had no past medical history. Examination revealed a large soft freely mobile mass (12 × 9 cm) in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast at the 3-6 o'clock position. There were no palpable axillary lymph nodes in both sides. Nipples and right breast were normal.
DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of GMH can be made by examination and imaging only. The specific features that appear in mammogram and ultrasound can be used to reduce the need for core biopsy in hamartoma. Wide local excision is curative. We include a review of the literature of cases of GMH > 10 cm published during the last 15 years.
CONCLUSION: A non-invasive mammogram and ultrasound provide sufficient evidence of the tumour, hence core biopsy might not be critically required. However, if a breast hamartoma is still clinically suspected but with inconclusive or unequivocal mammographic and ultrasonographic features or if there is suspicion of dysplasia, then invasive core biopsy is justified.

,"33353068","A Step Forward in Breast Cancer Research: From a Natural-Like Experimental Model to a Preliminary Photothermal Approach.","Costa E","Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies and common causes of cancer death in women. Recent studies suggest that environmental exposures to certain chemicals, such as 7,12-Dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), a chemical present in tobacco, may increase the risk of developing breast cancer later in life. The first-line treatments for breast cancer (surgery, chemotherapy or a combination of both) are generally invasive and frequently associated with severe side effects and high comorbidity. Consequently, novel approaches are strongly required to find more natural-like experimental models that better reflect the tumors' etiology, physiopathology and response to treatments, as well as to find more targeted, efficient and minimally invasive treatments. This study proposes the development and an in deep biological characterization of an experimental model using DMBA-tumor-induction in Sprague-Dawley female rats. Moreover, a photothermal therapy approach using a near-infrared laser coupled with gold nanoparticles was preliminarily assessed. The gold nanoparticles were functionalized with Epidermal Growth Factor, and their physicochemical properties and in vitro effects were characterized. DMBA proved to be a very good and selective inductor of breast cancer, with 100% incidence and inducing an average of 4.7 tumors per animal. Epigenetic analysis showed that tumors classified with worst prognosis were hypomethylated. The tumor-induced rats were then subjected to a preliminary treatment using functionalized gold nanoparticles and its activation by laser (650-900 nm). The treatment outcomes presented very promising alterations in terms of tumor histology, confirming the presence of necrosis in most of the cases. Although this study revealed encouraging results as a breast cancer therapy, it is important to define tumor eligibility and specific efficiency criteria to further assess its application in breast cancer treatment on other species.","2020",,"Int J Mol Sci",,"other","5-Methylcytosine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, 9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Animals, FALSE, Body Weight, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gold, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Hyperthermia, Induced, TRUE, Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Metal Nanoparticles, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Models, Theoretical, TRUE, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: Patients with early-stage breast cancer were identified from the electronic record and institutional registry. Lymphocyte and monocyte counts were obtained from blood samples at time of diagnosis prior to any chemotherapy. Correlations between lymphocyte and monocyte and recurrence were assessed in the entire cohort and among obese patients, those reporting alcohol consumption and smoking. Competing risk regression was used to analyze time to recurrence.
RESULTS: A total of 950 patients with ≥ 5 years of follow-up were identified; 433 had complete data and were eligible for analysis. 293 (68%) had hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 82 (19%) HER2 positive, and 53 (13%) triple negative. Patients in the highest quintile of lymphocytes compared to the lowest quintile had lower risk of recurrence (subhazard ratio (SHR) = 0.17, 95% CI [0.03-0.93], p = 0.041) while patients in the highest quintile of monocytes had lower risk for recurrence (SHR = 0.19, 95% CI [0.04, 0.92], p = 0.039). Higher monocytes were more strongly associated with lower recurrence among those reporting alcohol consumption (HR = 0.10, 95% CI [0.01, 0.91], p = 0.04). In obese patients, higher lymphocytes were associated with lower risk of recurrence (p = 0.046); in non-obese patients, higher monocytes were associated with lower risk of recurrence (p = 0.02).

Eliminating or mitigating cancer risk factors by adopting healthy behaviors and lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco and alcohol use, exercising, eating a healthy diet, and applying sunscreen to protect against UV exposure, belongs to primary prevention and is the easiest and most effective way of preventing cancer for the general public. Secondary prevention includes screening to identify precancerous lesions and taking intervention measures to prevent disease progression to malignancy. Tertiary prevention refers to reducing or controlling the symptoms and morbidity of established cancer or the morbidity caused by cancer therapy. For high-risk populations, chemopreventive agents, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (including tamoxifan and raloxifene) in breast cancer prevention and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin) in colorectal cancer prevention, and immunoprevention using human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus vaccines in infection-related cancers have shown clear clinical benefits of reducing cancer incidences.

Energy restriction might be cancer protective, while malnutrition, vomiting, laxative and substance use might stimulate cancer development. We examined whether individuals with an eating disorder (not restricted to anorexia nervosa) had a different risk of developing cancer.
METHODS: A systematic search on Medline and Embase until 28th April 2020 identified relevant human original research publications, including all populations and all cancer types.
RESULTS: From 990 records, 6 case reports and 9 cohorts were included. Some cohorts found a decreased breast (3/5 studies) or cervical (1/2) cancer risk, while an increased esophageal (2/3), liver (1/1), brain (1/1 in men) and respiratory (2/4) cancer risk, but other cancer risks were non-significant, and an increased mortality overall (1/2), from breast (1/1), female genital (1/1) and skin (1/1) cancer in eating disorder patients. The case reports further described esophageal cancer and leukemia. No clear statistical differences in cancer risk were found depending on eating disorder type, perhaps due to the small sample size (n = 1783 for other than anorexia nervosa).

Due to the inconsistent cancer registry system in Saudi Arabia, the epidemiology of cancer is still dispersed in the country. Consequently, this review aimed to assemble the epidemiological metrics of cancer in Saudi Arabia in light of the available published data during the period from (2010-2019).
METHODS: Published literature from Saudi Arabia relating to cancer incidence, prevalence, risk factors, and other epidemiological metrics were accessed through electronic search in Medline/PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and public database that meet the inclusion criteria. Relevant keywords were used during the electronic search about different types of cancers in Saudi Arabia. No filters were used during the electronic searches. Data were pooled and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to assess the well-determined risk factors associated with different types of cancers.
RESULTS: The most common cancers in Saudi Arabia are breast, colorectal, prostate, brain, lymphoma, kidney and thyroid outnumbering respectively. Their prevalence rates and OR (95%CI) as follow: breast cancer 53% and 0.93 (0.84-1.00); colon-rectal cancer (CRC) 50.9% and 1.2 (0.81-1.77); prostate cancer 42.6% and 3.2 (0.88-31.11); brain/Central Nervous System cancer 9.6% and 2.3 (0.01-4.2); Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 9.2% and 3.02 (1.48-6.17); kidney cancer 4.6% and 2.05 (1.61-2.61), and thyroid cancer 12.9% and 6.77 (2.34-19.53).

However, clinical trials often underrepresent those at highest risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD)related outcomes and have limited generalizability to the larger breast cancer population. In addition, racial differences in treatment-associated CVD mortality have yet to be explored. In this study, we sought to quantify the relationship between breast cancer therapies and CVD mortality, and explore whether this effect differed between non-Hispanic black (NHB) and white (NHW) women.
METHODS: Using data from the Georgia Cancer Registry, we identified women diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer [2010-2014], residing in the metropolitan Atlanta area (n=3,580 NHB; n=4,923 NHW), and followed them for mortality through December 31, 2018. Exposures of interest included therapies with potential cardiotoxic effects including chemotherapy and hormone therapy, which are routinely collected by the GCR. Individual agents are not captured within the GCR, therefore trastuzumab was identified using natural language processing of textual descriptions. We used propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between each treatment modality and CVD mortality among the overall cohort and by race.
RESULTS: In the overall cohort, similar hazards of CVD mortality were found among women treated with chemotherapy (HR =1.10, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.96) and hormone therapy (HR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.50), compared to women who did not receive the respective treatments. In contrast, women treated with trastuzumab had a higher hazard of CVD mortality compared to women not treated with trastuzumab (HR =2.05, 95% CI: 0.76, 5.52). In race-specific models, hormone therapy was associated with a higher hazard of CVD mortality among NHB women (HR =2.18, 95% CI: 0.78, 6.12), but not NHW women (HR =0.66, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.13). Similar, albeit attenuated, associations were found for chemotherapy. We were unable to investigate race-specific effects of trastuzumab due to low prevalence and insufficient number of events.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we observed more pronounced associations of chemotherapy and hormone therapy with CVD mortality among NHB women, for whom we know have greater CVD-related comorbidities at breast cancer diagnosis. Patients may benefit from treatment plans that find a balance between curative breast cancer treatment and prevention of CVD-related events and mortality.

The right breast was evidently tumor-free, and the patient had no family history of breast cancer. Reconstruction was performed 22 months postmastectomy. The split-breast free flap was based on the right internal mammary artery (IMA) perforator and harvested during the right-sided breast reduction. Microsurgical anastomosis was performed on the IMA perforator on the left side. Mastopexy was performed on the right side and the nipple-areola complex (NAC) was transferred to its new position as a free graft to complete the breast reduction. A tattoo of the left NAC was performed 4 months postreconstruction. There was complete flap survival with a pleasant cosmetic result. Split breast reconstruction could be an alternative to more common procedures. However, this approach is only feasible in patients with hypertrophic contralateral breast and absence of risk factors for developing a second primary breast cancer.","2021",,"Microsurgery",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Anastomosis, Surgical, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, surgery, Q000601, Female, FALSE, Free Tissue Flaps, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Mammaplasty, TRUE, Mastectomy, FALSE, Nipples, FALSE, surgery, Q000601, Perforator Flap, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The incidence of cancer is increasing due to environmental changes and modernization of life style. Lung and breast cancer deaths lead in number compared to other cancer deaths. Although the cause of cancer due to external factors like tobacco use, chemicals, radiation, infectious organisms and internal factors like immune conditions and genetic modification are known, the occurrence and deaths due to cancer cannot be controlled.
METHODS: It is expected that the incidence of cancer after two decades will increase by 70% and the death rate will also increase by 50%, which is an alarming situation globally. Although synthetic compounds are being used in the control of cancer as chemopreventive agents, about 50% of these are related to natural products as the origin. There is an emerging evidence to show that in the past 50 years, natural products derived from plants and marine sources had beneficial effects in the treatment and prevention of cancer. Taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, cytarabine, eribulin mesylate and trabectidine are some of the anti-cancer compounds isolated from terrestrial and marine sources.
RESULTS: This review highlights mainly the role of natural compounds isolated from terrestrial and marine sources as anti-cancer agents through the docking of these compounds with the related macromolecular targets.

,"32897160","Identification of Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer Who Need Supplemental Screening.","Eriksson M","Background Mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality, but a proportion of breast cancers are missed and are detected at later stages or develop during between-screening intervals. Purpose To develop a risk model based on negative mammograms that identifies women likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer before or at the next screening examination. Materials and Methods This study was based on the prospective screening cohort Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (KARMA), 2011-2017. An image-based risk model was developed by using the Stratus method and computer-aided detection mammographic features (density, masses, microcalcifications), differences in the left and right breasts, and age. The lifestyle extended model included menopausal status, family history of breast cancer, body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, and use of tobacco and alcohol. The genetic extended model included a polygenic risk score with 313 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Age-adjusted relative risks and tumor subtype specific risks were estimated by using logistic regression, and absolute risks were calculated. Results Of 70 877 participants in the KARMA cohort, 974 incident cancers were sampled from 9376 healthy women (mean age, 54 years ± 10 [standard deviation]). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the image-based model was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, 0.74). The AUCs for the lifestyle and genetic extended models were 0.74 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.75) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.79), respectively. There was a relative eightfold difference in risk between women at high risk and those at general risk. High-risk women were more likely to be diagnosed with stage II cancers and with tumors 20 mm or larger and were less likely to have stage I and estrogen receptor-positive tumors. The image-based model was validated in three external cohorts. Conclusion By combining three mammographic features, differences in the left and right breasts, and optionally lifestyle factors and family history and a polygenic risk score, the model identified women at high likelihood of being diagnosed with breast cancer within 2 years of a negative screening examination and in possible need of supplemental screening. © RSNA, 2020 ","2020",,"Radiology"," Purpose To develop a risk model based on negative mammograms that identifies women likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer before or at the next screening examination ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Diagnosis, Differential, FALSE, Diagnostic Errors, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Life Style, FALSE, Mammography, FALSE, Mass Screening, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

What is the role of breast cancer type 1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) polymorphism in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? What is the main finding and its importance? Variant rs10744996C>A of BRIP1 increases the susceptibility of the Mongolian population to COPD. The expression of BRIP1 was significantly reduced in cigarette smoke extract-treated airway epithelial cells.
ABSTRACT: Cigarette smoke is a major environmental pollutant that can induce DNA damage in humans. The development and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are known to be related to the impairment of DNA repair. Breast cancer type 1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) plays an important role in DNA interstrand crosslink repair and double-strand break repair. However, the role of BRIP1 polymorphisms in COPD has not been previously described. In this study, whole genome sequencing was used to identify mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was used to verify the selected SNPs. In addition the BRIP1 expression levels in 16HBE and A549 airway epithelial cells treated with or without cigarette smoke extract (CSE) were measured using western blotting and RT-qPCR. Rs10744996C>A in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of BRIP1 was then genotyped in 1296 COPD cases and 988 healthy control subjects from a Mongolian population in northern China. Significant differences in the distribution of rs10744996C>A variants between COPD and control groups (P = 0.001) were identified. Rs10744996C>A was found to be associated with significantly increased COPD risk (adjusted odds ratio = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.30-1.98, P < 0.0001). Additionally, rs10744996A genotype was found to interact with a family history of cancer and a history of x-ray exposure (P = 0.028 and 0.009, respectively). BRIP1 expression levels in 16HBE and A549 cells treated with CSE were significantly lower compared to the control treated cells. The rs10744996C>A variant of BRIP1 increased the COPD susceptibility of the Mongolian population cohort. BRIP1 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly reduced in conjunction with CSE-induced DNA damage in 16HBE and A549 cells.","2020",,"Exp Physiol",,"other","A549 Cells, FALSE, China, FALSE, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, TRUE, ethnology, Q000208, RNA Helicases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, RNA, Messenger, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Smoke, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We investigated association of food desert residence and cancer outcomes.
METHODS: In this population-based study, data from the 2000-2012 California Cancer Registry was used to identify patients with stage II/III breast or colorectal cancer. Patient residence at time of diagnosis was linked by census tract to food desert using the USDA Food Access Research Atlas. Treatment and outcomes were compared by food desert residential status.
RESULTS: Among 64,987 female breast cancer patients identified, 66.8% were < 65 years old, and 5.7% resided in food deserts. Five-year survival for food desert residents was 78% compared with 80% for non-desert residents (p < 0.0001). Among 48,666 colorectal cancer patients identified, 50.4% were female, 39% were > 65 years old, and 6.4% resided in food deserts. Five-year survival for food desert residents was 60% compared with 64% for non-desert residents (p < 0.001). Living in food deserts was significantly associated with diabetes, tobacco use, poor insurance coverage, and low socioeconomic status (p < 0.05) for both cancers. There was no significant difference in rates of surgery or chemotherapy by food desert residential status for either diagnosis. Multivariable analyses showed that food desert residence was associated with higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Survival, despite treatment for stage II/III breast and colorectal cancers was worse for those living in food deserts.

The epidemiology of tobacco use differs by race and ethnicity, and limited cessation research has been conducted in African American (AA) populations. Here, we assess demographic and clinical variables associated with continued smoking in AAs after a cancer diagnosis. The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors study is a cohort comprised of AA cancer survivors with breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors data were utilized from survivors who completed their baseline survey within 18 months of cancer diagnosis (n = 1145); 18% (n = 356) reported smoking at the time of cancer diagnosis, and 57% of these (n = 203) continued to smoke after their diagnosis. Logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with continued smoking. Living with a smoker (odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64, 4.70), higher cumulative years of smoking (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05, for each year), and a prostate cancer diagnosis (OR = 7.35, 95% CI: 3.89, 13.89) were all associated with increased odds of continued smoking. Survivors with higher social well-being scores (measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, a quality of life assessment) were more likely to quit smoking after diagnosis (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.00).

The purpose of this study is to describe the sociodemographic profile, toxic habits and diet profile of patients suffering from breast cancer treated in the Mohammed VI Cancer Treatment Center, in Casablanca.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 305 female patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer.
RESULTS: The average age of patients was 50 years; Fifty-six percent (55.7%) of patients were married and 12.8% were widows. Among the surveyed women, 83% were housewives, 63.3% lived in an urban environment and 47.9% were illiterate. With respect to patients' toxic habits, only 5,9% of the surveyed women reported that they had consumed alcohol and a minority of them reported they were ex-smokers or smokers (4.3% and 2.3%respectively). With respect to diet, our patients consumed bread and red meat with an average frequency of 8.26 and 5.84 times/week respectively and, finally, dairy products with an average frequency ranging from 3.55 to 4.57 times/week. In addition, patients mostly consumed potatoes and fresh fruit, with an average frequency of 5.74 and 5.38 times/week respectively. Tea was the most widely consumed beverage, with a very high average frequency of 8.12 times/week.
CONCLUSION: Given our results, most of the surveyed women were housewives, illiterate women and resided in an urban environment. Many foods were frequently consumed by our patients.

,"32760866","Smoking history and cessation discussions in cancer patients receiving definitive radiotherapy: Do we treat all patients equally?","Holland JM","INTRODUCTION: Tobacco is recognized as a causative agent for head and neck (H&N) and lung cancers, but not for cancers of the prostate or breast. Still, tobacco use during radiotherapy has been associated with poorer outcomes for all four of these commonly treated malignancies. We sought to evaluate if our providers record smoking history and discuss cessation as frequently for prostate and breast cancers as for H&N and lung cancers.
METHODS: Initial consultation notes of 592 non-metastatic patients seen from January 2014 through June 2017 were reviewed using the electronic medical record. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate smoking history and cessation discussions. The chi-squared test was used to compare frequencies. We chose two cancer sites commonly associated with tobacco use and causation (H&N and lung) and two sites not commonly associated (prostate and breast).
RESULTS: Prostate cancer patients were less likely to have smoking history recorded (65%) than breast (91%), H&N (96%) or lung (97%) patients (p<0.0001). Breast and prostate cancer patients were less likely to be current smokers (10%) than H&N and lung cancer patients (29%) (p<0.0001). Smoking cessation discussions were less frequently documented in breast and prostate cancer patients (14%) than in H&N and lung cancer patients (55%) (p=0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: We document smoking history less frequently for prostate cancer patients than H&N, lung or breast cancer patients. Breast and prostate cancer patients have lower rates of current smoking than H&N and lung cancer patients. We document smoking cessation discussions less frequently in current smoking breast and prostate cancer patients than current smoking H&N and lung cancer patients. As all of these patients have been shown to experience poorer outcomes when smoking during radiotherapy, all should be asked about their smoking history.","2020",,"Tob Prev Cessat"," We sought to evaluate if our providers record smoking history and discuss cessation as frequently for prostate and breast cancers as for H & N and lung cancers ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Open and closed-ended questions were used to assess unprompted and prompted cancer awareness in relation to the respondents' demographic profile, alcohol consumption and use of tobacco. Unprompted, 22.2% of respondents were aware of the link between alcohol and cancer, whereas prompted 44.8% were aware of this. When prompted about specific cancer types, 39.5% were aware of the fact that alcohol increases the risk of liver cancer and only 9.6% were aware of the link between alcohol and breast cancer. Being aware of the link between alcohol and cancer was associated with being female, having a higher level of education, living in the Capital Region of Denmark, as well as being a non-smoker. There were no statistical significant associations between awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer and the respondents' age, marital status and alcohol consumption.

METHODS: Incidence rates in Bangkok were derived as the mean annual number of new cancer cases per 100,000 inhabitants for the period 2011-2015 stratified by 5-year age group and sex. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were calculated using the world standard population.
RESULTS: The five most frequent cancers in Bangkok correspond to close to 60 % of the total burden in both males and females. In males, cancers of the lung, liver and colorectum each comprised 14-16 % of the burden, while breast cancer was responsible for three in 10 cancers in women (or 29.4 %), with colorectal and cervical cancer ranking second and third (10.0 % and 8.5 % respectively). respectively. Under three different scenarios of trends in all-cancer incidence rates, demographic changes mean that the incidence burden will rise over the next two decades.

,"32553370","Night shift work in resident physicians: does it affect mood states and cognitive levels?","Costa C","BACKGROUND: The effects of night shift work on health status have been widely studied. Night workers seem to smoke more, eat badly and show a low propensity to physical activity. Night work can be associated with an increase in cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders, alterations in immune response, diabetes, aging, hormonal imbalance, and premature death; alteration of circadian rhythm is also regarded as a risk factor for breast cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, several studies have highlighted the effects of sleep deprivation on clinical performance, quality of care and personal safety of healthcare personnel. No studies have investigated the effects of night work on Italian resident physicians and compared its effect across specialties. This study aims to assess the prevalence of sleep disorders, possible cognitive impairment and mood states, in relation to night shift work among resident physicians.
METHODS: 80 resident physicians, attending the postgraduate training into an Hospital located in the South of Italy, were divided into 4 areas (medical, surgical, services and anaesthesia). They were recruited from July 2017 to June 2018 and participated to a survey consisting of 4 questionnaires to investigate the presence of sleep deprivation and sleep quality (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), their cognitive status (Mini Mental State examination) and mood profiles (Profile of Mood States, POMS). Analysis of variance was used for comparison of questionnaires scores across specialties.
RESULTS: Authors reported no sleep deprivation, no sleep disorders and their outcomes, no changes in intellectual efficiency and no cognitive impairment in this population, neither in the areas performing night shifts nor in those involving only day shifts. Mood states measured by POMS showed a borderline level of Anger-Hostility (A) value among the residents of the medical area and services, and an increase slightly beyond the physiological levels of the T-score 50 of Fatigue-Inertia (F) always in the same groups. An increase in the Vigour-Activity (V) value beyond T-score 50 levels was also observed among residents of all the areas considered.
CONCLUSIONS: Emotional involvement could be attributed to the gap between high professional demand and lack of experience and knowledge among trainees.

METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Registry of all new cases of invasive cancer from twelve sites diagnosed in 2002-2015 was analyzed. Age-standardized rates were calculated. Trends of incidence rates were analyzed using joinpoint regression models.
RESULTS: For both, men and women, incidence rates trends for all cancer sites, colo-rectal and bladder cancer remained stable. Esophageal and gastric cancers descended while thyroid and kidney cancer incidence increased. In men lung cancer decreased; testicular cancer increased, and prostate cancer increased at the beginning of the period and decreased in the final years. In women, lung cancer increased, breast cancer remained stable and cervical cancer presented a significant decline from 2005 to 2010 and reached a plateau since then.

On univariate analyses, higher V32.5-47.5 Gy (P < .05) and larger breast volume (P < .01) were predictive of any fat necrosis; higher V35-50 Gy (P < .05), receiving 2 treatments on consecutive days (P = .02), and higher Dmax (P = .01) were predictive of painful fat necrosis. On multivariate analyses, breast volume larger than 1063 cm
CONCLUSIONS: Early-stage breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving surgery and S-PBI in our study had a fat necrosis rate comparable to other accelerated partial breast irradiation modalities, but S-PBI is less invasive. To reduce risk of painful fat necrosis, we recommend not delivering fractions on consecutive days; limiting V42.5 < 50 cm","2020",,"Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys"," PURPOSE : This study reports predictive dosimetric and physiologic factors for fat necrosis after stereotactic-partial breast irradiation ( S-PBI ) ","clinical trial","Aged, FALSE, Analysis of Variance, FALSE, Breast, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Dose Fractionation, Radiation, FALSE, Fat Necrosis, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Organ Size, FALSE, Radiosurgery, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Radiotherapy Dosage, FALSE, Regression Analysis, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE","breast volume","Phase 1",1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The aim of this work is to estimate the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from breast cancer attributable to these two risk factors in the European Union (EU-28) in 2017. The comparative risk assessment method was used. Data on prevalence of smoking and SHS exposure were extracted from the Eurobarometer surveys, relative risks from a recent meta-analysis, and data on mortality and DALYs from breast cancer were estimated from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors Study. In 2017, 82 239 DALYs and 3354 deaths from breast cancer in the EU-28 could have been avoided by removing exposure to these two risk factors (smoking and SHS exposure). The proportion of DALYs from breast cancer lost respectively from smoking and SHS exposure was 2.6% and 1.0%, although geographically distributed with significant heterogeneity. These results represent the first estimates of breast cancer burden in women attributable to smoking and SHS exposure for the EU-28. It is important to increase awareness among women, health professionals and wider society of the association between smoking, SHS exposure and breast cancer, a relationship that is not widely recognised or discussed.","2020",,"Int J Cancer"," The aim of this work is to estimate the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs ) from breast cancer attributable to these two risk factors in the European Union ( EU-28 ) in 2017 ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cost of Illness, TRUE, Disabled Persons, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Europe, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, European Union, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Female, FALSE, Global Burden of Disease, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Risk Factors, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

To date, regional differences in breast cancer risk factors have not been identified. The aim of our review was to gain a better understanding of the role of risk factors in women with breast cancer in Asia.
METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search on 15 March 2016, for journal articles published in English between 2011 and 2016, which reported data for human subjects in Asia with a diagnosis of breast cancer. Search terms included breast neoplasm, epidemiology, Asia, prevalence, incidence, risk and cost of illness. Studies of any design were included, except for review articles and meta-analyses, which were excluded to avoid duplication of data. No exclusions were made based on breast cancer treatment. We reported the results using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 776 abstracts were retrieved. After screening against the eligibility criteria, 562 abstracts were excluded. The remaining 214 abstracts, which were published between 2013 and 2015, were included in this review. Results were summarized and reported under three categories: incidence, prevalence or outcomes for breast cancer in Asia; modifiable risk factors; and non-modifiable risk factors. We found that the increased risk of breast cancer among participants from Asia was associated with older age, family history of breast cancer, early menarche, late menopause, high body mass index, being obese or overweight, exposure to tobacco smoke, and high dietary intake of fats or fatty foods. In contrast, intake of dietary fruits, vegetables, and plant- and soy-based products was associated with a decreased breast cancer risk. While based on limited data, when compared to women from the United States, women from Asia had a decreased risk of breast cancer.

We estimated mortality counts and rates for 2020 in the European Union (EU) and for its six most populous countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained cancer death certification and population data from the World Health Organization and Eurostat databases for 1970-2015. We estimated projections to 2020 for 10 major cancer sites plus all neoplasms and calculated the number of avoided deaths over 1989-2020.
RESULTS: Total cancer mortality rates in the EU are predicted to decline reaching 130.1/100 000 men (-5.4% since 2015) and 82.2 in women (-4.1%) in 2020. The predicted number of deaths will increase by 4.7% reaching 1 428 800 in 2020. In women, the upward lung cancer trend is predicted to continue with a rate in 2020 of 15.1/100 000 (higher than that for breast cancer, 13.5) while in men we predicted further falls. Pancreatic cancer rates are also increasing in women (+1.2%) but decreasing in men (-1.9%). In the EU, the prostate cancer predicted rate is 10.0/100 000, declining by 7.1% since 2015; decreases for this neoplasm are ∼8% at age 45-64, 14% at 65-74 and 75-84, and 6% at 85 and over. Poland is the only country with an increasing prostate cancer trend (+18%). Mortality rates for other cancers are predicted to decline further. Over 1989-2020, we estimated over 5 million avoided total cancer deaths and over 400 000 for prostate cancer.
CONCLUSION: Cancer mortality predictions for 2020 in the EU are favourable with a greater decline in men. The number of deaths continue to rise due to population ageing. Due to the persistent amount of predicted lung (and other tobacco-related) cancer deaths, tobacco control remains a public health priority, especially for women. Favourable trends for prostate cancer are largely attributable to continuing therapeutic improvements along with early diagnosis.","2020",,"Ann Oncol",,"other","Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, Europe, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, European Union, FALSE, Forecasting, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, Neoplasms, TRUE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prostatic Neoplasms, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: The genotyping of the rs712 polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 437 BC patients and 414 healthy women.
RESULTS: The observed frequencies of the rs712 polymorphism indicated an associated protective factor for BC in the dominant GT+TT model [odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.97, p=0.040).

There is an absence of evidence concerning the potential impact of HWLs placed on alcohol products on selection of those products. This study aimed to obtain a preliminary assessment of the possible impact of (i) image-and-text, (ii) text-only, and (iii) image-only HWLs on selection of alcoholic versus non-alcoholic drinks.
DESIGN: A between-subjects randomised experiment with a 2 (image: present versus absent) × 2 (text: present versus absent) factorial design.
SETTING: The study was conducted on the online survey platform Qualtrics.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 6024) were adults over the age of 18 who consumed beer or wine regularly (i.e. at least once a week), recruited through a market research agency.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to one of four groups varying in the HWL displayed on the packaging of alcoholic drinks: (i) image-and-text HWL; (ii) text-only HWL; (iii) image-only HWL; and (iv) no HWL. HWLs depicted bowel cancer, breast cancer and liver cancer, which were each displayed twice across six alcoholic drinks. Each group viewed six alcoholic and six non-alcoholic drinks and selected one drink that they would like to consume.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants selecting an alcoholic versus a non-alcoholic drink.
FINDINGS: Alcoholic drink selection was lower for all HWL types compared with no HWL (image-and-text: 56%; image-only: 49%; text-only: 61%; no HWL: 77%), with selection lowest for HWLs that included an image. Image-and-text HWLs reduced the odds of selecting an alcoholic drink compared with text-only HWLs (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69, 0.92), but increased the odds of selecting an alcoholic drink compared with image-only HWLs (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.16, 1.55).

,"32248830","The effect of smoking on biological change of recurrent breast cancer.","Takada K","BACKGROUND: The selection of treatment for a patient with breast cancer largely relies on the cancer subtype. However, this process is complicated by changes in tumor biology at relapse. Smoking has been identified as a risk factor for breast cancer. The direct effect of a tobacco component delivered via blood circulation on the mammary gland tissue and subsequent DNA damage have been proposed to explain the association between cigarette smoking and breast cancer carcinogenesis. This postulation is supported by both tissue culture and animal studies demonstrating that the associated DNA damage further alters breast cancer cells, as indicated by an increased proliferative capacity and malignant transformation. In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between changes in Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) each receptor at recurrence, and smoking and the prognosis after recurrence.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 989 patients with primary breast cancer who developed relapse after surgery and 50 patients who underwent regenerative biopsy or surgery from December 2007 to March 2018. ER, PgR, and HER2 expression in the primary and recurrent lesions was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and the correlations of these expression patterns with smoking history (pack-years) were examined.
RESULTS: When ER was evaluated in recurrent tumors, negative and positive conversions were recognized in 3 (6.0%) and 1 patient (2.0%), respectively. When PgR was evaluated, negative conversion was recognized in 15 patients (30.0%). When HER2 was evaluated, positive conversion was recognized in 6 patients (12.0%). Consequently, we observed a change in the intrinsic subtype in in 5 patients with recurrent tumors (10.0%). Although most clinical factors were not correlated with smoking, a positive conversion of HER2 in recurrence was significantly more frequent among smokers than among non-smokers (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Biological changes during breast cancer recurrence should be given careful clinical consideration because they affect treatment after recurrence.

DESIGN: This is an observational study using convenience sampling. The participants were screened through opportunistic or population-based screening.
SETTING: The study was conducted at a health promotion clinic (HPC) located in Northern India under the Indian Council of Medical Research. HPC is a screening clinic where screening is done for hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and oral, breast and cervical cancers. The study was conducted between December 2016 and January 2019.
PARTICIPANT: The number of participants screened was 8352 (6712 women and 1640 men). All consenting men and women above 18 years were included. All participants were screened for oral cancer, DM, HT and obesity. All women were also screened for breast and cervical cancers. Cervical screening was done for non-pregnant women 21 years and above with history of sexual activity.
RESULT: Oral potentially malignant disease (OPMD) was the most prevalent, followed by breast cancer, oral cancer, cervical cancer and cervical precancer. High RBS had a strong association with oral cancer (OR=2.29, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.82, p=0.03) and breast cancer (OR=1.95, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.76, p=0.05). High BP had a strong association with breast cancer (OR=2.50, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.35, p<0.0001). An inverse association was noted between oral cancer and overweight/obesity (OR=0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.48, p<0.0001). Current tobacco use was strongly associated with oral cancer (OR=6.51, 95% CI 3.63 to 11.67, p<0.0001) and OPMD (OR=9.82, 95% CI 8.13 to 11.86, p<0.0001). No association was elicited between the metabolic NCD risk factors and cervical cancer/precancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The study reaffirms that NCD metabolic risk factors determine oral and breast cancers. Besides NCD risk factors, current tobacco use was a strong determinant of OPMD and oral cancer.

Since in this study, a part of the population had long-term survival, cure models were used and evaluated using DIC index. The data were analyzed using Openbugs Software.
RESULTS: In this study, of 140 breast cancer patients, 23 (16.4%) cases died of breast cancer.

Indication was determined by the 2016 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality measures.
INTERVENTION: The P4P group was paid $150 and received a bonus of $10 for meeting each of five outcome measures (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pneumococcal, tobacco use and depression screenings) for each of the three cases (max $300). The control group received $200.
SETTING: Learning resource centre.
PARTICIPANTS: 35 advanced practice primary care providers (physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and 105 standardised patient encounters.
MEASUREMENTS: Adherence to incentivised outcome measures, interpersonal communication skills, standards of care, and misuse.

,"31877386","Quinacrine and curcumin synergistically increased the breast cancer stem cells death by inhibiting ABCG2 and modulating DNA damage repair pathway.","Nayak D","Cancer stem cell like cells (CSCs) present a challenge in the management of cancers due to their involvement in the development of resistance against various chemotherapeutic agents. Over expression of ABCG2 transporter gene is one of the factors responsible for drug resistance in CSCs, which causes efflux of therapeutic drugs from these cells. The development of inhibitors against CSCs has not achieved any significant success, till date. In this work, we have evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of curcumin (Cur) and quinacrine (QC) against CSCs using in vitro model system. Cur and QC synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of CSCs enriched side population (SP) cells of cigarette smoke condensate induced breast epithelial transformed (MCF-10A-Tr) generated metastatic cells. Cur + QC combination increased the DNA damage and inhibited the DNA repair pathways in SP cells. Uptake of QC increased in Cur pre-treated SP cells and this combination inhibited the ABCG2 activity by the reduction of ATP hydrolysis in cells. In vitro DNA binding reconstitution system suggests that QC specifically binds to DNA and caused DNA damage inside the cell. Decreased level of ABCG2, representative cell survival and DNA repair proteins were noted after Cur + QC treatment in SP cells. The molecular docking studies were performed to examine the binding behaviour of these drugs with ABCG2, which showed that QC (-53.99 kcal/mol) and Cur (-45.90 kcal/mol) occupy a highly overlapping interaction domain. This suggested that in Cur pre-treated cells, the Cur occupied the ligand-binding site in ABCG2, thus making the ligand binding site unavailable for the QC. This causes an increase in the intracellular concentration of QC. The results indicate that Cur + QC combination causes CSCs death by increasing the concentration of QC in the cells and thus causing the DNA damage and inhibiting the DNA repair pathways through modulating the ABCG2 activity.","2020",,"Int J Biochem Cell Biol",,"other","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Apoptosis, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Curcumin, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, DNA Damage, TRUE, DNA Repair, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, DNA, Neoplasm, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Drug Synergism, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasm Proteins, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Neoplastic Stem Cells, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Quinacrine, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: The study population comprised 185,518 cases of cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2009 recorded in the French registries. Survival was known for each patient (endpoint: 30/06/2013). Deprivation was assessed using the European Deprivation Index. We studied the influence of deprivation on mortality, incidence and lethality rates and quantified the respective proportions of incidence and lethality in social inequalities in mortality by calculating attributable deaths.
RESULTS: For cancers with social inequalities both in incidence and lethality, excess mortality in deprived was mainly caused by social inequalities in incidence (e.g. men lung cancer: 87% of excess deaths in the deprived caused by inequalities in incidence). Proportions were more balanced for some cancer sites (e.g. cervical cancer: 56% incidence, 44% lethality). For cancer sites with a higher incidence in the least deprived (e.g. breast cancer), the excess-lethality in deprived leads entirely the higher mortality among the deprived.

METHOD: Questionnaires from 19,898 women in The Danish Nurse Cohort in 1993 were linked to registries on hospitalizations, death causes and migration until Dec 2016. Cancer risk by tobacco and alcohol was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: 16,106 nurses, aged >44 years (mean = 56), were eligible for analysis. Throughout 23 years (mean follow-up = 18.8 years) overall cancers counted 4,968. Of these, 1,897, 2,231, 1,407 and 579 events were smoking-related, alcohol-related, breast cancers and gynecological cancers. Increased risks of overall, smoking-related, and breast cancer were observed for current smoking and excess alcohol intake (>14 units/week), separately, compared to never smoking and light drinking (1-7 units/week) respectively. Moderate drinking (8-14 units/week) increased the risk of alcohol-related and breast cancer.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a sample of women who participated in a population-based breast cancer screening program in 2016 in Hospitalet de Llobregat (n=1,601).

Endogenous estrogen exposure is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women. The most important step in the understanding of the pathogenesis of breast cancer was the development of the theory of the switching of estrogen's effect from hormonal to genotoxic, in which the main culprits of carcinogenesis are not chemical metabolites of estrogens, but their derivatives, corresponding to chemical procarcinogens according to their damaging characteristics. The origin of these substances and the formation of estrogen genotoxicity lies in the disruption of the inactivation process of catechol estrogens in methylation reactions. The main epigenetic modification of the human genome is the methylation of cell DNA molecules. DNA methylation does not alter the primary sequence of nucleotides, but is necessary for the functional suppression of certain genes. The phenomenon of hypomethylation-hypermethylation underlies the long-term silencing of various genes, including tumor suppressor genes. Nutrition and a lifestyle associated with smoking and the consumption of excessive quantities of alcohol determine estrogen metabolism and the availability of methyl groups in the body, as well as epigenetic changes in the DNA of the genome. The assessment of individual risk of breast cancer on the basis of an assay for the expression and methylation of the COMT gene responsible for estrogen metabolism seems relevant.","2019",,"Probl Endokrinol (Mosk)",,"other","Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Catechol O-Methyltransferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA Methylation, TRUE, Estrogens, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogens, Catechol, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We examined the individual and synergistic effects of these modifiable lifestyle factors on overall and site-specific cancer risk.
METHODS: Baseline participant data were acquired from Alberta's Tomorrow Project (ATP). Adults 35-69 years old who consented to data linkage and completed relevant questionnaires were included (n = 26,607). Incident cases of cancer up to December 2017 were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. Associations between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and cancer risk were examined using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. Non-linear effects were estimated using restricted cubic splines. Interactions between alcohol and tobacco were examined through stratified analyses and inclusion of interaction terms in relevant models.
RESULTS: A total of 2,370 participants developed cancer during the study follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard models found no statistically significant associations between alcohol consumption and incidence of all cancers among males (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.40) and females ([HR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-1.10), though a modest and positive association was observed in both males and the entire cohort using cubic splines. Smokers were at an increased risk of developing all cancers (female current smokers: [HR] 1.72, 95% [CI] 1.49-1.99, male current smokers: [HR] 1.24, 95% [CI] 1.03-1.49) with the strongest association observed between current smokers and lung cancer (males: [HR] 11.33, 95% [CI] 4.70-27.30, females: [HR] 23.51, 95% [CI] 12.70-43.60).

PVs with low minor allele frequencies (MAFs) (< 25-35%) are highlighted on germline genetic test reports. In this review, we focus on the challenges of interpreting PVs with low MAF in breast cancer patients undergoing germline testing and the implications for management.The clinical implications of a germline PV are substantial. For PV carriers in high-penetrance genes like BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53, prophylactic mastectomy is often recommended and radiation therapy avoided when possible for those with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). For germline PV carriers in more moderate-risk genes such as PALB2, ATM, and CHEK2, annual breast MRI is recommended and prophylactic mastectomies considered for those with significant family histories. Detection of PVs in cancer susceptibility genes can also lead to recommendations for other prophylactic surgeries (e.g., salpingo-oophorectomy) and increased surveillance for other cancers. Therefore, recognizing when a PV is somatic rather than germline and distinguishing somatic mosaicism from clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is essential. Mutational events that occur at a post-zygotic stage are somatic and will only be present in tissues derived from the mutated cell, characterizing classic mosaicism. Clonal hematopoiesis is a form of mosaicism restricted to the hematopoietic compartment.Among the genes in multi-gene panels used for germline testing of breast cancer patients, the detection of a PV with low MAF occurs most often in TP53, though has been reported in other breast cancer susceptibility genes. Distinguishing a germline TP53 PV (LFS) from a somatic PV (TP53 mosaicism or CH) has enormous implications for breast cancer patients and their relatives.We review how to evaluate a PV with low MAF. The identification of the PV in another tissue confirms mosaicism. Older age, exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and tobacco are known risk factors for CH, as is the absence of a LFS-related cancer in the setting of a TP53 PV with low MAF. The ability to recognize and understand the implications of somatic PVs, including somatic mosaicism and CH, enables optimal personalized care of breast cancer patients.","2019",,"Breast Cancer Res",," review","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Diagnosis, Differential, FALSE, Gene Frequency, FALSE, Genes, p53, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Genetic Testing, FALSE, Hematopoiesis, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Mosaicism, FALSE, Mutation, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

A literature review of studies on the burden of disease from SHS exposure, available in PubMed and SCOPUS, published 2007-2018 in English language, was carried out following the PRISMA recommendations. Overall, 588 studies were first identified, and 94 were eligible. Seventy-two studies were included in the systematic review. Most of them were based on the comparative risk assessment approach, assessing SHS exposure using mainly surveys on exposure at home/workplaces. Diseases more frequently studied were: lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and breast cancer in adults; lower respiratory tract infection, otitis media, asthma, sudden infant death syndrome and low birth weight in children. The SHS exposure assessment and the reported population attributable fractions (PAF) were largely heterogeneous. As an example, the PAF from lung cancer varied between 0.6% and 20.5%.

Combination of electrosurgical units and mass spectrometry (MS) to perform accurate molecular visualization of biological tissues has been pursued by many research groups. Determination of molecular tissue composition at a particular location by surgical smoke analysis is now of increasing interest for clinical use. However, molecular analysis of surgical smoke is commonly lacking molecular specificity and is associated with significant carbonization and chemical contamination, which are mainly related to the high temperature of smoke at which many molecules become unstable. Unlike traditional electrosurgical tools, low-temperature electrosurgical units allow tissue dissection without substantial heating. Here, we show that low-temperature electrosurgical units can be used for desorption of molecules from biological tissues without thermal degradation. The use of extractive electrospray ionization technique for the ionization of desorbed molecules allowed us to obtain mass spectra of healthy and pathological tissues with high degree of differentiation.

We aimed to evaluate time-trends in cancer mortality for adults aged 65 and over for 17 major cancer types and all cancers combined in 11 countries worldwide over the period 1970-2015.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained cancer death certification and population figures from the WHO and PAHO databases. We computed age-standardised (world standard population) rates for individuals aged 65 and over, and applied joinpoint regression models.
RESULTS: Age-standardised mortality rates for all cancers combined showed a heterogeneous, but widespread decline. Lung cancer mortality rates have been decreasing among men, and increasing among women. Pancreatic cancer had unfavourable trends in all countries for both sexes. Despite variability across countries, other tobacco-related cancers (except kidney) showed overall favourable trends, except in Poland and Russia. Age-standardised mortality rates from stomach cancer have been declining in all countries for both sexes. Colorectal mortality has been declining, except in Poland and Russia. Liver cancer mortality increased in all countries, except in Japan, France and Italy, which had the highest rates in the past. Breast cancer mortality decreased for most countries, except for Japan, Poland and Russia. Trends for age-standardised uterine cancer rates in the USA, Canada and the UK were increasing over the last decade. Ovarian cancer rates showed declines in most countries. With the exception of Russia, prostate cancer rates showed overall declines. Lymphoid neoplasms rates have been declining in both sexes, except in Poland and Russia.
CONCLUSION: Over the last decades, age-standardised cancer mortality in the elderly has been decreasing in major countries worldwide and for major cancer sites, with the major exception of lung and uterine cancer in women and liver, pancreatic and kidney cancers in both sexes.

The purpose of our study was to estimate the proportion of women eligible for LCS and tobacco cessation counseling among women reporting mammography screening within the previous 2 years using nationally representative cross-sectional survey data.
METHODS: Women between the ages of 55 and 74 years in the 2015 National Health Interview Survey without history of lung or breast cancer who reported mammography use in the previous 2 years were included. The primary outcome was the weighted proportion of women eligible for LCS. Secondary outcomes included self-reported receipt of LCS and current smoking.

Therefore, it is essential for orthopaedic surgeons to understand the differences in care required by this growing subpopulation. Although the current research suggests that good outcomes can be predicted when appropriately optimized patients with cancer undergo lower extremity total joint arthroplasty, similar studies for TSA are lacking. The primary study question was to examine whether a history of cancer was associated with an increased rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after TSA. Secondarily, we sought to examine any association between a history of prostate and breast cancer and surgical or medical complications after TSA.
METHODS: Using a national insurance database, male patients with a history of prostate cancer and female patients with a history of breast cancer undergoing anatomic TSA for primary osteoarthritis were identified and compared with control subjects matched 3:1 based on age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use. Patients with a history of VTE and patients who underwent reverse TSA or hemiarthroplasty were excluded.
RESULTS: Female patients with a history of breast cancer and male patients with a history of prostate cancer undergoing TSA had significantly higher incidences of acute VTE (including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) compared with matched control subjects (female patients: odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.81; P = 0.024 and male patients: odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.79; P = 0.023). No significant differences were noted in the incidences of any other complications assessed.
CONCLUSION: Although a personal history of these malignancies does represent a statistically significant risk factor for acute VTE after anatomic TSA, the overall VTE rate remains modest and acceptable. The rates of other surgical and medical complications are not significantly increased in patients with a history of these cancers after TSA compared with control subjects.","2020",,"J Am Acad Orthop Surg"," Secondarily , we sought to examine any association between a history of prostate and breast cancer and surgical or medical complications after TSA ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Breast Neoplasms, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Postoperative Complications, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Prostatic Neoplasms, TRUE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Venous Thromboembolism, FALSE, etiology, Q000209",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Despite hormonal agents and chemotherapy, which have beneficial effects on lowering breast cancer death rate, the reaction of different people to these treatments is still a challenging point.

However, the alterations in protein O-GlcNAcylation in Nic-mediated tumorigenesis and malignization mechanisms are less well studied. Herein, we found that cellular O-GlcNAcylation dramatically increased in human breast cancer cells with EMT activation induced by Nic. Elevated O-GlcNAcylation subsequently promoted Nic-induced EMT activation and increased cell migratory abbility. In addition, we demonstrated that a differentiation factor for the mammary epithelium, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein B (CEBPB), was involved in Nic-induced hyper-O-GlcNAcylation via transcriptional regulation of the expression of the key enzyme glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) and thus increased the flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Finally, elevated O-GlcNAcylation of the transcriptional repressor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) suppressed its heterodimerization with CEBPB and facilitated the DNA-binding activity of CEBPB, further generating positive feedback that enhanced EMT upon Nic stimulation.

Previous studies demonstrated that most plastic surgeons do not require preoperative mammography prior to reduction mammaplasty. The incidental discovery of malignant or high-risk lesions in breast reduction specimens may preclude the possibility of breast-conserving surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the factors associated with discussion of preoperative mammography with reduction mammaplasty patients.
METHODS: About 638 consecutive patients were identified between January 2000 and December 2010 who underwent reduction mammaplasty. Clinicopathologic and treatment information was collected. Factors associated with discussion of preoperative mammography prior to surgery were compared.
RESULTS: Of 638 patients, the median age was 36 (range 18-77) with 44% ≥40. Approximately half (56.0%) were White and 37.5% were African-American. The use of mammography was discussed in 43.3% of patients and completed in 41.5%. On final pathology, eight patients (1.3%) had high-risk lesions and two (0.3%) demonstrated malignancy (1 DCIS, 1 invasive).

,"30917803","A comparison of gender-linked population cancer risks between alcohol and tobacco: how many cigarettes are there in a bottle of wine?","Hydes TJ","BACKGROUND: In contrast to our knowledge about the number of cancers attributed to smoking, the number of cancers attributed to alcohol is poorly understood by the public. We estimate the increase in absolute risk of cancer (number of cases per 1000) attributed to moderate levels of alcohol, and compare these to the absolute risk of cancer attributed to low levels of smoking, creating a 'cigarette-equivalent of population cancer harm'.
METHODS: Alcohol and tobacco attributable fractions were subtracted from lifetime general population risks of developing alcohol- and smoking-related cancers, to estimate the lifetime cancer risk in alcohol-abstaining non-smokers. This was multiplied by the relative risk of drinking ten units of alcohol or smoking ten cigarettes per week, and increasing levels of consumption.
RESULTS: One bottle of wine per week is associated with an increased absolute lifetime cancer risk for non-smokers of 1.0% (men) and 1.4% (women). The overall absolute increase in cancer risk for one bottle of wine per week equals that of five (men) or ten cigarettes per week (women). Gender differences result from levels of moderate drinking leading to a 0.8% absolute risk of breast cancer in female non-smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: One bottle of wine per week is associated with an increased absolute lifetime risk of alcohol-related cancers in women, driven by breast cancer, equivalent to the increased absolute cancer risk associated with ten cigarettes per week. These findings can help communicate that moderate levels of drinking are an important public health risk for women.

To prove the hypothesis, we here performed a case-control study to explore the association between rs3787016 and cervical cancer risk, and to confirm the association between rs3787016 and breast cancer in a central Chinese population, which was followed by a meta-analysis to precisely estimate the association between rs3787016 and risk of female breast and cervical cancer. The genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by sequencing. Our results indicated that rs3787016 was associated with the risk of both breast cancer and cervical cancer, and stratified analysis indicated that the association remained particularly for ≤60 years old females who smoke and drink. Moreover, after grouping breast cancer and cervical cancer together, our meta-analysis demonstrated that rs3787016 was associated with overall cancer risk and breast cancer risk.

METHODS: We conducted a case-only analysis using breast tumor tissue from 493 postmenopausal and 225 premenopausal cases in the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) study. Methylation of nine genes (SFN, SCGB3A1, RARB, GSTP1, CDKN2A, CCND2, BRCA1, FHIT, and SYK) was measured with pyrosequencing. Participants reported their secondhand smoke (SHS) and active smoking exposure for seven time periods. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) of having methylation higher than the median.
RESULTS: SHS exposure was associated with tumor DNA methylation among postmenopausal but not premenopausal women. Active smoking at certain ages was associated with increased methylation of GSTP1, FHIT, and CDKN2A and decreased methylation of SCGB3A1 and BRCA1 among both pre- and postmenopausal women.

This retrospective review assesses the concordance of care provided to adult-onset cancer survivors by advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) with Institute of Medicine guidelines for survivorship care.
METHODS: Records from three survivorship clinics at a single institution were reviewed for frequency of recurrence surveillance, screening for second cancers, symptom management (physical, psychological), health promotion education (alcohol, tobacco, cholesterol, and bone density screenings; diet/exercise discussion), care coordination, and provision of care plan. Data were characterized using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Over 2 years, 9,052 unique survivorship visits occurred; 210 breast, 208 prostate, and 204 colorectal visits were randomly selected for review. All patients with breast cancer underwent surveillance for recurrence; 99% were screened for new cancers. Discussion of health promotion activities ranged from 83% to 100%; 91% of patients were reviewed for physical symptoms, and 93% were reviewed for psychological symptoms. All patients with prostate cancer underwent recurrence surveillance; 97% were screened for new primaries. Health promotion activities ranged from 70% to 97%, and symptoms were discussed in 89% of visits. All patients with colorectal cancer underwent a surveillance colonoscopy for recurrence; 97% had a carcinoembryonic antigen test. Among women, 97% had mammograms, and 96% had a Papanicolaou test; 83% of men had a prostate-specific antigen test.

The objective of our pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and the efficacy of delivering NCD screening services at home by trained community health workers (CHWs). Men and women aged 30-60 years residing in rural areas of India were targeted for screening.
METHODS: The CHWs made home visits to educate the participants about healthy lifestyles and symptoms of common cancers and counsel the tobacco/alcohol users to quit. They measured height, weight, blood pressure (BP) and random blood sugar for all and performed oral visual examination (OVE) to screen the tobacco/alcohol users for oral cancer. For cervical cancer screening, the women themselves provided self-collected vaginal samples that the CHWs delivered to the laboratory for high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) detection. The women were not screened for breast cancer but were made aware of the common symptoms and the importance of early diagnosis. Further assessment of the screen-positive individuals and the women with breast symptoms was arranged at the nearest primary health center (PHC).
RESULTS: The CHWs screened 1998 men and 4997 women from 20 villages within 6 months; the refusal rate was less than 10%. High BP and sugar were detected in 32.6% and 7.5% participants respectively; hypertension and diabetes were confirmed in 42.3% and 35% respectively among those undergoing follow-up. Obesity prevalence was only 2.4%. More than 50% men were tobacco chewers. Of the total participants, 2.6% were positive on OVE, though no oral cancer was detected among them. HPV test was positive in 8.6% women and they were triaged with visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA) test for treatment either by thermal ablation (same visit) or by loop excision. VIA was positive in 14% of the HPV-positive women and 56.5% of them received same day ablative treatment. The VIA-negative women were advised follow up after 1 year.

Globally, research has shown that modifying four commonly shared risky behaviours, including poor nutrition, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, and physical inactivity, can reduce occurrence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Risk factor surveillance through population-based periodic surveys, has been identified as an effective strategy to inform public health interventions in NCD control. The stepwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) survey is one such initiative, and Kenya carried out its first survey in 2015. This study sought to describe the physical inactivity risk factors from the findings of the Kenya STEPS survey.
METHODS: This study employed countrywide representative survey administered between April and June 2015. A three stage cluster sampling design was used to select clusters, households and eligible individuals. All adults between 18 and 69 years in selected households were eligible. Data on demographic, behavioural, and biochemical characteristics were collected. Prevalence of physical inactivity was computed. Logistic regression used to explore factors associated with physical inactivity.
RESULTS: A total of 4500 individuals consented to participate from eligible 6000 households. The mean age was 40.5 (39.9-41.1) years, with 51.3% of the respondents being female. Overall 346 (7.7%) of respondents were classified as physically inactive. Physical inactivity was associated with female gender, middle age (30-49 years), and increasing level of education, increasing wealth index and low levels of High Density Lipoproteins (HDL).
CONCLUSION: A modest prevalence of physical inactivity slightly higher than in neighbouring countries was found in this study.

We also recruited family physicians with a leadership role in cancer screening. We used focus groups and a nominal group process to identify informational priorities. Two analysts systematically applied a coding scheme to interview transcripts.
RESULTS: Four groups were held with 34 providers and administrative staff [28 (82%) female, 21 (62%) physicians, 7 (20%) other health professionals and 6 (18%) administrative staff]. PCPs and staff were generally positive about a potential lung cancer screening program but had variable views on their involvement. Informational needs included evidence of potential benefits and harms of screening.

The primary treatment is breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with an adequate clearance margin. Diathermy blade is used extensively in breast-conserving surgery. Surgical smoke produced as a side product has cancer-specific molecular features. Differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) is a rapid and affordable technology for analysis of complex gas mixtures. In our study we examined surgical smoke from malignant and benign breast tissue created with a diathermy blade using DMS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Punch biopsies of 4 mm diameter from breast cancer surgical specimens were taken during gross dissection of fresh surgical specimen and placed in a well plate. The measurement system is a custom-built device called automatic tissue analysis system (ATAS) based on a DMS sensor. Each specimen was incised with a diathermy blade and the surgical smoke was analyzed.
RESULTS: We examined 106 carcinoma samples from 21 malignant breast tumors. Benign samples (n = 198) included macroscopically normal mammary gland (n = 82), adipose tissue (n = 88) and vascular tissue (n = 28). The classification accuracy when comparing malignant samples to all benign samples was 87%. The sensitivity was 80% and the specificity was 90%.

Breast cancer is the number one cancer with a rising trend in the majority of LMICs. Implementation of mass-scale mammography-based screening is not feasible and sustainable in most of them. While some LMICs have introduced breast cancer screening based on clinical breast examination (CBE), the programs need to be of appropriate quality. All LMICs should improve the capacity for early diagnosis of breast cancer along with other common cancers through community education, training of frontline health workers, facilitating prompt referrals and improving the infrastructure for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Resources permitting, the LMICs with high burden of cervical cancer may consider human papillomavirus (HPV) detection-based screening; a simple low-cost alternative is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Regardless of the choice, a strong linkage should be established between screening and treatment with implementation of robust quality assurance.

In the CG, the whole breast received 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions (fx) using 3D-radiotherapy, plus a sequential electron boost (10 Gy in 4 fx) to tumor bed. In MARA-1 group, a forward-planned intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique with 40 Gy in 16 fx with a concomitant boost of 4 Gy to breast was used. The primary endpoint was to evaluate late toxicity, and secondary endpoints were acute toxicity, local control, and survival. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03461224.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 52 months (range: 3-115 months). Late skin and subcutaneous toxicity were acceptable: 5-year actuarial cumulative incidence of Grade (G) 3 late skin toxicity was 1.5% in CG and 0.0% in MARA-1. Five-year actuarial cumulative incidence of G3 late subcutaneous toxicity was 0.8% in CG and 0.3% in MARA-1. On multivariate analysis, tobacco smoking and planning target volume were associated with an increased risk of late G1 skin toxicity (HR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.38-3.34 and HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.18, respectively), whereas patients with a larger planning target volume also showed an increased risk of G1 and G2 late subcutaneous toxicity (HR: 1.14, CI 95%: 1.08-1.20 and HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.28, respectively).

The present study evaluates the association between relative caloric intake and MD in Spanish women.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 3517 women were recruited from seven breast cancer screening centers. MD was measured by an experienced radiologist using craniocaudal mammography and Boyd's semi-quantitative scale. Information was collected through an epidemiological survey. Predicted calories were calculated using linear regression models, including the basal metabolic rate and physical activity as explanatory variables. Overeating and caloric restriction were defined taking into account the 99% confidence interval of the predicted value. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using center-specific mixed ordinal logistic regression models, adjusted for age, menopausal status, body mass index, parity, tobacco use, family history of breast cancer, previous biopsies, age at menarche and adherence to a Western diet.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mammographic density.
RESULTS: Those women with an excessive caloric intake (>40% above predicted) presented higher MD (OR = 1.41, 95%CI = 0.97-2.03; p = 0.070). For every 20% increase in relative caloric consumption the probability of having higher MD increased by 5% (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.98-1.14; p = 0.178), not observing differences between the categories of explanatory variables. Caloric restriction was not associated with MD in our study.

Compared with the lowest quintile of lifestyle index score (meeting fewest guidelines), women in the highest quintile had a 24% lower risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.82) and 37% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.76), while the association with breast cancer-specific mortality was nonsignificant.

However, previous findings based on a SNP by SNP approach need to be replicated taking into account the combined effects of multiple SNPs. We used a gene-set analysis method to study the association between breast cancer risk and genetic variation in XM genes (seen as a set of SNPs) and in the XM pathway (seen as a set of genes). We also studied the interaction between variants in XM genes and tobacco smoking. The analysis was conducted in a case-control study of 1,125 cases and 1,172 controls. Using a dedicated chip, genotyping data of 585 SNPs in 68 XM genes were available. Genetic variation in the whole XM pathway was significantly associated with premenopausal breast cancer risk (p = 0.008). This association was mainly driven by genetic variation in NAT2, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, AKR1C2 and ALDH1A3. The association between the XM gene pathway and breast cancer was observed among current and previous smokers, but not among never smokers (p = 0.013 for interaction between XM genes and tobacco smoking status). The association with breast cancer risk indicates that XM genes variants may play a role in breast carcinogenesis through their detoxification function of environmental pollutants, such as those contained in tobacco smoke.","2019",,"Int J Cancer",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Carcinogenesis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, TRUE, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Middle Aged, FALSE, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoke, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Nicotiana, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Xenobiotics, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"30284040","Design, implementation, and evaluation of an intervention to improve referral to smoking cessation services in breast cancer patients.","Nolan M","PURPOSE: Smoking is a risk factor for poor outcomes following breast reconstructive surgery. This project aimed to design and implement an intervention to consistently refer all breast cancer patients to tobacco treatment services.
METHODS: In formative work, a set of processes for providers to consistently refer patients to a tobacco treatment specialist at the Nicotine Dependence Center (NDC) was designed. Elements included consistent documentation of smoking status, provider advice specific to the benefits of quitting to cancer care, referral to NDC using an ""opt-out"" strategy that emphasized smoking cessation as a standard part of breast cancer treatment, and reinforcement of the importance of the referral by multiple personnel. The number of referrals to the NDC and number of patients who attended their scheduled NDC appointment were measured before and 1 year after implementation. Qualitative evaluation was performed using semi-structured interviews with participating providers and patients regarding acceptability.
RESULTS: The proportion of smoking patients referred to the NDC increased from 29% (22/75) before the intervention to 74% (20/27) afterward. Among those referred, attendance at the consultation increased from 41% (9/22) to 75% (15/20). This occurred despite provider interviews revealing knowledge gaps about the referral process and evidence of provider adaptation to accommodate personal practice. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were high.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that similar referral interventions for all cancer patients should be pursued with the aim of embedding tobacco dependence treatment seamlessly and consistently into the cancer treatment plan of every patient who smokes cigarettes.","2019",,"Support Care Cancer"," PURPOSE : Smoking is a risk factor for poor outcomes following breast reconstructive surgery ","other","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Female, FALSE, Health Services, FALSE, standards, Q000592, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Quality Improvement, FALSE, standards, Q000592, Referral and Consultation, FALSE, Smoking Cessation, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Standard of Care, FALSE, standards, Q000592",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

However, the correlation between SHS and BC risk remains controversial. In this study, we investigated whether the physiological SHS achievable dose of Nic and tobacco specific nitrosamine, NNK act together to induce breast carcinogenesis using an in vitro breast cell carcinogenesis model. Immortalized non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, HBL-100 used for a time-course assay, was exposed to very low levels of either Nic or NNK, or both. The time-course assay consisted of 23 cycles of nitrosamines treatment. In each cycle, HBL-100 cells were exposed to 1pM of Nic and/or 100 femtM of NNK for 48 hours. Cells were passaged every 3 days and harvested after 10, 15, and 23 cycles. Our results demonstrated that the tumorigenicity of HBL-100, defined by soft agar colony forming, proliferation, migration and invasion abilities, was enhanced by co-exposure to physiologically SHS achievable doses of Nic and NNK. In addition, α9-nAChR signaling activation, which plays an important role in cellular proliferation and cell survival, was also observed. Importantly, an increase in stemness properties including the prevalence of CD44+/CD24- cells, increase Nanog expression and mammosphere-forming ability were also observed.

We analyzed detailed prospectively collected clinical and epidemiological data from the IBC Registry at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
METHODS: Patients with IBC (n = 248) were consecutively diagnosed and prospectively enrolled between November 2006 and April 2013. All patients were newly diagnosed and at least 18 years old. Secondary IBC was excluded. Overall 160 variables were collected and evaluated including sociodemographics, anthropometrics, tobacco and alcohol consumption, reproductive variables, and family history data.
RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 51.6 (±11.5 SD) years, and the majority of patients were White (77.8%). A mean BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, irrespective of menopausal status, was observed in 80.2% of all patients, with 82.6% of African Americans being obese. Approximately 42.2% of patients were ever smokers, and 91% reported ever being pregnant. A history of breastfeeding was reported in 54% of patients, with significant differences between ethnic groups in favor of White women (P<0.0001). Other reproductive factors such as use of birth control pills & hormone replacement therapy were also more frequently associated with White women compare to other ethnic groups (P < 0.05). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, African American or Hispanic ethnicity, not having breastfed, higher clinical stage, and TNBC subtype were associated with shorter survival.

We present a comprehensive picture of the patterns and time trends of the burden of total cancer and specific cancer types in each state of India estimated as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 because such a systematic compilation is not readily available.
METHODS: We used all accessible data from multiple sources, including 42 population-based cancer registries and the nationwide Sample Registration System of India, to estimate the incidence of 28 types of cancer in every state of India from 1990 to 2016 and the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by them, as part of GBD 2016. We present incidence, DALYs, and death rates for all cancers together, and the trends of all types of cancers, highlighting the heterogeneity in the burden of specific types of cancers across the states of India. We also present the contribution of major risk factors to cancer DALYs in India.
FINDINGS: 8·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 7·9-8·6) of the total deaths and 5·0% (4·6-5·5) of the total DALYs in India in 2016 were due to cancer, which was double the contribution of cancer in 1990. However, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer did not change substantially during this period. The age-standardised cancer DALY rate had a 2·6 times variation across the states of India in 2016. The ten cancers responsible for the highest proportion of cancer DALYs in India in 2016 were stomach (9·0% of the total cancer DALYs), breast (8·2%), lung (7·5%), lip and oral cavity (7·2%), pharynx other than nasopharynx (6·8%), colon and rectum (5·8%), leukaemia (5·2%), cervical (5·2%), oesophageal (4·3%), and brain and nervous system (3·5%) cancer. Among these cancers, the age-standardised incidence rate of breast cancer increased significantly by 40·7% (95% UI 7·0-85·6) from 1990 to 2016, whereas it decreased for stomach (39·7%; 34·3-44·0), lip and oral cavity (6·4%; 0·4-18·6), cervical (39·7%; 26·5-57·3), and oesophageal cancer (31·2%; 27·9-34·9), and leukaemia (16·1%; 4·3-24·2). We found substantial inter-state heterogeneity in the age-standardised incidence rate of the different types of cancers in 2016, with a 3·3 times to 11·6 times variation for the four most frequent cancers (lip and oral, breast, lung, and stomach). Tobacco use was the leading risk factor for cancers in India to which the highest proportion (10·9%) of cancer DALYs could be attributed in 2016.
INTERPRETATION: The substantial heterogeneity in the state-level incidence rate and health loss trends of the different types of cancer in India over this 26-year period should be taken into account to strengthen infrastructure and human resources for cancer prevention and control at both the national and state levels. These efforts should focus on the ten cancers contributing the highest DALYs in India, including cancers of the stomach, lung, pharynx other than nasopharynx, colon and rectum, leukaemia, oesophageal, and brain and nervous system, in addition to breast, lip and oral cavity, and cervical cancer, which are currently the focus of screening and early detection programmes.

METHODS: The study included long-term follow-up data from almost 7.5 million Nordic women. Participants were assigned to one of the 54 occupational categories based on census records at the ages of 30-64 years. Sixty-two thousand cases of breast cancer were identified through record linkages between nationwide cancer registries in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, followed up between 1961 and 2005. Country-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated.
RESULTS: Overall, the highest risk elevations were seen among military personnel (SIR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03-2.32), dentists (SIR 1.43, 95% CI 1.31-1.56), and physicians (SIR 1.35, 95% CI 1.26-1.46).

Welders, tobacco workers, and painters had higher SIRs for breast cancer diagnosed at age < 50. A reduced risk was observed among forestry workers, welders, and fishery workers for breast cancers diagnosed both before and after age 50. The SIRs for breast cancer did not vary substantially by histology. A significantly increased risk of breast cancer was observed among laboratory workers in the latest calendar period (1991-2005) compared with earlier periods (1976-1990 and 1961-1975).

However, early or late complications related to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy remain at a high rate and greatly increase the risk of late mortality. The objective of this study is to assess the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, measured through heart rate variability indices in childhood cancer survivors compared with healthy controls.
METHODS: This prospective study included 51 long-term childhood cancer survivors diagnosed before 15 years of age between 1987 and 1992 and controlled for age and sex with healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in spontaneous heart rate (beats per minute) (67 ± 10 vs. 60 ± 10, p = 0.001), and all the studied parameters showed a significantly altered ANS activity in cases compared with healthy controls. In both groups, the main cofactors of dysautonomia (tobacco, drugs, cannabis, estro-progestative pills, alcohol, limited physical activity) were analyzed without any significant difference. The effect of cancer treatments received was not analyzed due to the small number of participants.
CONCLUSION: The results showed a significant ANS dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors compared with healthy controls and suggested the value of autonomic screening to underscore and possibly quantify the effect of the cancer treatments in a larger cohort.

This reflects the breast cancer mortality declines due to access to screening and effective treatment alongside the entrance of certain countries in stages of the tobacco epidemic in which smoking becomes more prevalent in women. In this study, we project lung and breast cancer mortality until 2030 in 52 countries. Cancer mortality data were obtained from the WHO Mortality Database. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), per 100,000, were calculated (direct method) for 2008 to 2014 and projected for the years 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030 using a Bayesian log-linear Poisson model. In 52 countries studied around the world, between 2015 and 2030, the median ASMR are projected to increase for lung cancer, from 11.2 to 16.0, whereas declines are expected for breast cancer, from 16.1 to 14.7. In the same period, the ASMR will decrease in 36 countries for breast cancer and in 15 countries for lung cancer. In half of the countries analyzed, and in nearly three quarters of those classified as high-income countries, the ASMR for lung cancer has already surpassed or will surpass the breast cancer ASMR before 2030. The mortality for lung and breast cancer is higher in high-income countries than in middle-income countries; lung cancer mortality is lower in the latter because the tobacco epidemic is not yet widespread.

METHODS: During the period 2008-2012, 23,046 new cases were registered and during 2011-2015 there were 12,761 cancer deaths. The trend of the rates was described with the APC average annual change rate and with the Joinpoint analysis. We analyzed the individual data of 38,671 adults (15-99 years) diagnosed with cancer between 1995-2009, and we calculated the standardized net survival by age for the 14 most common cancer body sites, using the Pohar-Perme method.
RESULTS: Prostate and breast cancer were the first cause of cancer morbidity. The incidence rates in these were susceptible to early detection, tumors stabilized after decades of growth, while an increase in the incidence of colon cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma was observed. The incidence rates of cervical and stomach cancer and conditions related to infectious agents decreased, although the number of absolute cases increased, due to the growth and aging of the population. Gastric cancer was responsible for the highest number of cancer related deaths. The types of cancer related to tobacco consumption (lung, oral cavity, esophagus, pancreas, urinary bladder) showed low numbers and a tendency to decrease. During the period 2000-2004, the 5-year net survival improved for cancers of the breast, cervix, prostate, melanoma and thyroid, although in the period 2005-2009 a stagnation was observed. In stomach, liver and lung cancer, the 5-year net survival was less than 15%. The 5-year overall survival in children was 51.0% (95% CI: 47.5, 54.3) and in adolescents 44.6% (95% CI: 36.0, 52.8).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate comorbidity, risk factors for comorbidity, and how comorbidity was associated with symptoms and quality of life in patients being treated for breast cancer.
METHODS: One hundred and one breast cancer chemotherapy outpatients completed this study. Comorbid conditions, weight, height, and smoking status were identified by chart review. Symptoms and quality of life were self-reported using psychometrically sound instruments. Log-linear regression analyses with age as the covariate examined impact of ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking on comorbidities.
RESULTS: Approximately 84% of the participants had 1 or more comorbid conditions. Adjusting for age, number of comorbidities differed by BMI (P = .000); the obese group had significantly more comorbidities than the normal and overweight groups. The interaction between BMI and smoking was significant (P = .047). The obese participants who smoked had significantly more comorbidities compared with those who were obese but did not smoke (P = .001). More comorbid conditions were associated with greater pain (P < .05) and poorer sleep quality (P < .05). Comorbidity significantly correlated with symptoms and functional aspects of quality of life (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). A greater number of comorbidities was associated with lower physical and role functioning and worse fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, and nausea and vomiting (all P < .05).

METHODS: From August to October 2015, a self-administered questionnaire was sent by post to 2 900 women aged 50-65, living in Côte-d'Or, France, and who were up to date with mammogram screening. Polytomic logistic regression was used to identify correlates of participation in both cervical and colorectal cancer screenings. Participation in all 3 screenings was chosen as the reference.
RESULTS: Study participation rate was 66.3% (n = 1856). Besides being compliant with mammogram, respectively 78.3% and 56.6% of respondents were up to date for cervical and colorectal cancer screenings, while 46.2% were compliant with the 3 screenings. Consultation with a gynecologist in the past year was associated with higher chance of undergoing the 3 screenings or female cancer screenings (p<10-4), when consultation with a GP was associated with higher chance of undergoing the 3 screenings or organized cancer screenings (p<0.05). Unemployment, obesity, age>59 and yearly flu vaccine were associated with a lower involvement in cervical cancer screening. Women from high socio-economic classes were more likely to attend only female cancer screenings (p = 0.009). Finally, a low level of physical activity and tobacco use were associated with higher risk of no additional screening participation (p<10-3 and p = 0.027).

,"29807732","[Smoking in France: What is the situation?].","Josseran L","Tobacco consumption in France is still important. Several reasons explain this: a great proximity between the State and the tobacco industry which allows an important lobby up to the highest level of the State, valorization by the elites. Yet things change gradually. The image of tobacco is less positive and the epidemiology of consumption has changed since the early 2000s. While adult consumption remains around 30% of daily smokers, youth consumption is steadily decreasing (41% in 2000 vs. 25% in 2017). Another positive point is the decrease in the number of smokers among general practitioners, 1994: 34% vs. 16% in 2015. These points hide the current reality of smoking in France that kills 73,000 people/year and lung cancer rates that literally explode in women. In 20 years, the incidence of lung cancer in women has increased from 5/10,000 people/year to 12/10,000 people years making lung cancer in women the leading cause of cancer deaths from breast cancer. At the same time, men went from 50/10,000 to 40/10,000. Finally, this health impact is responsible for a major financial impact: the social cost of tobacco in France is estimated at € 120 billion a year.

,"29788174","Aspirin abrogates impairment of mammary gland differentiation induced by early in life second-hand smoke in mice.","Santucci-Pereira J","Epidemiological studies show that there is limited evidence that tobacco smoking causes breast cancer in humans. In rodents, many tobacco smoke chemicals cause mammary gland tumors. This study evaluated the mammary gland differentiation in mice exposed to environmental cigarette smoke (ECS), using 3R4F Kentucky reference cigarettes, starting after birth and continuing daily for 10 weeks (total particulate exposure 95 mg/m3; CO 610 ppm). We also analyzed the effects of oral administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin (1600 mg/kg) or naproxen (320 mg/kg), on mammary gland differentiation, either in unexposed or ECS-exposed mice. The ECS exposure caused delay of mammary glands development. We speculate that this delay may result from aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling activation, which has an antiestrogenic effect and crosstalk to the estrogen metabolism pathway. Similarly, naproxen impaired gland differentiation in unexposed and ECS-exposed mice, while aspirin hindered its development only in unexposed mice. The lack of differentiation induced by the NSAIDs could be explained by their antiestrogenic effect through inhibition of aldo-keto reductases. In ECS-exposed animals, aspirin induced intense lobular formation, which could indicate that aspirin is counteracting the AHR signaling induced by ECS. Based on the differentiation induced by aspirin in ECS-exposed animals, we postulate that these mice would be less susceptible to mammary carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that exposure to smoke at an early age impairs the development of the mammary gland, thus resulting in a longer period of susceptibility and increased risk of breast cancer.

Recent scientific evidence suggested PBL-TL plays a diverse role in different cancers. Inconsistent results were obtained on PBL-TL in relation to breast cancer risk and specifically to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.
METHODS: PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance. A multivariable Generalised Linear Model was fitted to the data with PBL-TL as the dependent variable, case/control status and presence of a BRCA/VUS mutation as factors, and age in 4 strata as a covariate.
RESULTS: Age was significantly associated with decreasing PBL-TL in controls (p = 0.01), but not in BC cases. The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL. A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.

This review does not discuss early detection strategies for breast cancer, including breast cancer screening. The breast is the most common site among women worldwide of noncutaneous cancer. Many clinical and genetic factors have been found to increase a woman's risk of developing the disease. Current strategies to decrease a woman's risk of developing breast cancer include primary prevention, such as avoiding tobacco, exogenous hormone use and excess exposure to ionizing radiation, maintaining a normal weight, exercise, breastfeeding, eating a healthy diet and minimizing alcohol intake. Chemoprevention medications are available for those at high risk, though they are underutilized in eligible women. Mastectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy are reasonable strategies for women who have deleterious mutations in genes that dramatically increase the risk of developing cancer in either breast. There are a variety of strategies in development for the prevention of breast cancer. Personalized approaches to prevent breast cancer that are being developed focus on advances in precision medicine, knowledge of the immune system and the tumor microenvironment and their role in cancer development. Advances in our understanding of how breast cancer develops are allowing investigators to specifically target populations who are most likely to benefit.

METHODS: This study included all individuals with at least one visit to one of 196 general practitioners' offices in the UK between January 1988 and December 2008 (index date). Only individuals with documented smoking status were included. Smokers and non-smokers were matched (1:1) by age, gender, index year, body mass index, and physician. The main outcome of the study was the risk of cancer as a function of smoking status. Data regarding a total of 25 cancers were available for the present analysis. The risk of cancer was analyzed using Cox's regression model.
RESULTS: The present retrospective study included 211,005 smokers and 211,005 non-smokers. The mean age was 36.5 years (SD = 12.5 years) in men and 34.3 years (SD = 13.1 years) in women.

The aims of this study were to: (1) assess how national cancer societies in developed English-speaking countries [i.e. English-speaking countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)] communicate alcohol-related cancer risk to the public and (2) compare whether these organization's advocacy of increased alcohol taxes is in line with their advocacy of tobacco tax increases to reduce cancer risk.
METHODS: We searched the websites of the following national cancer organizations for all statements related to the relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer risk: Cancer Council Australia, Canadian Cancer Society, Irish Cancer Society, Cancer Society New Zealand, Cancer Research UK and the American Cancer Society. A categorical system was developed to code the qualitative data for health statements, alcohol consumption recommendations, and tax policy recommendations. Websites were analyzed in March of 2017.
RESULTS: All organizations, with the exception of the American Cancer Society and Canadian Cancer Society, state that alcohol is a group 1 carcinogen and that even low-level alcohol consumption increases risk for some cancers. Additionally, while the American Cancer Society supports increasing tobacco taxes through its cancer action network, it has not advocated for increased alcohol taxes in relation to support for tobacco tax increases.

Several factors can increase one’s risk of CRC, including a personal or family history of CRC, a diagnosis or family history of a hereditary colon cancer syndrome, or a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this project was to create a colorectal cancer registry (Co-Care) for individuals with a personal or family history of CRC, and those with disorders of the colon or rectum that are associated with an increased risk for developing CRC. METHODS: To be eligible for the registry, patients either had a personal or family history of CRC, a diagnosis or family history of Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, or a diagnosis of Crohn’s colitis or ulcerative colitis with dysplasia. Participants were recruited after seeing their gastroenterologist or genetic counselor, or after undergoing a full or partial colectomy at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Eligible patients who agreed to participate were interviewed by a member of the research staff and asked a wide range of questions pertaining to CRC risk. RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were enrolled in the registry. Participants are mostly white, born in the United States, and married, with a bachelor’s or graduate degree, reporting an annual household income of $100,000 or more. The largest portion have a family history of CRC (27.2%), and almost half of participants are of Jewish descent (46.2%) and have undergone full or partial colectomy (48.2%). More than half of participants have neither received genetic counseling (54.5%) nor undergone genetic testing (59.7%). Only 3.6% report that they currently smoke cigarettes, and 41.1% consume alcohol at least once per week. Lastly, 18.3%, 10.3%, and 27.7% of participants report that they currently take aspirin, folic acid/folate pills or tablets, or calcium pills/tablets, respectively.

METHODS: The EDIFICE 4 nationwide observational survey was conducted by phone interviews of a representative female population (737 laywomen and 105 female physicians) aged 40-75 years, using the quota method. This analysis focuses on spontaneous replies to the question ""In your opinion, what are the five main risk factors that increase the risk of breast cancer?"".
RESULTS: Heredity/Family history of breast cancer was the most widely recognized risk factor in both study populations (98.1% physicians vs. 54.2% laywomen; P ≤ 0.01). Smoking (19.0 and 17.5%) and alcohol consumption (3.8 and 5.5%) were among the lifestyle risk factors that were cited by similar proportions of physicians and laywomen, respectively. Other established risk factors were however very rarely cited by either physicians or laywomen, e.g., Exposure to medical radiation (4.8 vs. 0.4%, respectively; P ≤ 0.05) or not cited at all, i.e., Benign mastopathy and Personal history of breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: This survey highlights a number of misconceptions relating to behavioral risk factors for breast cancer, including the relative impact of alcohol and tobacco consumption and the importance of menopausal status. The limited awareness of the risk related to Exposure to medical radiation, Benign mastopathy, or Personal history raises concern regarding compliance with national screening recommendations.","2018",,"Curr Oncol Rep"," We investigated knowledge of breast cancer risk factors not only among laywomen but also among female physicians ","observational study","Awareness, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mass Screening, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Physicians, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

So far, this has not been studied thoroughly and large studies taking into account diverse potential confounding factors are lacking. IBD per se has not been associated with development of cervical cancer, yet patients with Crohn's disease who smoke, have a younger age at diagnosis or who use(d) thiopurines might be more at risk. Other immunosuppressive medication seems not to increase this risk, however, as evidence at this point is incomplete, physician awareness and prevention by lifestyle counseling, HPV vaccination and (intensified) screening are warranted. The risk for breast, endometrial, ovarian, and vulvovaginal cancer in IBD patients appears to be comparable to the background population, although for breast cancer this may even be decreasedin Crohn's disease specifically. Immunosuppressive medication in general does not seem to alter this risk. Earlier and more frequent screening for breast cancer than currently conducted in general nationwide screening programs is not recommended at this moment. Current literature suggests a much lower overall malignancy recurrence rate in IBD patients than has been observed previously. More importantly, immune suppressive medication does not appear to increase the recurrence risk.

Nicotine, the major constituent in cigarette smoke, has also shown negative effects on stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely demonstrated to migrate into tumors and play key roles in cancer progression. However, the mechanisms by which nicotine impacts MSCs and tumorigenesis of lung cancer are still undetermined. In this study we investigated the effects of nicotine on human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) and the impacts of nicotine-treated hUC-MSCs on tumor formation and progression. We found that nicotine has a toxic effect on hUC-MSCs and changes the morphology, inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of hUC-MSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Nicotine-treated hUC-MSCs produce higher level of IL-6. Moreover, nicotine promotes migration, stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hUC-MSCs by inhibiting E-cadherin expression and upregulating mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin and Vimentin, leading to the induction of stem cell markers Sox2, Nanog, Sall4, Oct4 and CD44. Migration and proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells are promoted after their coculture with nicotine-treated hUC-MSCs in a cell-cell contact-independent manner. Furthermore, nicotine-treated hUC-MSCs promote tumor formation and growth of A549 cells in nude mice. These studies demonstrated that the enhanced stemness and EMT of hUC-MSCs induced by nicotine are critical for the development of tobacco-related cancers.","2018",,"Oncotarget"," In this study we investigated the effects of nicotine on human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( hUC-MSCs ) and the impacts of nicotine-treated hUC-MSCs on tumor formation and progression ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the association between tobacco smoking and cancer incidence in a cohort of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. The study population consisted of unaffected BRCA mutation carriers. Information on lifestyle including smoking histories, reproductive factors, and past medical histories was obtained through questionnaires. Incident cancers were updated biennially via follow-up questionnaires. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using time-dependent Cox regression models. There were 700 incident cancers diagnosed over 26,711 person-years of follow-up. The most frequent cancers seen in BRCA mutation carriers were breast (n = 428; 61%) and ovarian (n = 109; 15%) cancer. Compared to nonsmokers, (ever) smoking was associated with a modest increased risk of all cancers combined (HR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.01-1.37).

,"29319579","How Big is Too Big: Pushing the Obesity Limits in Microsurgical Breast Reconstruction.","Spitz JA","PURPOSE: Obesity is a major public health concern in the United States, affecting nearly 79 million people. There have been promising results performing microvascular breast reconstruction in patients with obesity; however, the definition of obesity is often poorly defined or does not extend above a body mass index (BMI) of 35. Our goal was to examine outcomes of microvascular breast reconstruction in this questionably more risky population.
METHODS: A retrospective review from 2013 to 2016 was performed of 2 surgeons' experience with abdominally based microvascular breast reconstructions. Women were categorized by BMI into the following groups: normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m), overweight (25.1-29.0 kg/m), class I (30.0-34.9 kg/m), class II (35.0-39.9 kg/m), and class III (>40 kg/m). Demographics included history of tobacco use, breast cancer diagnosis, adjuvant care, and comorbidities. Complications evaluated included donor site (delayed wound healing, fat necrosis, dehiscence, infection, abdominal hernia/bulge, and seroma), recipient site (delayed wound healing and fat necrosis), and need for reoperation. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance and χ test.
RESULTS: A total of 90 women (117 breasts) underwent microsurgical breast reconstruction using abdominal tissue. Twenty-seven women (48 breasts) met criteria for class II and class III obesity (BMI 35-53). Mean follow-up was 24 months. No statistically significant difference was found in demographics among all groups. There was a trend toward variability in overall complications across the BMI groups (P = 0.149). Donor site complications had a significant variation across the different BMI groups (P = 0.016). The rate of donor site complications was similar in class II (8/14) and class III (7/13) obese women. Recipient site complications were similar across the BMI groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We found obese women to have a higher rate of abdominal donor site complications; however, this risk seems to level off at class I or II obesity. We have modified our surgical technique of managing the abdominal donor site to optimize our outcomes in the morbidly obese patient population.","2018",,"Ann Plast Surg"," PURPOSE : Obesity is a major public health concern in the United States , affecting nearly 79 million people ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Body Mass Index, TRUE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mammaplasty, TRUE, methods, Q000379, Microsurgery, TRUE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Obesity, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Postoperative Complications, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

According to specific legislations, European specialists could not benefit from the use of human-derived ADMs, even though most evidence in the literature are available for this kind of device, showed optimal outcomes in breast reconstruction. The Skin Bank of the Bufalini Hospital (Cesena, Italy) obtained in 2009 the approval for the production and distribution of a new human cadaver-donor-derived ADM (named with the Italian acronym, MODA, for matrice omologa dermica acellulata) from the Italian National Transplant Center and National Health Institute. We report preliminary results of MODA application in direct-to-implant breast reconstruction following nipple-areola complex (NAC)-sparing mastectomy for breast cancer treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all women undergoing NAC-sparing mastectomy for breast cancer and DTI-BR in our breast surgical unit from June 2015 to January 2017. We enrolled a selected population without previous chest wall irradiation, not being heavy tobacco smokers or diabetic, with a BMI < 30 kg/m
RESULTS: From June 2015 to January 2017, we treated 56 breasts. At a mean follow-up of 14 months, we observed only two minor complications described as limited wound dehiscences, conservatively managed with complete resolution without implant exposure or re-intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results show very good performance of MODA in direct-to-implant breast reconstruction following NAC-sparing mastectomy for breast cancer treatment. This is particularly relevant for the European market, where no other human-derived devices are available for breast reconstruction due to regulatory restrictions.

We retrospectively evaluated the association of HER2 polymorphisms, tobacco use and alcohol consumption with disease-free survival (DFS) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinicopathologic and survival data (median follow-up, 7.4 years) were collected from medical records for 236 nonmetastatic trastuzumab-treated HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Tobacco and alcohol consumption were assessed using validated questionnaires, and HER2 polymorphisms (Ile655Val and Ala1170Pro) were determined by TaqMan assay. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze DFS.
RESULTS: Compared to nonsmokers, patients who smoked before breast cancer diagnosis showed a worse DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.63, P = .001), and this association was stronger among patients who smoked > 20 cigarettes per day or who spent more than 2 decades smoking before their diagnosis (HR, 3.65, P = .01, and HR, 3.19, P = .002, respectively). Smoking during trastuzumab treatment was associated with DFS, but only among patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors (HR, 4.49, P = .02). Compared to nondrinkers, patients who consumed alcohol before breast cancer diagnosis had a significantly better DFS (HR, 0.56, P = .03). No association was observed between alcohol consumption during trastuzumab treatment and DFS. Concerning HER2 polymorphisms, patients with Ile/Val or Val/Val genotype had a significantly worse DFS than those with the Ile/Ile genotype (HR, 4.96, P = .01).
CONCLUSION: Tobacco and alcohol consumption as well as HER2 Ile655Val polymorphism could influence trastuzumab response.

,"29197760","Lifetime exposure to ambient air pollution and methylation of tumor suppressor genes in breast tumors.","Callahan CL","BACKGROUND: We previously reported increased risk of breast cancer associated with early life exposure to two measures of air pollution exposure, total suspended particulates (TSP) and traffic emissions (TE), possible proxies for exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Exposure to PAHs has been shown to be associated with aberrant patterns of DNA methylation in peripheral blood of healthy individuals. Exposure to PAHs and methylation in breast tumor tissue has received little attention. We examined the association of early life exposure to TSP and TE with patterns of DNA methylation in breast tumors.
METHODS: We conducted a study of women enrolled in the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) Study. Methylation of nine genes (SFN, SCGB3A1, RARB, GSTP1, CDKN2A CCND2, BRCA1, FHIT, and SYK) was assessed using bisulfite-based pyrosequencing. TSP exposure at each woman's home address at birth, menarche, and when she had her first child was estimated. TE exposure was modeled for each woman's residence at menarche, her first birth, and twenty and ten years prior to diagnosis. Unconditional logistic regression was employed to estimate odds ratios (OR) of having methylation greater than the median value, adjusting for age, secondhand smoke exposure before age 20, current smoking status, and estrogen receptor status.
RESULTS: Exposure to higher TSP at a woman's first birth was associated with lower methylation of SCGB3A1 (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.23-0.99) and higher methylation of SYK (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.03-3.35). TE at menarche was associated with increased methylation of SYK (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.05-5.33). TE at first birth and ten years prior to diagnosis was associated with decreased methylation of CCND2 (OR ten years prior to diagnosis=0.48, 95% CI: 0.26-0.89). Although these associations were nominally significant, none were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed suggestive evidence that exposure to ambient air pollution throughout life, measured as TSP and TE, may be associated with DNA methylation of some tumor suppressor genes in breast tumor tissue.

DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed as infiltrating ductal carcinoma of left breast with the hepatic and pulmonary metastasis. The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is not involved.
INTERVENTIONS: She received treatment with CAP that was administered orally at a dosage of 1500mg twice daily intermittently (2weeks on/1 week off). The treatment was well-tolerated any typical adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) were noted. The parameters of the functional liver, the total cholesterol, and triglyceride were in normal ranges before and after therapy. After 3 cycles of the treatment, computed tomography (CT) scan revealed signs of fatty liver. After a 10-cycle course, CAP was substituted with tamoxifen because of the further aggravation of fatty liver.
OUTCOMES: Several months after withdrawal, the follow-up CT scans demonstrated significant improvement of fatty liver.

Reductions in tobacco use, uptake of preventive measures, adoption of early detection methods, and better treatments have resulted in improved cancer outcomes for men and women. Despite this progress, some population groups continue to experience an excessive cancer burden when compared with other population groups. One of the most prominent cancer health disparities exists in prostate cancer. Prostate cancer mortality rates are highest among men of African ancestry when compared with other men, both in the United States and globally. This disparity and other cancer health disparities are largely explained by differences in access to health care, diet, lifestyle, cultural barriers, and disparate exposures to carcinogens and pathogens. Dietary and lifestyle factors, pathogens, and ancestry-related factors can modify tumor biology and induce a more aggressive disease. There are numerous examples of how environmental exposures, like tobacco, chronic stress, or dietary factors, induce an adverse tumor biology, leading to a more aggressive disease and decreased patient survival. Because of population differences in the exposure to these risk factors, they can be the cause of cancer disparities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) seen in the neuro-oncology unit at a cancer referral center from April 2010 to November 2016 were included; demographic, oncologic diagnosis, risk factors, and prognostic considerations were presented as well.
RESULTS: We report on 256 patients with CVD and cancer, of whom 66% were women. The mean age at the time CVD occurred was 56 years. The most frequently associated malignancies were gynecologic (including breast cancer), hematologic, head and neck, and urologic. The men had more smoking and alcohol consumption history, hemorrhagic CVD, and urologic and hematologic malignancies. The women, besides gynecologic cancer, had more ischemic CVD. Thrombotic CVD, followed by embolic and hemorrhagic CVDs, was more frequent. A comorbid condition besides cancer was found in 71% of the patients.

Available data suggest that incidence and mortality in high-resource countries has been declining whereas incidence and mortality in low-resource countries has been increasing. This pattern is likely to be due to changing risk factor profiles and differences in access to breast cancer early detection and treatment. Risk factors for breast cancer include increasing age, race, menarche history, breast characteristics, reproductive patterns, hormone use, alcohol use, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, and body habitus. Mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 tumor suppressor genes are significantly associated with the development of breast and ovarian cancer by the age of 70. Survival depends on both stage and molecular subtype. As there are few signs and symptoms early on, early detection is an important strategy to improve outcomes. Major professional organizations in the United States and elsewhere recommend screening with mammography with appropriate follow up for an abnormal screening test, although they differ somewhat by recommended ages and frequency of screening. Studies suggest a 15%-40% mortality reduction secondary to screening, however, there are also concerns about harms, such as overdiagnosis (5%-54%) and overtreatment leading to long term complications, and false negatives (6%-46%).

The present study was subjected to gain more in-depth insight into breast cancer survivors' (BCS) HB and its associations with patient quality of life (QOL) outcome. We investigated HB focusing on eating disturbances comparing the latter with a reference population sample (PS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research cohort included 303 BCS completing a comprehensive patient-reported-outcome assessment on HB (eating disturbances, exercise, substance use) and QOL. Data from an age- and education-matched reference PS (n = 303) on eating disturbances were included.
RESULTS: Overall, 30% of BCS were overweight; 11.7% of BCS (2-11 years after diagnosis, mean = 5.2 years) reported eating disturbances compared with 5% of PS (P < .05). Approximately three-fourths of BCS indicated they exercise regularly, one-fourth smoke regularly, and 30% consume alcohol. Lower consumption of analgesics and tranquilizers, higher frequency of exercise, lower eating concern (EDE-Q), younger age, and lower body mass index were significant predictors for better physical QOL.

Evidence is lacking on the safety of breast reconstructive operations in these patients. We hypothesized that targeted HER-2 therapy was not associated with post-mastectomy reconstructive outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Women receiving chemotherapy and post-mastectomy reconstruction at Duke University Medical Center from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively identified. Patients receiving targeted HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab within 6 weeks before breast reconstruction were propensity score-matched 1:1 to patients who did not receive targeted HER-2 therapy, based on the following factors: age, obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy regimen, and radiation therapy. Primary study outcomes included the occurrence of hematoma, seroma, infection, wound breakdown, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, and postoperative flap thrombosis.
RESULTS: A total of 481 women were identified, resulting in 107 propensity score-matched pairs. Administration of combined trastuzumab and pertuzumab therapy before breast reconstruction was independently associated with increased risk of postoperative wound breakdown requiring operative intervention for closure, compared with patients not undergoing targeted HER-2 therapy (odds ratio 65.29; 95% CI 1.63 to 2,611.50; p = 0.03). In addition, larger tumor size (2 to 5 cm) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of postoperative wound breakdown, compared with smaller tumors (<2 cm) (odds ratio 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p = 0.02). Single-agent targeted HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab was not significantly associated with reconstructive complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that trastuzumab therapy in conjunction with breast reconstructive operation is not associated with reconstructive complications, and breast reconstruction does not need to be delayed due to the administration of trastuzumab. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of pertuzumab on surgical outcomes.","2017",,"J Am Coll Surg",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737, Combined Modality Therapy, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mammaplasty, TRUE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Molecular Targeted Therapy, TRUE, Propensity Score, FALSE, Receptor, ErbB-2, TRUE, analysis, Q000032, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Trastuzumab, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Treatment Outcome, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: The analysis data are derived from 68 participants of the lifestyle intervention study LIBRE-1, a randomized, prospective trial that aimed to test the feasibility of a lifestyle modification in BRCA 1 and 2 mutation carriers. At study entry, factors such as medical history, lifestyle behavior, and socioeconomic status were retrospectively documented by interview and the current BMI was determined by clinical examination. The baseline measurements were compared within the cohort, and presented alongside reference values for the German population.
RESULTS: Study participants indicating a higher physical activity during their adolescence showed a significantly lower cancer prevalence (p = 0.019). A significant difference in cancer occurrence was observed in those who smoked prior to the disease, and those who did not smoke (p < 0.001). Diseased mutation carriers tended to have a lower BMI compared to non-diseased mutation carriers (p = 0.079), whereas non-diseased revealed a significantly higher physical activity level than diseased mutation carriers (p = 0.046).
DISCUSSION: The present data in this small cohort of 68 mutation carriers suggest that smoking and low physical activity during adolescence are risk factors for developing breast cancer in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

Therefore, we compared all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality for elderly patients with breast cancer with and without mental illness. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using SEER-Medicare data, including 19,028 women ≥ 68 years of age who were diagnosed with stage I to IIIa breast cancer in the United States from 2005 to 2007. Patients were classified as having severe mental illness if an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification code for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorder was recorded on at least one inpatient or two outpatient claims during the 3 years before breast cancer diagnosis. Patients were followed for up to 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis to assess survival outcomes, which were then compared with those of patients without mental illness. Results Nearly 3% of patients had preexisting severe mental illness. We observed a two-fold increase in the all-cause mortality hazard between patients with severe mental illness compared with those without mental illness after adjusting for age, income, race, ethnicity, geographic location, and marital status (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.84 to 2.60). A 20% increase in breast cancer-specific mortality hazard was observed, but the association was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.74).

,"28881410","How alcohol industry organisations mislead the public about alcohol and cancer.","Petticrew M","INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Alcohol consumption increases the risk of several types of cancer, including several common cancers. As part of their corporate social responsibility activities, the alcohol industry (AI) disseminates information about alcohol and cancer. We examined the information on this which the AI disseminates to the public through its 'social aspects and public relations organizations' and related bodies. The aim of the study was to determine its comprehensiveness and accuracy.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Qualitative analysis of websites and documents from 27 AI organisations. All text relating to cancer was extracted and analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Most of the organisations were found to disseminate misrepresentations of the evidence about the association between alcohol and cancer. Three main industry strategies were identified: (i) denial/omission: denying, omitting or disputing the evidence that alcohol consumption increases cancer risk; (ii) distortion: mentioning cancer, but misrepresenting the risk; and (iii) distraction: focussing discussion away from the independent effects of alcohol on common cancers. Breast cancer and colorectal cancer appeared to be a particular focus for this misrepresentation.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The AI appears to be engaged in the extensive misrepresentation of evidence about the alcohol-related risk of cancer. These activities have parallels with those of the tobacco industry. This finding is important because the industry is involved in developing alcohol policy in many countries, and in disseminating health information to the public, including schoolchildren. Policymakers, academics, public health and other practitioners should reconsider the appropriateness of their relationships to these AI bodies.","2018",,"Drug Alcohol Rev","INTRODUCTION AND AIMS : Alcohol consumption increases the risk of several types of cancer , including several common cancers ","other","Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Alcoholic Beverages, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Deception, TRUE, Food Industry, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Public Health, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"28874120","The association between smoking and breast cancer characteristics and outcome.","Goldvaser H","BACKGROUND: Smoking is associated with an increased incidence of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Data regarding worse breast cancer outcome in smokers are accumulating. Current literature regarding the impact of smoking on breast cancer characteristics is limited. We evaluated the impact of smoking on breast cancer characteristics and outcome.
METHODS: This was a retrospective single center study. All women diagnosed from 4/2005 through 3/2012 and treated in our institute for early, estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer, whose tumors were sent for Oncotype DX analysis were included. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinico-pathological parameters, treatment and outcome. Data regarding smoking were retrieved according to patients' history at the first visit in the oncology clinic. Patients were grouped and compared according to smoking history (ever smokers vs. never smokers), smoking status (current vs. former and never smokers) and smoking intensity (pack years ≥30 vs. the rest of the cohort). Outcomes were adjusted in multivariate analyses and included age, menopausal status, ethnicity, tumor size, nodal status and grade.
RESULTS: A total of 662 women were included. 28.2% had a history of smoking, 16.6% were current smokers and 11.3% were heavy smokers. Smoking had no impact on tumor size, nodal involvement and Oncotype DX recurrence score. Angiolymphatic and perineural invasion rates were higher in current smokers than in the rest of the cohort (10.4% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.045, 8.3% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.031, respectively). Smoking had no other impact on histological characteristics. Five-year disease free survival and overall survival rates were 95.7% and 98.5%, respectively. Smoking had no impact on outcomes. Adjusted disease free survival and overall survival did not influence the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking had no clinically significant influence on tumor characteristics and outcome among women with estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative, early breast cancer. As the study was limited to a specific subgroup of the breast cancer population in this heterogeneous disease and since smoking is a modifiable risk factor for the disease, further research is required to clarify the possible impact of smoking on breast cancer.","2017",,"BMC Cancer",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lymphatic Metastasis, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasm Grading, FALSE, Neoplasm Staging, FALSE, Population Surveillance, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Smoking, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009, Treatment Outcome, FALSE, Tumor Burden, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Recently published data are now suggesting that smoking might increase both the overall mortality in women diagnosed with breast cancer but also increase their risk of dying from their breast cancer.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis on smoking status in women diagnosed with breast cancer, their mortality rate and cause of death. Based on all cohort studies published within the last ten years.
RESULTS: Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria, and 400,944 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer was included. Hazard ratio (HR) for breast cancer associated death in former smokers was 1.02 (0.93, 1.12) and for current smokers 1.28 (1.17, 1.41) when compared to never smokers. For all-cause death, the HR for former smokers was 1.12 (1.04, 1.19), and for current smokers 1.52 (1.32, 1.76) when compared to never smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: This large systematic review and meta-analysis found a 28% increase in breast cancer-associated mortality in those who were current smokers compared to never smokers. The mortality in former smokers was equal to the one found in never smokers. This indicates that breast cancer patients ceasing to smoke can lower their risk of dying from their breast cancer disease dramatically, and possibly regain the risk of a never smoker.","2017",,"Gland Surg",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: We used the data from a nationwide Danish Nurse Cohort on 21,867 female nurses (age > 44 years) who at recruitment in 1993 or 1999 reported information on smoking status, onset, duration, and intensity, as well as breast cancer risk factors. We obtained data on incidence of breast cancer from Danish Cancer Registry until 2013, and used Cox regression models to analyze the association between smoking and breast cancer.
RESULTS: Of 21,831 women (mean age 53.2 years) 1162 developed breast cancer during 15.7 years of follow-up. 33.7% of nurses were current and 30.0% former smokers at cohort baseline. Compared to never smokers, we found increased risk of breast cancer of 18% in ever (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval: 1.18; 1.04-1.34) and 27% in current (1.27; 1.11-1.46) smokers.

Still, there exists controversy concerning compromised radiation delivery plans and suboptimal delivery after immediate autologous breast reconstruction. Our study aims to assess the oncologic safety of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) with a Deep inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP), in the setting of adjuvant radiation therapy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis using a prospectively maintained database of all consecutive women undergoing breast reconstruction with a DIEP flap in the setting of radiation therapy. Independent variables included patient age, cancer stage, tumor grade type and subtype, adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use. Main outcome variables were: local recurrence, distant metastasis, patient demise and total flap failure.
RESULTS: From July 2008 to January 2014, and out of 450 patients who underwent reconstruction with a DIEP flap, 62 were considered eligible. Thirty patients (48%) had IBR followed by radiation therapy and 32 (52%) had delayed reconstruction preceded by radiation therapy. The two groups were comparable with respect to the independent variables. Local recurrence occurred in 3.2% of patients; 3.3% in the immediate group and 3.1% in the delayed (P=0.963). Distant metastasis occurred in 6.4% of patients: 10% in the immediate group and 3.1% in the delayed (P=0.27). Breast cancer related mortality occurred in 4.8%: 6.7% in the immediate group and 3.1% in the delayed (P=0.52).

We conducted a longitudinal census-based national study to quantify the relative inequality in cancer mortality among educational levels in Italy.
METHODS: We linked the 2011 Italian census with the 2012 and 2013 death registries. Educational inequality in overall cancer and site-specific cancer mortality were evaluated by computing the mortality rate ratio (MRR).
RESULTS: A total of 35,708,445 subjects aged 30-74 years and 147,981 cancer deaths were registered. Compared to the lowest level of education (none or primary school), the MRR for all cancers in the highest level (university) was 0.57 (95% CI 0.55; 0.58) in men and 0.84 (95% CI 0.81; 0.87) in women. Higher education was associated with reduced risk of mortality from lip, oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon and liver in both sexes. Higher education (university) was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer in men (MRR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.41; 0.46), but not in women (MRR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.92; 1.10). Highly educated women had a reduced risk of mortality from cervical cancer than lower educated women (MRR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.27; 0.56), but they had a similar risk for breast cancer (MRR: 1.01, 95% CI 0.94; 1.09).

METHODS: Female breast cancer patients in Korea who underwent breast conservation surgery followed by RT from 1990-2012 were identified from two large registries at institution and population levels. Cumulative incidences of acute coronary events (ACE) or cardiac mortality were estimated in relation to the laterality of breast cancer using a competing risks analysis.
RESULTS: In an analysis of 2577 women from a single institution, 3.7% were obese (body mass index ≥30), and 3.4% were ever-smokers. Patients with a history of hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease were 17.5, 5.7, and 2.8%, respectively. The mean heart doses were 6.2 and 1.5 Gy for left- and right-sided tumors, respectively. With a median follow-up of 7 (range 1-23) years, the overall and breast cancer-specific survivals at 10 years were 94.9 and 96.5%, respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidence of ACE was 2.96%. The mean time to ACE was 5.2 ± 3.9 years (range 1-17). There was no clinically relevant difference in rates of ACE between left-sided and right-sided patients, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.16 (CI 0.59-2.29). An analysis of 24,235 women in a nationwide registry validated these negative findings with respect to cardiac mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.52 (CI 0.37-6.25). Increasing age, a higher body mass index, and a history of hypertension or ischemic heart disease were identified as risk factors.

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether a significant weight loss, of approximately 10%, would lead to beneficial changes in biomarkers associated with cancer and/or cancer recurrence, and quality of life (QOL) in overweight and obese BC survivors.
METHODS: This parallel-arm study took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from January 2009 until March 2010. Participants were overweight and obese postmenopausal BC survivors who had completed treatment at least 3 months prior to enrollment and who did not smoke. Twenty-one BC survivors were randomized, via a random number generator computer software, to a 1000-calorie deficit feeding and exercise intervention (CR) or a weight management counseling intervention (WM) for 12 weeks followed by a 6-week follow-up. Body weight, biomarkers, and QOL were measured at baseline, weeks 6, 12, and 18. Body composition and fitness level were measured at only two time points.
RESULTS: Twenty-one women were enrolled into the study and 20 completed all time points. Weight loss occurred with both interventions. Body weight in CR changed from 85.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 77, 94) kg to 76.7 (95% CI 68.1, 85.2) kg, whereas in WM it changed from 98.3 (95% CI 89.8, 106.8) kg to 93.2 (95% CI 84.6, 101.7) kg. Fitness in CR changed from 4.9 (95% CI 4, 5.8) to 6.3 (95% CI 5.4, 7.2). CR led to lower plasma levels of leptin, F2-isoprostanes, and CRP. Quality of life seemed to improve with both interventions, while sleep quality decreased only in CR.
CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obese BC survivors were able to adhere to a strict diet and exercise program, which significantly decreased body weight, increased fitness level, and improved biomarkers and QOL. However, the strict dietary intervention in CR seemed to decrease participants' sleep quality and social relationships. Future larger randomized controlled trials should focus on behavioral modification and personalized nutrition counseling to help breast cancer survivors achieve a sustainable weight loss and fitness level.

METHODS: BC patients from 2000 to 2014 treated with NAC followed by SSM/NSM and IR were reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, NAC response, complications, and recurrence were analyzed.
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients with 280 BCs were treated with NAC followed by SSM (94%) or NSM (6%) with IR. Median age was 47 (26-72) years with a median follow-up of 45 months. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was noted in 49 (17.5%) cases. Overall 30-day complication rate was 13.2%. Variables associated with complications included BMI (P < 0.0001), tobacco use (P = 0.015), and adjuvant radiation (P = 0.025). Local-regional recurrence was 3.2% and metastatic recurrence was 13.2%.

,"28689518","Colon Cancer Screening - Is It Time Yet?","Bhurgri H","The month of March is dedicated to Colon Cancer Awareness. Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has been on the rise. It is currently the third most common cancer in men (746,000 cases, 10.0% of the total) and the second in women (614,000 cases, 9.2% of the total).1 Arecent meta-analysis reported a 61% risk reduction in CRC incidence with colonoscopy.2 Unlike screening programs for breast and prostate cancers, not only has CRC screening reduced mortality from colon cancer and detected early CRC, it has also decreased the incidence of CRC through detection and removal of pre-cancerous lesions. Studies have shown that screening for colorectal cancer provided 152 to 313 life-years-gained (LYG) per 1000 forty-year-old individuals.3 Anumber of modalities exist for CRC screening, which can broadly be categorized into stool-based tests and direct visualization tests. Stool-based tests include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and stool DNAtesting. Direct visualization tests include endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy; and radiographic tests such as CT colonography, which has largely replaced air contrast barium enemas.4 The only reported population-based data for CRC in Pakistan comes from Bhurgri et al. in 2011.5It described Pakistan as a low risk region with an age standardized incidence rate (ASR) world per 100,000 of 7.1 in males and 5.2 in females, but with a much younger age and advanced stage at diagnosis. The ratio for individuals diagnosed with CRC under the age of 40, as oppose to over 40 years, was 3:1, which is much higher than the international average. Noteworthy as well, is an increase in incidence especially among men, noted between the study periods of 1995-1997 and 1997-2002. It ranks 7th in incidence among males, and 8th among females, with tobacco related malignancies topping the list.6 There has since been additional cross-sectional data from Pakistan echoing these findings of a younger age and advanced disease at presentation.7 Speaking from a public health perspective, Pakistan, while still battling communicable diseases, is now seeing an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases population-based screening programs for CRC were not justified in most developing countries, citing low reported incidence and low resource health authorities; but that in limited regions with an ageing population and a shift to Western lifestyle, organized screening strategies needed to be developed. This can well be extrapolated to large urban centers in Pakistan. In a resource poor, conservative country like Pakistan, with poor health literacy, there exist many barriers to CRC screening which were summed up very articulately by Ahmed F in 2013. Quite appropriately, areas identified for further pursuit included, among others, the training of gastroenterologists, especially female ones, less expensive and more culturally acceptable screening options, and cost-effectiveness analyses. The recipe for any cancer screening program to be successful, begins with epidemiological data to document disease burden. There has not been any population-based cancer registry to report incidence data for the past few years. There is also no centralized cancer registry to effectively unify and coordinate data from across the country. Furthermore, even with a cancer registry there is no mandated reporting of malignancies from a health policy standpoint, as exists in the more developed world. The last population-based data we have for CRC was for cases reported until 2002, and there was already an increase in incidence noted in less than a decade, starting in 1995.5 Health awareness is another important factor. There is no data from Pakistan regarding patient or physician awareness regarding colon cancer. If one is to extrapolate, a cross-sectional study on breast cancer awareness, for which Pakistan demonstrates one of the highest incidences worldwide,6 reported that a mammogram had been performed in only 4.9 % of women in the cohort, while 61.5 % of the remainder had never even heard about it.7 It is also unclear if we have the infrastructure including endoscopy centers and adequate numbers of gastroenterologists to service the population at large. FOBTis available and cheap, but there is no data regarding the availability of FITor stool DNAtesting. In the absence of health insurance, it will certainly be a challenge to make CRC screening widely accessible. At what point does a disease warrant attention? While we may not have the luxury or the immediate necessity to introduce mass population-based CRC screening, we can certainly start with individual screening in populations who are at high risk of colorectal cancer due to family history and have adequate access to healthcare. There should be a concerted drive to revitalize cancer registration in order to guide health policy and to have an effective national cancer control program. Awareness programs are also needed to be established for the public and, specifically, for physicians as well.","2017",,"J Coll Physicians Surg Pak",,"other","Colonic Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Colonoscopy, FALSE, Cost-Benefit Analysis, FALSE, Early Detection of Cancer, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Mass Screening, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Occult Blood, FALSE, Pakistan, FALSE, Sigmoidoscopy, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Therefore, these issues should be addressed with a great sense of urgency with low-cost and simple approaches. Over the past several years, the scientific community has attempted to find solutions to overcome this issue. Thus, a large number of excellent studies have been reported in this field, and summarizing these results and providing important roadmaps for future studies is currently of great importance. Finding an outstanding solution to address aforementioned issue would be of great value to the community and to the social. Tobacco contains thousands of chemicals, and sixty-nine compounds have been established as human carcinogens; specifically, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is the strongest carcinogen among the tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Tobacco carcinogens are also linked to mammary gland pathogenesis and increased risk of developing many cancers, including breast cancer, the most common cancer in women worldwide.

Previous studies in flight attendants have found increased incidence of breast cancer and melanoma. However, there is little information on the relationship of airline travel and reproductive health in flight attendants. Secondhand smoke exposure has numerous negative health effects, such as increased cardiac events and respiratory infections, but its effect on reproductive health is not known. This study seeks to examine the role of secondhand smoke exposure on the miscarriage rate in flight attendants who flew before the smoking ban.
METHODS: Flight attendants who flew before the smoking ban and participating in a study of health effects of secondhand smoke were asked to complete a reproductive health survey. We compared miscarriage rates of flight attendants to the general population using 2010 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
RESULTS: In our cohort of 145 female flight attendants exposed to secondhand smoke, there were 45 miscarriages (26%), compared with a 17.1% rate in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report (P = .002). There was no difference in secondhand smoke exposure between the flight attendants with miscarriage and the group without miscarriage (P = .93).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found an increased incidence of miscarriage in flight attendants, which was unrelated to secondhand smoke exposure. Other factors, such as circadian rhythm disruption and radiation, may be related to these reproductive health findings and require further investigation.","2017",,"Am J Med",,"other","Abortion, Spontaneous, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Adult, FALSE, Aerospace Medicine, TRUE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Occupational Diseases, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Pregnancy, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Despite a lower breast cancer incidence compared with non-indigenous women, fatalities occur at an elevated rate and breast cancers have an earlier age of onset. For indigenous women there are also more advanced and distant tumours at diagnosis, fewer hospitalisations for breast cancer, and lower participation in breast screening. Concomitantly there are demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle factors associated with breast cancer risks that are heavily represented within Indigenous communities.

During the 7-year follow-up period, 305 women were diagnosed with first primary breast cancer in the EPIC-Spain cohort, and were compared with a sample of 149 women without breast cancer at recruitment, using a case-cohort approach. Aromatic adducts to DNA from leukocytes collected at recruitment were measured by means of the 32P-post-labelling technique. The relative risk and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted by relevant confounders, were estimated by a modified version of Cox proportional hazards model. There was a significant increased risk for developing breast cancer when DNA adduct concentrations were doubled, with adjusted RR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.29-2.01). The increase in breast cancer risk was observed both for pre- and post-menopausal women.

Using multivariable conditional logistic regression to estimate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), we examined the risk of CBC in relation to drinking and smoking history at and following first diagnosis. We adjusted for treatment, disease characteristics and other factors. There was some evidence for an association between CBC risk and current drinking or current smoking at the time of first breast cancer diagnosis, but the increased risk occurred primarily among women exposed to both (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.11). CBC risk was also elevated in women who both smoked and drank alcohol after diagnosis (RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.18-1.99).

The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the association between tobacco smoke and breast cancer with a focus on timing of exposure, especially during early life.
METHODS: Sister study participants (n = 50,884) aged 35-74 were enrolled from 2003 to 2009. Women in the United States and Puerto Rico were eligible if they were breast cancer-free but had a sister with breast cancer. Participants completed questionnaires on smoking and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for breast cancer risk.
RESULTS: During follow-up (mean = 6.4 years), 1,843 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed. Neither active smoking nor adult ETS was associated with breast cancer risk. However, never smoking women exposed to ETS throughout their childhood had a 17% higher risk of breast cancer (95% CI 1.00-1.36) relative to those with no exposure. In utero ETS exposure was also associated with breast cancer (HR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.32) and the HR was most elevated for women born in earlier birth cohorts (<1940, HR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.02-2.02; 1940-1949, HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.62).

This study prospectively investigated the efficacy of Double-Mirrored Omega Pattern (DMOP-SSM) compared to Wise Pattern SSM (WP-SSM) for immediate reconstruction in moderate/large-breasted smokers.
METHODS: From 2008-2010, DMOP-SSM was performed in 51 consecutive immediate breast reconstructions on 41 smokers (mean age = 49.8 years) with moderate/large and ptotic breasts. This active group (AG) was compared to a similar historical control group (CG) of 37 smokers (mean age = 51.1 years) who underwent WP-SSM and immediate breast reconstruction, with a mean follow-up of 37.6 months. Skin ischaemic complications, number of surgical revisions, time to wound healing, and patient satisfaction were analysed. Descriptive statistics were reported and comparison of performance endpoints was performed using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U-test. A p-value <.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Patients' mean age (p = .316) and BMI (p = .215) were not statistically different between groups. Ischaemic complications occurred in 11.7% of DMOP-SSMs and in 32.4% of WP-SSMs (p = .017), and revision rates were, respectively, 5.8% and 24.3% (p = .012), both statistically significant. Mean time to wound healing was, respectively, 16.8 days and 18.4 days (p = .205). Mean patients' satisfaction scores were, respectively, 18.9 and 21.1, statistically significant (p = .022).

Since fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are known regulators of stem cell markers in ER positive breast cancer, we investigated whether a link between the ER, FGFs, and stem cell markers exists in NSCLC. In lung preneoplasias and adenomas of tobacco carcinogen exposed mice, the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and/or the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole blocked FGF2 and FGF9 secretion, and reduced expression of the stem cell markers SOX2 and nanog. Mice administered β-estradiol during carcinogen exposure showed increased FGF2, FGF9, SOX2, and Nanog expression in airway preneoplasias. In normal FGFR1 copy number NSCLC cell lines, multiple FGFR receptors were expressed and secreted several FGFs. β-estradiol caused enhanced FGF2 release, which was blocked by fulvestrant. Upon co-inhibition of ER and FGFRs using fulvestrant and the pan-FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, phosphorylation of FRS2, the FGFR docking protein, was maximally reduced, and enhanced anti-proliferative effects were observed. Combined AZD4547 and fulvestrant enhanced lung tumor xenograft growth inhibition and decreased Ki67 and stem cell marker expression. To verify a link between ERβ, the predominant ER in NSCLC, and FGFR signaling in patient tumors, mRNA analysis was performed comparing high versus low ERβ expressing tumors. The top differentially expressed genes in high ERβ tumors involved FGF signaling and human embryonic stem cell pluripotency.

This review will detail the current statistics associated with cigarette smoking and discuss recent cohort and basic research studies that highlight the association of cigarette smoking and breast cancer initiation and progression.","2017",,"Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press)",," review","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved cancer death certification data and population figures from the World Health Organisation and Eurostat databases. Age-standardized (world standard population) rates were computed for France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK and the EU overall in 1970-2012. We obtained estimates for 2017 by implementing a joinpoint regression model.
RESULTS: The predicted number of cancer deaths for 2017 in the EU is 1 373 500, compared with 1 333 400 in 2012 (+3%). Cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline in both sexes, reaching 131.8/100 000 men (-8.2% when compared with 2012) and 84.5/100 000 women (-3.6%). Mortality rates for all selected cancer sites are predicted to decline, except pancreatic cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in women. In men, pancreatic cancer rate is stable, in women it increases by 3.5%. Lung cancer mortality rate in women is predicted to rise to 14.6/100 000 in 2017 (+5.1% since 2012, corresponding to 92 300 predicted deaths), compared with 14.0/100 000 for breast cancer, corresponding to 92 600 predicted deaths. Only younger (25-44) women have favourable lung cancer trends, and rates at this age group are predicted to be similar in women (1.4/100 000) and men (1.2/100 000). In men lung cancer rates are predicted to decline by 10.7% since 2012, and falls are observed in all age groups.
CONCLUSION: European cancer mortality projections for 2017 confirm the overall downward trend in rates, with a stronger pattern in men. This is mainly due to different smoking prevalence trends in different generations of men and women. Lung cancer rates in young European women are comparable to those in men, confirming that smoking has the same impact on lung cancer in the two sexes.","2017",,"Ann Oncol",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, European Union, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Forecasting, TRUE, France, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Germany, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Humans, FALSE, Italy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, Spain, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"28275920","Breast tumor DNA methylation patterns associated with smoking in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study.","Conway K","PURPOSE: Tobacco smoking is a risk factor in several cancers, yet its roles as a putative etiologic exposure or poor prognostic factor in breast cancer are less clear. Altered DNA methylation contributes to breast cancer development and may provide a mechanistic link between smoking and gene expression changes leading to cancer development or progression.
METHODS: Using a cancer-focused array, we examined methylation at 933 CpGs in 517 invasive breast tumors in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study to determine whether methylation patterns differ by exposure to tobacco smoke. Multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to compare tumor methylation profiles between smokers and never smokers, overall, or stratified on hormone receptor (HR) status.
RESULTS: Modest differences in CpG methylation were detected at p < 0.05 in breast tumors from current or ever smokers compared with never smokers. In stratified analyses, HR- tumors from smokers exhibited primarily hypomethylation compared with tumors from never smokers; hypomethylation was similarly detected within the more homogeneous basal-like subtype. Most current smoking-associated CpG loci exhibited methylation levels in former smokers that were intermediate between those in current and never smokers and exhibited progressive changes in methylation with increasing duration of smoking. Among former smokers, restoration of methylation toward baseline (never smoking) levels was observed with increasing time since quitting. Moreover, smoking-related hypermethylation was stronger in HR+ breast tumors from blacks than in whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that breast tumor methylation patterns differ with tobacco smoke exposure; however, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.","2017",,"Breast Cancer Res Treat"," PURPOSE : Tobacco smoking is a risk factor in several cancers , yet its roles as a putative etiologic exposure or poor prognostic factor in breast cancer are less clear ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, CpG Islands, FALSE, DNA Methylation, TRUE, DNA, Neoplasm, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Female, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, FALSE, Gene Ontology, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Promoter Regions, Genetic, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Transcriptome, FALSE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Physical activity (PA) has been shown to reduce such risks. The current analyses sought to identify: 1) unique patterns of PA among breast cancer survivors; and 2) characteristics associated with the level of PA.
METHODS: A total of 548 women reported PA and sociodemographic, health-related, and psychosocial factors at 3 time points, 6 months apart, after primary treatment of breast cancer. Cancer-related factors were obtained from chart reviews. Finite mixture modeling was used to examine trajectory groups of moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) in the early posttreatment period. The authors then examined the characteristics associated with trajectory group membership.
RESULTS: Three groups with distinct, stable patterns of PA were identified: the low MVPA (42.5% of patients), medium MVPA (45.5% of patients), and high MVPA (12.0% of patients) groups. In a multivariable setting, compared with more active breast cancer survivors, the least active group was found to have a higher body mass index, were less likely to report alcohol consumption, were more likely to smoke cigarettes, and had worse physical functioning and vitality scores. Cancer treatment-related factors did not significantly predict group membership.
CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of breast cancer survivors remain physically inactive after treatment, suggesting the need for interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population.

A sample of 70 patients (stratified by sex) aged 40-70years was randomly chosen from each physician's patient panel and asked to complete a questionnaire about their social position and health behaviors: tobacco and alcohol use, diet, physical activity, and participation in breast and cervical cancer screening. Each physician reported their practices related to each such behavior of each patient. Mixed models were used to test for social differences. Questionnaires were collected in 2008-2009 from both patient and physician for 71% of the 3640 patients. Our results showed social inequalities disfavored those at the bottom of the social scale for all but one of the health behaviors studied among both men and women (exception: excessive alcohol consumption among women). Physicians' practices related to these health behaviors also appeared to be socially differentiated. Among men, this differentiation favored those with the lowest social position for all behaviors except physical activity. Among women, however, practices favored the most disadvantaged only for breast cancer screening. In all other cases, they were either socially neutral or unfavorable to the most disadvantaged.

Although some studies suggest that breast cancer risk is related to passive smoking, little is known about the association with breast cancer by tumor hormone receptor status. We aimed to explore the association between lifetime passive smoking and risk of breast cancer subtypes defined by estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status among non-smoking Caucasian women. A hospital-based case-control study was performed in 585 cases and 1170 controls aged 28-90 years. Information on lifetime passive smoking and other factors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Logistic regression was used for analyses restricted to the 449 cases and 930 controls who had never smoked actively. All statistical tests were two-sided. Adjusted odds ratio of breast cancer was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-1.41) in women who experienced exposure to passive smoking at work, 1.88 (95% CI: 1.38-2.55) in women who had exposure at home, and 2.80 (95% CI: 1.84-4.25) in women who were exposed at home and at work, all compared with never exposed regularly. Increased risk was associated with longer exposure: women exposed ≤ 20 years and > 20 years had 1.27 (95% CI: 0.97-1.66) and 2.64 (95% CI: 1.87-3.74) times higher risk of breast cancer compared with never exposed (Ptrend < 0.001). The association of passive smoking with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer did not differ from that with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (Pheterogeneity > 0.05). There was evidence of interaction between passive smoking intensity and menopausal status in both overall group (P = 0.02) and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer group (P < 0.05). In Caucasian women, lifetime exposure to passive smoking is associated with the risk of breast cancer independent of tumor hormone receptor status with the strongest association in postmenopausal women.","2017",,"PLoS One"," Although some studies suggest that breast cancer risk is related to passive smoking , little is known about the association with breast cancer by tumor hormone receptor status ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Environmental Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lithuania, FALSE, Logistic Models, FALSE, Menopause, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Receptors, Estrogen, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Receptors, Progesterone, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Risk Factors, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, White People, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We performed this systematic review of available epidemiological studies to clarify the association between digitalis use and the risk of breast cancer.
METHODS: A search of studies published through May 2016 in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed, supplemented by manual searches of reference lists. The quality of the included studies was assessed, and relative risks were pooled using both random- and fixed-effect models.
RESULTS: Three case-control studies and six cohort studies were identified. Meta-analysis generated a pooled relative risk of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.24-1.46) in both fixed- and random-effect models. The heterogeneity test suggested low heterogeneity across studies. The funnel plot suggested no existence of publication bias. Subgroup analysis by study design revealed an increased risk of breast cancer associated with digitalis use from cohort studies only (relative risk = 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.27-1.52), rather than from case-control studies.

The cumulative risks of SPC were computed for different follow-up times. For comparison purpose, the same method was used to estimate the probability of cancer in the general population.
RESULTS: In this population-based cohort, 27,320 patients presented with a SPC.

METHODS: The Spanish Network of Cancer Registries (REDECAN) estimated the numbers of new cancer cases occurred in Spain in 2015 by applying the incidence-mortality ratios method. In the calculus, incidence data from population-based cancer registries and mortality data of all Spain were used.
RESULTS: In 2015, nearly a quarter of a million new invasive cancer cases were diagnosed in Spain, almost 149,000 in men (60.0%) and 99,000 in women. Globally, the five most common cancers were those of colon-rectum, prostate, lung, breast and urinary bladder. By gender, the four most common cancers in men were those of prostate (22.4%), colon-rectum (16.6%), lung (15.1%) and urinary bladder (11.7%). In women, the most common ones were those of breast (28.0%), colon-rectum (16.9%), corpus uteri (6.2%) and lung (6.0%). In recent years, cancer incidence in men seems to have stabilized due to the fact that the decrease in tobacco-related cancers compensates for the increase in other types of cancer like those of colon and prostate. In women, despite the stabilization of breast cancer incidence, increased incidence is due, above all, to the rise of colorectal and tobacco-related cancers.

METHODS: To address these issues, we pooled data from 14 cohort studies contributing 934 681 participants (36 060 invasive breast cancer cases). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Smoking duration before first birth was positively associated with risk ( P -value for trend = 2 × 10 -7 ) with the highest HR for initiation >10 years before first birth (HR = 1.18, CI 1.12-1.24). Effect modification by current alcohol consumption was evident for the association with smoking duration before first birth ( P -value=2×10 -4 ); compared with never-smoking non-drinkers, initiation >10 years before first birth was associated with risk in every category of alcohol intake, including non-drinkers (HR = 1.15, CI 1.04-1.28) and those who consumed at least three drinks per day (1.85, 1.55-2.21). Associations with smoking before first birth were limited to risk of ER+ breast cancer ( P -value for homogeneity=3×10 -3 ). Other smoking timing and duration characteristics were associated with risk even after controlling for alcohol, but were not associated with risk in non-drinkers.

Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results.
FINDINGS: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.","2017",,"JAMA Oncol"," OBJECTIVE : To estimate mortality , incidence , years lived with disability ( YLDs ) , years of life lost ( YLLs ) , and disability-adjusted life-years ( DALYs ) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015 ","other","Age Distribution, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Global Burden of Disease, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: All patients with DCIS treated with WLE alone at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA, between the years 2000 and 2010 were identified. We collected data on demographics, parity, personal or family history of breast cancer, exogenous hormone use, tobacco use, comorbidities, genetic mutation carrier status, imaging interval, and tumor-specific characteristics.
RESULTS: Overall, 222 patients were included in the study. Median follow-up time was 8 years. LR occurred in 9% of patients, with a recurrence rate of 11.3 per 1000 person-years. The risk of recurrence was lower for patients with nuclear grade (NG) I tumors than for patients with NG II or NG III tumors (3, 8.5, and 19%, respectively; p = 0.01). The median margin width was 1 mm in patients experiencing LR versus 1.8 mm in patients without LR (p = 0.3).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction; and the relationship between the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac therapy and/or echocardiographic parameters of systolic function at baseline and the development of cardiotoxicity in such patients.
METHODS: A total of 227 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in LV ejection fraction (EF) below 50% or an absolute decrease of >10 points below the baseline value or any indication of heart failure. Each patient underwent echocardiography at baseline and at follow-up every three months.
RESULTS: The prevalence of cardiotoxicity was 17.6% (15.4% asymptomatic, 2.2% symptomatic). Patients developing LV dysfunction presented hypertension (P=0.041) and diabetes (P=0.01) and used cardiac therapy at baseline more frequently. Smoke habit, age >50 and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, were independent predictors of cardiac damage. Furthermore, patients with LV dysfunction showed baseline LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) higher than those who did not and baseline EDV (OR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.04; P=0.027) independently predicted cardiotoxicity with 58 mL/m2 as best cut-off point (AUC=0.65, 95% CI: 0.55-0.75]).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer is relatively frequent, although asymptomatic in most cases. Baseline EDV resulted as independent predictor of cardiotoxicity suggesting that EDV may be more reliable than LVEF to identify patients at higher risk of developing cardiac damage.","2017",,"Minerva Cardioangiol"," The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of left ventricular ( LV ) systolic dysfunction ; and the relationship between the presence of cardiovascular risk factors , cardiac therapy and / or echocardiographic parameters of systolic function at baseline and the development of cardiotoxicity in such patients ","other","Adult, FALSE, Antineoplastic Agents, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Cardiotoxicity, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Echocardiography, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Receptor, ErbB-2, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Stroke Volume, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Trastuzumab, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Ventricular Dysfunction, Left, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Ventricular Function, Left, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Obesity is associated particularly with post-menopausal breast cancer. Diet is important, and exercise equivalent to running for up to 8 hours each week reduces the risk of breast cancer, both in its own right and through reducing obesity. Alcohol consumption may be responsible for 5.8% of breast cancers in Australia and it is recommended to reduce this to two standard drinks per day. Drinking alcohol and smoking increases the risk for breast cancer and, therefore, it is important to quit tobacco smoking. Prolonged use of combined oestrogen and progesterone hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives may increase breast cancer risk and this must be factored into individual decisions about their use. Ionising radiation, either from diagnostic or therapeutic radiation or through occupational exposure, is associated with a high incidence of breast cancer and exposure may be reduced in some cases. Tamoxifen chemoprevention may reduce the incidence of oestrogen receptor positive cancer in 51% of women with high risk of breast cancer. Uncommon but serious side effects include thromboembolism and uterine cancer. Raloxifene, which can also reduce osteoporosis, can be used in post-menopausal women and is not associated with the development of uterine cancer.

The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met correlates with aggressiveness of certain breast cancer phenotypes and thus considered a valid therapeutic target. This study reports the discovery and optimization of the tobacco-based cembranoid 1 as a novel c-Met inhibitory scaffold using combined structure- and ligand-based approaches. 1 displayed antiproliferative, anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects against the c-Met overexpressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at moderate μM concentrations. The Z'-LYTE kinase platform and Western blot analysis identified c-Met as a potential macromolecular target. Rationally designed carbamate analogs were proposed to probe additional targeted c-Met interactions and improve the cellular potency. The 6-phenyl carbamate 3 showed enhanced c-Met inhibitory activity. Structure-activity relationships of different substituents on the 3's phenyl moiety were studied. The most active analog 20 showed potent in vitro anticancer activity against the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at low μM concentrations, with minimal toxicity on the non-tumorigenic MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. Cembranoid 20 potently inhibited the c-Met catalytic activity in Z'-LYTE kinase assay and various cellular c-Met-driven signaling pathways. Furthermore, 20 displayed a robust antitumor activity in a breast cancer xenograft athymic mouse model and thus promoted to the lead rank.

METHODS: A population-based cohort of women (N = 1,508) diagnosed with first primary invasive or in situ breast cancer in 1996 to 1997 was interviewed shortly after diagnosis and again approximately 5 years later to assess ETS exposure, and women were followed for more than 18 years using the National Death Index; 597 deaths (237 associated with breast cancer) were identified. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality among women with breast cancer as related to at-diagnosis and at-/postdiagnosis changes in ETS exposure.
RESULTS: There was little or no association between at-diagnosis ETS exposure and all-cause (HR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.78-1.40) or breast cancer-specific (HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.63-1.52) mortality. Mortality was elevated among women who reported cessation in postdiagnosis ETS exposure up to 1 year before the follow-up assessment, for all-cause (HR = 1.81; 95% CI, 0.87-3.74) and breast cancer mortality (HR = 1.89; 95% CI, 0.68-5.24); however, estimates were imprecise.
CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence of an association between at-diagnosis ETS exposure and mortality after breast cancer. Postdiagnosis cessation of ETS exposure was positively associated with mortality, although we could not rule out chance and reverse causation as possible explanations.

Because LICs have limited financial resources, the value of screening must be carefully considered before integrating screening programs into national healthcare system. Mammography-the most commonly used screening tool in developed countries-reduces breast cancer-specific mortality among women of age group 50-69, but the evidence is not so clear for younger women. Further, it does not reduce the overall mortality. Because the women in LICs tend to get breast cancer at younger age and are faced with various competing causes of mortality, LICs need to seriously evaluate whether mammographic screening presents a good value for the investment. Instead, we suggest a special module of clinical breast examination that could provide similar benefits at a very low cost. Nevertheless, we believe that LICs would obtain a much greater value for their investment if they promote primary prevention by tobacco cessation, healthier food and healthier lifestyle campaigns instead.","2016",,"Cancer Causes Control",,"other","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Delivery of Health Care, FALSE, economics, Q000191, Developing Countries, FALSE, Early Detection of Cancer, FALSE, economics, Q000191, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mammography, FALSE, economics, Q000191, Mass Screening, FALSE, economics, Q000191, Poverty, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Psychological factors such as depression and anxiety are likely to be associated with smoking behavior following a cancer diagnosis, but the empirical evidence is scarce.
PURPOSE: This observational study aimed at estimating smoking cessation rates and assessing the effect of smoking cessation on psychological symptoms, as well as the predictive role of the same psychological variables on smoking cessation and smoking relapse following cancer surgery.
METHODS: As part of a larger prospective, epidemiological study, smokers (n = 175) with a first diagnosis of nonmetastatic cancer completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory. Quitters (n = 55) and pair-matched nonquitters (n = 55) were compared on each symptom at pre-quitting, post-quitting, and at a 4-month follow-up. Predictors of smoking cessation and smoking relapse, including psychological variables, were also investigated.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (31.4 %) stopped smoking at least on one occasion during the study. Of the 55 quitters, 27 (49.1 %) experienced a relapse. At pre-quitting, quitters had significantly higher levels of anxiety (p = .03) and fear of cancer recurrence (p = .01) than nonquitters, symptoms that significantly diminished at post-quitting and 4 months later in this subgroup of patients. Having breast cancer significantly predicted smoking cessation (relative risk [RR] = 3.08), while depressive symptoms were a significant predictor of smoking relapse (RR = 1.07).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of psychological symptoms in predicting tobacco cessation and relapse among individuals with cancer. Our findings suggest that breast cancer patients are more inclined to stop smoking than patients with other cancers, but future studies should attempt to delineate the effect on smoking cessation of gender and other demographics that characterize this subgroup. This study also suggests that a particular attention should be paid to the early management of depressive symptoms in order to prevent smoking relapse.","2017",,"Ann Behav Med"," PURPOSE : This observational study aimed at estimating smoking cessation rates and assessing the effect of smoking cessation on psychological symptoms , as well as the predictive role of the same psychological variables on smoking cessation and smoking relapse following cancer surgery ","observational study","Adult, FALSE, Anxiety, FALSE, psychology, Q000523, Depression, FALSE, psychology, Q000523, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Longitudinal Studies, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, psychology, Q000523, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Recurrence, FALSE, Smoking Cessation, FALSE, psychology, Q000523, Treatment Outcome, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

This study aimed to determine which cancers give rise to changing ethnic inequalities over time.
METHODS: New Zealand census data from 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006, were all probabilistically linked to three to five subsequent years of mortality (68 million person-years) and cancer registrations (87 million person years) and weighted for linkage bias. Age-standardised rate differences (SRDs) for Māori (indigenous) and Pacific peoples, each compared to European/Other, were decomposed by cancer type.
RESULTS: The absolute size and percentage of the cancer contribution to excess mortality increased from 1981-86 to 2006-11 in Māori males (SRD 72.5 to 102.0 per 100,000) and females (SRD 72.2 to 109.4), and Pacific females (SRD -9.8 to 42.2) each compared to European/Other. Specifically, excess mortality (SRDs) increased for breast cancer in Māori females (linear trend p < 0.01) and prostate (p < 0.01) and colorectal cancers (p < 0.01) in Māori males. The incidence gap (SRDs) increased for breast (Māori and Pacific females p < 0.01), endometrial (Pacific females p < 0.01) and liver cancers (Māori males p = 0.04), and for cervical cancer it decreased (Māori females p = 0.03). The colorectal cancer incidence gap which formerly favoured Māori, decreased for Māori males and females (p < 0.01). The greatest contributors to absolute inequalities (SRDs) in mortality in 2006-11 were lung cancer (Māori males 50 %, Māori females 44 %, Pacific males 81 %), breast cancer (Māori females 18 %, Pacific females 23 %) and stomach cancers (Māori males 9 %, Pacific males 16 %, Pacific females 20 %). The top contributors to the ethnic gap in cancer incidence were lung, breast, stomach, endometrial and liver cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: A transition is occurring in what diseases contribute to inequalities. The increasing excess incidence and mortality rates in several obesity- and health care access-related cancers provide a sentinel warning of the emerging drivers of ethnic inequalities. Action to further address inequalities in cancer burden needs to be multi-pronged with attention to enhanced control of tobacco, obesity, and carcinogenic infectious agents, and focus on addressing access to effective screening and quality health care.","2016",,"BMC Cancer"," This study aimed to determine which cancers give rise to changing ethnic inequalities over time ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We investigated the effect of smoking on hormonal therapy by performing in vitro experiments. We first prepared tobacco smoke condensate (TSC) and examined its effect on estrogen receptor (ER) activity. The ER activity was analyzed using MCF-7-E10 cells into which the estrogen-responsive element (ERE)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene had been stably introduced (GFP assay) and performing an ERE-luciferase assay. TSC significantly activated ERs, and upregulated its endogenous target genes. This activation was inhibited by fulvestrant but more weakly by tamoxifen. These results suggest that the activation mechanism may be different from that for estrogen. Furthermore, using E10 estrogen depletion-resistant cells (EDR cells) established as a hormonal therapy-resistant model showing estrogen-independent ER activity, ER activation and induction of ER target genes were significantly higher following TSC treatment than by estradiol (E2). These responses were much higher than those of the parental E10 cells. In addition, the phosphorylation status of signaling factors (ERK1/2, Akt) and ER in the E10-EDR cells treated with TSC increased. The gene expression profile induced by estrogenic effects of TSC was characterized by microarray analysis. The findings suggested that TSC activates ER by both ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Although TSC constituents will be metabolized in vivo, breast cancer tissues might be exposed for a long period along with hormonal therapy. Tobacco smoke may have a possibility to interfere with hormonal therapy for breast cancer, which may have important implications for the management of therapy.","2017",,"J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol"," We investigated the effect of smoking on hormonal therapy by performing in vitro experiments ","other","Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, TRUE, Estradiol, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Estrogen Receptor alpha, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogens, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Fulvestrant, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, FALSE, Genes, Reporter, FALSE, Green Fluorescent Proteins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Hormones, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Humans, FALSE, Ligands, FALSE, MCF-7 Cells, FALSE, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, FALSE, Phosphorylation, FALSE, Signal Transduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Smoke, TRUE, Tamoxifen, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Nicotiana, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

An updated review and meta-analysis.","Lee PN","CONTEXT: In 2006, we reviewed the evidence on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and breast cancer in nonsmoking women. Since then various studies and reviews have been published but opinion remains divided.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an updated review.
METHODS: We extracted study details, derived relative risk (RR) estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) for various ETS exposure indices, and conducted meta-analyses.
RESULTS: The update increased the number of studies from 22 to 47. Using an index for each study most closely equivalent to ""spouse ever smoked"", a weak but significant association was seen (random-effects RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.07-1.23). However, the estimates were heterogeneous: higher for Asian studies than for North American or European studies, higher for studies adjusting for fewer potential confounding variables, and close to 1.0 for prospective studies, regardless of whether or not they asked detailed questions on ETS exposure. The RR for eight prospective studies asking detailed questions was 1.003, 95% CI = 0.96-1.05. Risk was increased in premenopausal women (RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.15-1.60), but not postmenopausal women. Dose-response findings were similarly heterogeneous. No significant increase was seen for childhood or workplace exposure, but an increase was seen for total exposure (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.09-1.37).
CONCLUSIONS: Increases mainly derived from case-control studies are prone to recall bias. Study weaknesses and possible publication bias limit interpretation. Considering also the weak association of smoking with breast cancer, and the much lower exposures from ETS than from smoking, our analyses do not clearly demonstrate that ETS exposure increases risk of breast cancer in nonsmokers.

Incidence and mortality rates for cancer have risen steadily and cost the healthcare system over $264 billion annually. Cancer risk can be reduced by restricting alcohol consumption, avoiding tobacco, eating a balanced diet, limiting sun exposure, exercising, and seeking routine cancer screenings. The purpose of this study is to examine cancer risk factor knowledge among college students. Researchers surveyed undergraduate and graduate students (n = 758) at a mid-sized public university in the Southeast about their knowledge regarding cancer risk factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, obesity, hypertension, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Participants were mostly able to identify the association between cancers and health risk behaviors that have received widespread media coverage, are somewhat intuitive, or are salient to their life stage such as drinking, tanning, and smoking. Nearly all participants correctly reported exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays, and smoking increased risk of developing skin and lung cancer, respectively.

However, knowledge of less publicized relationships was insufficient. The findings offer encouragement to public health professionals that campaigns have increased awareness of cancer risk.

METHODS: In the middle of 2015, 261 cancer registries submitted reports on new cancer cases and deaths occurred in 2012. Qualified data from 193 registries were used for analysis after evaluation. Crude rates, number of cases, and age-standardized rates stratified by area (urban/rural), sex, age group, and cancer type were calculated according to the national population in 2012.
RESULTS: The covered population were 198,060,406 from 193 qualified cancer registries (74 urban and 119 rural registries). The major indicators of quality control, percentage of cases morphologically verified (MV%), death certificate-only cases (DCO%), and the mortality to incidence (M/I) ratio, were 69.13%, 2.38%, and 0.62, respectively. It was estimated that there were 3,586,200 new cancer cases and 2,186,600 cancer deaths in 2012 in China with an incidence of 264.85/100,000 [age-standardized rate of incidence by the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) of 191.89/100,000] and a mortality of 161.49/100,000 [age-standardized rate of mortality by the Chinese standard population (ASRMC) of 112.34/100,000]. The ten most common cancer sites were the lung, stomach, liver, colorectum, esophagus, female breast, thyroid, cervix, brain, and pancreas, accounting for approximately 77.4% of all new cancer cases. The ten leading causes of cancer death were lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, female breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, and lymphoma, accounting for 84.5% of all cancer deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous cancer registry data provides basic information in cancer control programs. The cancer burden in China is gradually increasing, both in urban and rural areas, in males and females. Efficient cancer prevention and control, such as health education, tobacco control, and cancer screening, should be paid attention by the health sector and the whole society of China.","2016",,"Chin J Cancer",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, China, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Registries, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The hypothesis that tumors could be hormonally induced during pregnancy or in young female patients without the well-known risk factors alcohol or tobacco abuse seems to be plausible.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression were analyzed in normal oral mucosa (n=5), oral precursor lesions (simple hyperplasia, n=11; squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, SIN I-III, n=35), and OSCC specimen. OSCCs were stratified in a young female (n=7) study cohort and older patients (n=46). In the young female study cohort three patients (n=3/7) developed OSCC during or shortly after pregnancy. Breast cancer tissues were used as positive control for ERα and PR expression.
RESULTS: ERα expression was found in four oral precursor lesions (squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, SIN I-III, n=4/35, 11%) and in five OSCC specimen (n=5/46, 11%). The five ERα positive OSCC samples were older male patients. All patients within the young female study cohort were negatively stained for both ERα and PR.

Because the breast is a symbol of femininity, breast reconstruction is critical to mitigating the psychosocial stigma of a breast cancer diagnosis. Whether different races have equitable access to breast reconstruction remains unknown.
METHODS: Two thousand five hundred thirty-three women underwent first-time autologous versus implant-based reconstruction following mastectomy. Information regarding age, smoking, diabetes, obesity, provider, race, pathologic stage, health insurance type, charge to insurance, and socioeconomic status was recorded. Established statistics compared group medians and proportions. A backward-stepwise multivariate logistic regression model identified independent predictors of breast reconstruction type.
RESULTS: Compared with whites, African Americans were more likely to be underinsured (p < 0.01), face a lesser charge for reconstruction (p < 0.01), smoke (p < 0.01), have diabetes (p < 0.01), suffer from obesity (p < 0.01), live in a zip code with a lower median household income (p < 0.01), and undergo autologous-based reconstruction (p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, only African American race (OR, 2.23; p < 0.01), charge to insurance (OR, 1.00; p < 0.01), and provider (OR, 0.96; p < 0.01) independently predicted type of breast reconstruction, whereas age (OR, 1.02; p = 0.06) and diabetes (OR, 0.48; p = 0.08) did not.
CONCLUSIONS: African American race remains the most clinically significant predictor of autologous breast reconstruction, even after controlling for age, obesity, pathologic stage, health insurance type, charge to patient, socioeconomic status, smoking, and diabetes. Future research may address whether this disparity stems from patient preferences or more profound sociocultural and economic forces, including discrimination.

SURVIVIN was found to be expressed in Q-BCSCs. Time dependant biphasic expression of SURVIVIN in Q-BCSCs reveals that Q-BCSCs is a pre-metastatic phase distinct from both epithelial and mesenchymal counterparts. SURVIVIN favours metastasis and up-regulates WNT/β-CATENIN pathway in a PI3 K/AKT-dependant manner for self-renewal. Knockdown of SURVIVIN in Q-BCSCs lost the metastatic property of cells by inhibiting invasion, EMT-MET, PI3 K/AKT/WNT cascade, and induced apoptosis.

In the majority of this work, a single nutrient-based approach has been used which does not take into account combinations of food that are consumed. An alternative to the single nutrient approach is to identify patterns in the dietary intake information and relate these patterns to disease incidence. This investigation characterized dietary patterns among participants of a Canadian case-control study and related these dietary patterns to the incidence of breast cancer.
METHODS: Dietary and other risk factor data from cases and controls of the Canadian National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Principal component factor analysis was used to classify individuals based on their dietary patterns. The relationship between these dietary patterns and breast cancer was evaluated using logistic regression. The derived odds ratios and their 95% confidence limits were adjusted for several factors, such as smoking, alcohol intake, environmental tobacco smoke exposure and obesity.
RESULTS: In the 2,009 cases and 2,086 controls, three dietary patterns were identified: western, healthy and vitamin. The highest quartile of the ""healthy"" dietary pattern was related to a 22% decrease in breast cancer risk (95% CI: 0.61-1.00), relative to the lowest quartile. The fourth quartile of the ""vitamin"" dietary pattern was associated with a 14% decrease in breast cancer risk (95% CI: 0.70-1.04) relative to the first. No statistically significant associations between the ""western"" dietary pattern and breast cancer were found. These associations were neither confounded nor modified by menopausal status.

A weaker association with total cancer (RR 1.13, 95%CI 1.03-1.35, n = 19) based on heterogeneous data is inconclusive.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate combined risk stratification utility of common low penetrant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epidemiologic risk factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a total of 17 171 cases and 19 862 controls sampled from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) and 5879 women participating in the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, a model for predicting absolute risk of breast cancer was developed combining information on individual level data on epidemiologic risk factors and 24 genotyped SNPs from prospective cohort studies, published estimate of odds ratios for 68 additional SNPs, population incidence rate from the National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry and data on risk factor distribution from nationally representative health survey. The model is used to project the distribution of absolute risk for the population of white women in the United States after adjustment for competing cause of mortality.
EXPOSURES: Single nucleotide polymorphisms, family history, anthropometric factors, menstrual and/or reproductive factors, and lifestyle factors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Degree of stratification of absolute risk owing to nonmodifiable (SNPs, family history, height, and some components of menstrual and/or reproductive history) and modifiable factors (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], menopausal hormone therapy [MHT], alcohol, and smoking).
RESULTS: The average absolute risk for a 30-year-old white woman in the United States developing invasive breast cancer by age 80 years is 11.3%. A model that includes all risk factors provided a range of average absolute risk from 4.4% to 23.5% for women in the bottom and top deciles of the risk distribution, respectively. For women who were at the lowest and highest deciles of nonmodifiable risks, the 5th and 95th percentile range of the risk distribution associated with 4 modifiable factors was 2.9% to 5.0% and 15.5% to 25.0%, respectively. For women in the highest decile of risk owing to nonmodifiable factors, those who had low BMI, did not drink or smoke, and did not use MHT had risks comparable to an average woman in the general population.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This model for absolute risk of breast cancer including SNPs can provide stratification for the population of white women in the United States. The model can also identify subsets of the population at an elevated risk that would benefit most from risk-reduction strategies based on altering modifiable factors.

METHODS: Thirty-eight female patients (age, 53 ± 9 years) undergoing immediate postmastectomy reconstruction were prospectively studied with informed consent. Blood was sampled preoperatively, on postoperative day 1, and at 1 week follow-up. Rotational thromboelastography clotting time, α-angle (clot kinetics), clot formation time, and maximum clot firmness were studied with three different activating agents: intrinsically activated test using ellagic acid, extrinsically activated test with tissue factor, and fibrin-based extrinsically activated test with tissue factor and the platelet inhibitor cytochalasin D. Thromboprophylaxis was unfractionated heparin plus sequential compression devices if not contraindicated. Hypercoagulability was defined by one or more parameters outside the reference range.
RESULTS: Preoperatively, 29 percent of patients were hypercoagulable, increasing to 67 percent by week 1 (p = 0.017). Clotting time, clot formation time, and α-angle remained relatively constant over time, but maximum clot formation increased in intrinsically activated test using ellagic acid, extrinsically activated test with tissue factor, and fibrin-based extrinsically activated test with tissue factor and the platelet inhibitor cytochalasin D (all p < 0.05). Body mass index was 28 ± 5 kg/m, 23 percent received preoperative chemotherapy, and 15 percent had a history of tobacco use, but there was no association between these risk factors and hypercoagulability.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite perioperative thromboprophylaxis, two-thirds of patients undergoing combined tumor resection and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer were hypercoagulable 1 week after surgery.

In 2015, cancer death rates were 26% lower than in 1990 (32% lower among men and 22% lower among women). The 50% reduction goal was more fully met for the cancer sites for which there was enactment of effective approaches for prevention, early detection, and/or treatment. Among men, mortality rates dropped for lung cancer by 45%, for colorectal cancer by 47%, and for prostate cancer by 53%. Among women, mortality rates dropped for lung cancer by 8%, for colorectal cancer by 44%, and for breast cancer by 39%. Declines in the death rates of all other cancer sites were substantially smaller (13% among men and 17% among women). The major factors that accounted for these favorable trends were progress in tobacco control and improvements in early detection and treatment.

,"27088617","Interaction between APC and Fen1 during breast carcinogenesis.","Narayan S","Aberrant DNA base excision repair (BER) contributes to malignant transformation. However, inter-individual variations in DNA repair capacity plays a key role in modifying breast cancer risk. We review here emerging evidence that two proteins involved in BER - adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) - promote the development of breast cancer through novel mechanisms. APC and Fen1 expression and interaction is increased in breast tumors versus normal cells, APC interacts with and blocks Fen1 activity in Pol-β-directed LP-BER, and abrogation of LP-BER is linked with cigarette smoke condensate-induced transformation of normal breast epithelial cells. Carcinogens increase expression of APC and Fen1 in spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cells, human colon cancer cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Since APC and Fen1 are tumor suppressors, an increase in their levels could protect against carcinogenesis; however, this does not seem to be the case. Elevated Fen1 levels in breast and lung cancer cells may reflect the enhanced proliferation of cancer cells or increased DNA damage in cancer cells compared to normal cells. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor functions of APC and Fen1 is due to their interaction, which may act as a susceptibility factor for breast cancer. The increased interaction of APC and Fen1 may occur due to polypmorphic and/or mutational variation in these genes. Screening of APC and Fen1 polymorphic and/or mutational variations and APC/Fen1 interaction may permit assessment of individual DNA repair capability and the risk for breast cancer development.

OBJECTIVES: This study considers the impact on breast cancer incidence from multiple PAH exposure sources in a single model, which better reflects exposure to these complex mixtures.
METHODS: In a population-based case-control study conducted on Long Island, New York (N=1508 breast cancer cases/1556 controls), a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach was used to estimate adjusted posterior means and credible intervals (CrI) for the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for PAH exposure sources, considered singly and as groups: active smoking; residential environmental tobacco smoke (ETS); indoor and outdoor air pollution; and grilled/smoked meat intake.
RESULTS: Most women were exposed to PAHs from multiple sources, and the most common included active/passive smoking and grilled/smoked food intake. In multiple-PAH source models, breast cancer incidence was associated with residential ETS from a spouse (OR=1.20, 95%CrI=1.03, 1.40) and synthetic firelog burning (OR=1.29, 95%CrI=1.06, 1.57); these estimates are similar, but slightly attenuated, to those from single-source models. Additionally when we considered PAH exposure groups, the most pronounced significant associations included total indoor sources (active smoking, ETS from spouse, grilled/smoked meat intake, stove/fireplace use, OR=1.45, 95%CrI=1.02, 2.04).

In this report, the American Cancer Society presents AANHPI cancer incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Among AANHPIs in 2016, there will be an estimated 57,740 new cancer cases and 16,910 cancer deaths. While AANHPIs have 30% to 40% lower incidence and mortality rates than non-Hispanic whites for all cancers combined, risk of stomach and liver cancers is double. The male-to-female incidence rate ratio among AANHPIs declined from 1.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.36-1.49) in 1992 to 1.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.07) in 2012 because of declining prostate and lung cancer rates in males and increasing breast cancer rates in females. The diversity within the AANHPI population is reflected in the disparate cancer risk by subgroup. For example, the overall incidence rate in Samoan men (526.5 per 100,000) is more than twice that in Asian Indian/Pakistani men (216.8). Variations in cancer rates in AANHPIs are related to differences in behavioral risk factors, use of screening and preventive services, and exposure to cancer-causing infections. Cancer-control strategies include improved use of vaccination and screening; interventions to increase physical activity and reduce excess body weight, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption; and subgroup-level research on burden and risk factors.

METHODS: For the 5,356 women (4,489 postmenopausal) from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (1993-1997) who attended mammographic screening in Copenhagen (1993-2001), we used MD (mixed/dense or fatty) assessed at the first screening after cohort entry. Active smoking (status, duration, and intensity) and passive smoking were assessed at cohort baseline (1993-1997) via questionnaire, together with other breast cancer risk factors. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations (odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals) between smoking and MD, adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: Two thousand and twenty-six (56.5 %) women had mixed/dense MD, 2,214 (41.4 %) were current, and 1,175 (21.9 %) former smokers. Current smokers had significantly lower odds (0.86, 0.75-0.99) of having mixed/dense MD compared to never smokers, while former smoking was not associated with MD.

To help countries expand locally appropriate services, Cancer (the third volume of nine in Disease Control Priorities, 3rd edition) developed an essential package of potentially cost-effective measures for countries to consider and adapt. Interventions included in the package are: prevention of tobacco-related cancer and virus-related liver and cervical cancers; diagnosis and treatment of early breast cancer, cervical cancer, and selected childhood cancers; and widespread availability of palliative care, including opioids. These interventions would cost an additional US$20 billion per year worldwide, constituting 3% of total public spending on health in low-income and middle-income countries.

If immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is systematically proposed, 81% of the patients would choose immediate versus delayed breast reconstruction, but the actual IBR rate is only approximately 50% of them. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify objective characteristics that distinguish the patients who actually underwent IBR from those who did not.
METHODS: Several criteria of 248 patients who have undergone mastectomy for ductal carcinoma were analyzed. Factors studied were age, body mass index, diabetes, tobacco use, and weight of the specimen of resection.
RESULTS: The rate of IBR was 43%. An increase in age and weight of the resection specimen, irrespective of the body mass index, was associated with a lower rate of IBR. Thus, an increase of 100 g in the weight of the breast induces a significant reduction of the IBR (33%).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, older patients or patients with larger breasts (irrespective of the body mass index) were less likely to undergo IBR. In order to be in line with the patient's desire, the surgeons of our unit should broaden their indications of IBR. The lack of reconstruction of large breasts should certainly be compensated in part with the recent development of free tissue transfers in our unit.

The carcinogenic and estrogenic activities of Cd make it a contaminant of potential concern for hormone-dependent cancers including breast cancer. Postmenopausal women represent the most appropriate population to investigate the possible impact of exogenous factors with potential estrogenic activity on breast cancer as, after menopause, their estrogenic influence is predominant.
OBJECTIVES: We systematically reviewed available studies on the association between dietary exposure to Cd and breast cancer focusing on postmenopausal women. A meta-analysis combining the risk estimators was performed and potential sources of between studies heterogeneity were traced.
METHODS: Studies were searched from MEDLINE through 31 January 2015 and from the reference lists of relevant publications. Six eligible studies published between 2012 and 2014 were identified and relative risk estimates were extracted. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect models. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, geographic location, use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), tumor estrogen receptor status (ER+ or ER-), progesterone receptor status (PGR+ or PGR-), body mass index (BMI), smoker status, zinc or iron intake.
RESULTS: No statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer was observed when all studies were combined (mRR=1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-1.19). Several sources of heterogeneity and inconsistency were identified, including smoker status, HRT use, BMI, zinc and iron intake. Inconsistency was also strongly reduced when only considering ER-, PGR-, tumors subgroups from USA and from Japan. The risks were, however, not substantially modified after stratifications. No evidence of publication bias was found.
CONCLUSION: The present study does not provide support for the hypothesis that dietary exposure to Cd increases the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Misclassification in dietary Cd assessment in primary studies could have biased the results towards a finding of no association.","2016",,"Environ Int"," Postmenopausal women represent the most appropriate population to investigate the possible impact of exogenous factors with potential estrogenic activity on breast cancer as , after menopause , their estrogenic influence is predominant ","meta analysis","Adult, FALSE, Body Mass Index, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cadmium, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Diet, FALSE, Environmental Exposure, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Environmental Pollutants, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Feeding Behavior, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Food Contamination, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Humans, FALSE, Japan, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Postmenopause, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Risk Assessment, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: In October-November 2012, we recruited men and women (18 years and older) from households and health facilities in three different parts of Western Kenya, chosen for variations in their documented burdens of breast cancer. A standardized and validated tool, the breast cancer awareness measure (BCAM), was administered in face-to-face interviews. Survey domains covered included socio-demographics, opinions about causes, symptoms, severity, and treatment of breast cancer. Descriptive analyses were done on quantitative data while open-ended answers were coded, and emerging themes were integrated into larger categories in a qualitative analysis. The open-ended questions had been added to the standard BCAM for the purposes of learning as much as the investigators could about underlying lay beliefs and perceptions.
RESULTS: Most respondents were female, middle-aged (mean age 36.9 years), married, and poorly educated. Misconceptions and lack of knowledge about causes of breast cancer were reported. The following (in order of higher to lower prevalence) were cited as potential causes of the condition: Genetic factors or heredity (n = 193, 12.3%); types of food consumed (n = 187, 11.9%); witchcraft and curses (n = 108, 6.9%); some family planning methods (n = 56, 3.6%); and use of alcohol and tobacco (n = 46, 2.9%). When asked what they thought of breast cancer's severity, the most popular response was ""it is a killer disease"" (n = 266, 19.7%) a lethal condition about which little or nothing can be done. While opinions about presenting symptoms and signs of breast cancer were able to be elicited, such as an increase in breast size and painful breasts, early-stage symptoms and signs were not widely recognized. Some respondents (14%) were ignorant of available treatment altogether while others felt breast cancer treatment is both dangerous and expensive. A minority reported alternative medicine as providing relief to patients.

METHODS: We examined associations of active and passive smoke exposure with mortality among Hispanic (n = 1020) and non-Hispanic white (n = 1198) women with invasive breast cancer in the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study (median follow-up of 10.6 years).
RESULTS: Risk of breast cancer-specific (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.11-2.16) and all-cause (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.30-2.17) mortality was increased for current smokers, with similar results stratified by ethnicity. Ever smokers had an increased risk of noncancer mortality (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.12-2.51). Associations were strongest for current smokers who smoked for 20 years or more were postmenopausal, overweight and/or obese, or reported moderate and/or high alcohol consumption; however, interactions were not significant.

The disease is caused by infectious and non-infectious, environmental and lifestyle factors. Tobacco smoke has been one of the most widely studied environmental factors with possible relevance to breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of tobacco smoking in breast cancer patients in a hospital based cohort and to establish prognostic implications if any.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective audit of 100 women with pathological diagnosis of invasive breast cancer was included in this study. The verbal questionnaire elicited information on current and previous history of exposure to smoking in addition to active smoking. All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders, including stage at presentation, alcohol intake, hormonal replacement therapy, oral contraceptive intake, obesity and menopausal status.
RESULTS: The mean age at presentation of breast cancer was 51.4 ± 10.86 years. Mean age of presentation was 53.1±11.5 and 45.7±11.9 years in never smokers and passive smokers, respectively. Age at presentation varied widely in patients exposed to tobacco smoke for >10 years in childhood from 40.3± 12.0 years to 47.7± 13.9 in patients exposed for > 20 years as adults. Among passive smokers, 60.9% were premenopausal and 39.1% of patients were postmenopausal. In never smokers, 71.4% were post menopausal. Expression of receptors in non-smokers vs passive smokers was comparable with no significant differences. Metastatic potential in lung parenchyma was slightly elevated in passive smokers as compared to never smokers although statistically non-significant.
CONCLUSIONS: An inverse relationship exists between the intensity and duration of smoking and the age at presentation and poor prognostic factors. The results strongly suggest efforts should be taken to prevent smoking, encourage quitting and restrict exposure to second hand smoke in India.","2015",,"Asian Pac J Cancer Prev"," The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of tobacco smoking in breast cancer patients in a hospital based cohort and to establish prognostic implications if any ","other","Adult, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Carcinoma, Lobular, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Carcinoma, Medullary, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasm Staging, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

STUDY TYPE: The study is a retrospective analysis of cancer mortality in NSW using NSW Central Cancer Registry data.
METHODS: Smoking-attributable cancer deaths were estimated using the smoking impact ratio method, which provides an indirect estimate of exposure to tobacco in the NSW population using lung cancer mortality. Trends in age-standardised cancer mortality rates by cancer type and the number of years of life lost due to smoking-attributable cancer deaths were estimated.
RESULTS: In NSW, the cancer mortality rate decreased in males by 26% and females by 19% between 1989 and 2008. Nearly half (44%) of the decrease for males was a result of the decline in smoking-attributable cancer deaths. Despite a decline in the female all-cancer mortality rate, the smoking-attributable cancer mortality rate increased from 20.3 per 100 000 to 26.8 per 100 000 between 1989 and 2008. Smoking-attributable cancer deaths in women increased from around 150 per year in the early 1970s to 1186 in 2008; for men, the number remained stable at just over 2000 deaths per year since the 1980s. Although the lung cancer mortality rate declined in men, lung cancer remains the largest cause of cancer death. Lung cancer has overtaken breast cancer to be the largest cause of cancer death among women, with 17.1% (n = 998) of cancer deaths due to lung cancer in 2008.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite declining all-cancer mortality in NSW, around 3330 cancer deaths in 2008 were due to the accumulated hazard of smoking in current and ex-smokers.

Tryptophan fluorescence studies, fluorescence quenching and Bis-ANS binding experiments using purified recombinant full length Pol λ and its N-terminal deletion forms have revealed UV-B induced conformational change in BRCT domain deficient Pol λ. On the other hand, the highly conserved C-terminal catalytic core PolX domain maintained its tertiary folds under similar condition. Circular dichroism (CD) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral studies have indicated appreciable change in the secondary structural elements in UV-B exposed BRCT domain deficient Pol λ. Increased thermodynamic stability of the C-terminal catalytic core domain suggested destabilizing effect of the N-terminal Ser-Pro rich region on the protein structure. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding studies have revealed increased stability of Pol λ and its N-terminal deletion mutants at high NaCl concentration. In vivo aggregation studies using transient expression systems in Arabidopsis and tobacco indicated possible aggregation of Pol λ lacking the BRCT domain. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed interaction of Pol λ with the eukaryotic molecular chaperone HSP90, suggesting the possibility of regulation of Pol λ stability by HSP90 in plant cell. Overall, our results have provided one of the first comprehensive information on the biophysical characteristics of Pol λ and indicated the importance of both BRCT and Ser-Pro rich modules in regulating the stability of this protein under genotoxic stress in plants.","2015",,"PLoS One",,"other","Arabidopsis, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Arabidopsis Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Catalytic Domain, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA Damage, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA, Plant, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Dipeptides, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Genome, Plant, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Protein Binding, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Protein Structure, Secondary, FALSE, Protein Structure, Tertiary, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Sodium Chloride, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Stress, Physiological, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Ultraviolet Rays, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

This approach has become highly successful for certain cancers. However, as the list of targeted therapies expands, their efficacy becomes more limited, and toxicity accumulates. What we have learned in the past decades is that while the targeted therapeutics approach may be highly successful in less complex tumors, cancers defined by carcinogen-induced genomic chaos, such a UV-induced melanoma or tobacco-induced lung cancer, are driven by a multitude of competing molecular pathways and, as such, are not as successfully managed by a similar approach. Luckily, in the past years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has become more fully developed with the emergence of checkpoint blockade inhibitor therapy. These promising new agents are particularly well suited for tumors with a high mutational burden due to underlying genomic disarray.

Here, we have studied the synergistic mechanism of resveratrol and curcumin induced apoptosis using in vitro (cigarette smoke condensate mediated transformed breast epithelial cell, MCF-10A-Tr) and in vivo (tumor xenograft mice) model system. Resveratrol exposure increased the intracellular uptake of curcumin in a dose dependent manner and caused apoptosis in MCF-10A-Tr cells. Approximately, ten fold lower IC50 value was noted in cells treated with the combination of resveratrol (3μM) and curcumin (3μM) in comparison to 30μM of resveratrol or curcumin alone. Resveratrol+curcumin combination caused apoptosis by increasing Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, Cytochrome C release, cleaved product of PARP and caspase 3 in cells. Interestingly, this combination unaltered the protein expressions of WNT-TCF and Notch signaling components, β-catenin and cleaved notch-1 val1744, respectively. Furthermore, the combination also significantly decreased the intermediates of Hedgehog-Gli cascade including SMO, SHH, Gli-1, c-MYC, Cyclin-D1, etc. and increased the level of p21(Waf/Cip1) in vitro and in vivo. A significant reduction of Gli- promoter activity was noted in combinational drug treated cells in comparison to individual drug treatment. Un-alteration of the expressions of the above proteins and Gli1 promoter activity in p21(Waf/Cip1) knockout cells suggests this combination caused apoptosis through p21(Waf/Cip1).

Simultaneously, the evaluation of human exposure is assessed. For many years adducts of hemoglobin (Hb) have been useful markers of the exposure of humans to various xenobiotics. These adducts are also termed biologically effective dose biomarkers. This paper focuses on a review of literature, mainly from the years 2010-2014, which refers to the hemoglobin adducts of toxic compounds with electrophilic properties. In the interactions of xenobiotics with hemoglobin, groups such as thiol, amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl of this hemoprotein are involved. These combinations occur most often in the reaction of xenobiotics with an N-terminal amino group of valine in Hb, imidazole nitrogen of histidine and cysteine sulfhydryl β93. Hb adducts are characterized by high availability, a long period of occurrence (up to 120 days) in the circulatory system, and high durability, and they have contact with all cells of the body. The measurement of hemoglobin adducts can be potentially used in the assessment of exposure to many xenobiotics such as acrylamide; substances present in tobacco smoke, e.g. benzo(α)pyrene and benzanthracene, ethylene oxide, aryl amines; and substances used on a large scale in industry such as glycidol and naphthalene and its derivatives. Recently the possibility of determination of hemoglobin adducts with estrogen metabolites has been postulated as indicators informing about heightened risk of breast cancer.

Studies have shown higher prevalence of breast cancer risk factors in more acculturated than less acculturated Hispanic/Latinas in the United States. We compared the prevalence of behavioral risk factors and family history of breast cancer by level of acculturation and country of residence in women of Mexican descent.
METHODS: Data were collected from 1,201 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients living in Mexico (n = 581) and MAs in the United States (n = 620). MA participants were categorized into three acculturation groups (Spanish dominant, bilingual, and English dominant); women living in Mexico were used as the referent group. The prevalence of behavioral risk factors and family history of breast cancer were assessed according to acculturation level, adjusting for age at diagnosis and education.
RESULTS: In the adjusted models, bilingual and English-dominant MAs were significantly more likely to have a body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or greater, consume more than one alcoholic beverage a week, and report having a family history of breast cancer than women living in Mexico.

Among the 504.6 million inhabitants of the member states of the European Union (EU28), there are annually 2.64 million new cancer cases and 1.28 million deaths from cancer. It is estimated that this cancer burden could be reduced by up to one half if scientific knowledge on causes of cancer could be translated into successful prevention. The Code is a preventive tool aimed to reduce the cancer burden by informing people how to avoid or reduce carcinogenic exposures, adopt behaviours to reduce the cancer risk, or to participate in organised intervention programmes. The Code should also form a base to guide national health policies in cancer prevention. The 12 recommendations are: not smoking or using other tobacco products; avoiding second-hand smoke; being a healthy body weight; encouraging physical activity; having a healthy diet; limiting alcohol consumption, with not drinking alcohol being better for cancer prevention; avoiding too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation; avoiding cancer-causing agents at the workplace; reducing exposure to high levels of radon; encouraging breastfeeding; limiting the use of hormone replacement therapy; participating in organised vaccination programmes against hepatitis B for newborns and human papillomavirus for girls; and participating in organised screening programmes for bowel cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.","2015",,"Cancer Epidemiol"," The Code is a preventive tool aimed to reduce the cancer burden by informing people how to avoid or reduce carcinogenic exposures , adopt behaviours to reduce the cancer risk , or to participate in organised intervention programmes ","other","European Union, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Practice Guidelines as Topic, TRUE, Quality Assurance, Health Care, FALSE, standards, Q000592, Risk Factors, FALSE, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone), a natural flavonoid found in the smoke tree (Cotinus coggygria), is known to have antimetastatic effects on prostate and lung cancers; however, the effect of fisetin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the anti-invasive activity of fisetin in human breast cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a major component facilitating the invasion of many cancer tumor cell types, and thus the inhibitory effect of fisetin on MMP-9 expression in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated human breast cancer cells was investigated in this study. Fisetin significantly attenuated TPA-induced cell invasion in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, and was found to inhibit the activation of the PKCα/ROS/ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. This effect was furthermore associated with reduced NF-κB activation, suggesting that the anti-invasive effect of fisetin on MCF-7 cells may result from inhibited TPA activation of NF-κB and reduced TPA activation of PKCα/ROS/ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signals, ultimately leading to the downregulation of MMP-9 expression.

This study aims to map out Belgian cancer mortality trends for the most common cancer types in both sexes between 1979 and 2010, and to link these with trends in cancer mortality and smoking prevalence across Europe.
METHODS: Mortality and population data were obtained from the World Health Organization Mortality Database. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated by direct standardization using the European Standard Population.
RESULTS: Belgian mortality decreased for the most common cancer sites between 1979 and 2010, except for female lung cancer. Yet, Belgian male lung and female breast cancer rates remain high compared with the remainder of Western Europe. For some cancer sites, mortality trends are similar among the European Regions (e.g. stomach cancer), yet for others trends are divergent (e.g. colorectal cancer).

METHODS: World Health Organization cancer mortality and census data were extracted to calculate death rates for 30 cancer sites from 1980 to 2010. Trends were analyzed with joinpoint regression and predicted 2015 deaths rates were computed.
RESULTS: In 2010 in Italy, there were 175,046 cancer deaths (98,847 men and 76,199 women), with total mortality rates, respectively, of 138.22 and 82.6/100,000. The leading cause of cancer death in men was lung cancer (25,457 deaths, 36.2/100,000), whereas in women it was breast cancer (12,115 deaths, 15.38/100,000). Total cancer mortality in men has been decreasing since the late 1980s, with an estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of -1.8 in 1994-2010. In women, total cancer mortality rates decreased throughout the study period, with an EAPC of -1.1 in 1992-2010. Trends in mortality were decreasing for most cancers in both sexes. Only pancreatic and lung cancer trends in women were unfavorable. Total numbers of predicted cancer deaths in Italy for 2015 increased to 102,647 men and 82,047 women; however, the predicted rates decreased in men (129.1/100,000), while remaining stable in women (82.6/100,000).
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates for the most common cancers in Italy showed favorable trends that are likely to continue in the near future, with the exception of lung cancer mortality in women.

However, a recent study in Korea showed that self-reported female smokers constituted less than half of cotinine-verified smokers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify hidden smokers using cotinine- verified method and examine cancer screening behavior according to biochemically verified smoking status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 5,584 women aged 30 years and older who participated in the Fourth and Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), 372 (6.66%) hidden smokers were identified based on interview responses and verified by urinary cotinine levels. We compared cancer-screening behavior (cervical, breast, stomach, and colon cancer) of female hidden smokers to that of non-smokers and self- reported smokers by cross-sectional analysis.
RESULTS: Hidden female smokers had significantly lower adherence to breast cancer screening compared to non-smokers (aOR (adjusted odds ratio) [95% CI] = 0.71 [0.51-0.98]). Adherence to stomach cancer (aOR [95% CI] = 0.75 [0.54-1.03]) and cervical cancer (aOR [95% CI] = 0.85 [0.66-1.10]) screening was also lower among hidden female smokers compared to non-smokers. Self-reported (current) smokers showed lowest adherence to cervical cancer (aOR: 0.64, 95% CI0.47-0.87), breast cancer (0.47 [0.32-0.68]), stomach cancer (0.66[0.46-0.95]), and colon cancer (0.62 [0.38-1.01]) screening compared to non-smokers, followed by female hidden smokers, then non-smokers. These lower adherence rates of current smokers were attenuated after we incorporated hidden smokers into the current smoker group.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer screening adherence of female hidden smokers was lower than cotinine-verified non-smokers but higher than current smokers.

Therefore, mammary nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) may become a specific target for novel anti-breast cancer therapies. Toward this goal, we investigated the difference in the ACh receptor repertoires between normal and malignant BECs, determined effects of nicotinic ligands on 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells, and characterized reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP (secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1)-1 on the expression of nAChR subunits and several oncogenes and tumor-suppressing genes in BECs. Both the non-malignant MCF10A and malignant MCF7 breast cells expressed α3, α5, α7, α9, α10, β1, β2, γ, δ and ε nAChR subunits and M(1), M(3), M(4) and M(5) muscarinic receptor subtypes. The malignancy was associated with expression of α1, α4 and β4 nAChR subunits and M(2) subtype. Malignant transformation of BECs was also associated with overexpression of α7-, and α9-made nAChRs. NNK upregulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, stimulated expression of the gene encoding the tumor-promoter HGF, downregulated expression of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, and induced tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells. Compared to the canonical nAChR antagonists, SLURP-1 showed the highest ability to abolish the nAChR-mediated effects of NNK in both cell-signaling and cell-transformation assays and reversed many effects of NNK on gene expression. SLURP-1 also markedly upregulated the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2B, RUNX3 and TP73.

RESULTS: Breast cancer was the most mentioned being as heard of (69.8%), while oral cancer was one of the least heard of (23.7%). Tobacco was identified as a risk factor by 54.8% of individuals and this knowledge was associated with their education level (P < 0.001), dentist visits (P = 0.026), and tobacco consumption (P < 0.001).

This study aimed to evaluate the association between passive smoking and breast cancer risk among Chinese women.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A hospital-based case-control study, including 877 breast cancer cases and 890 controls, frequency-matched by age and residence, was conducted. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on passive smoking history through face-to-face interview by trained interviewers. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between passive smoking and breast cancer risk. A positive association between any passive smoking exposure and breast cancer risk was observed. Compared with women who were never exposed to passive smoking, women who were ever exposed had a higher breast cancer risk, with the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.35 (1.11-1.65). Similar result was found on home passive smoking exposure and breast cancer risk, but not on workplace passive smoking exposure. Women who were ever exposed to tobacco smoke at home had a higher risk of breast cancer compared with never exposed women, with the adjusted OR (95% CI) of 1.30 (1.05-1.61). Home passive smoking exposure showed significant dose-response relationships with breast cancer risk in smoker-years, cigarettes/day and total pack-years (Ptrend=0.003, 0.006 and 0.009, respectively). An increased total smoker-years of any passive exposure significantly elevated the risk of breast cancer (Ptrend<0.001). Positive associations and dose-response relationships were found among postmenopausal women and all subtypes of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of breast cancer.

We examined whether low incidence of specific cancers is a mechanism for familial clustering of longevity.
METHODS: The study population of individuals from longevity-enriched families consisted of 3267 offspring from 610 Danish long-lived families defined by two siblings attaining an age of 90 years or more. The offspring of the long-lived siblings were followed from 1968 to 2009. Using high-quality registry data, observed numbers of cancers were compared with expected numbers based on gender-, calendar period-, and age-specific incidence rates in the general population.
RESULTS: During the 41-year-follow-up period, a total of 423 cancers occurred in 397 individuals. The standardized incidence ratios (95% confidence interval) for offspring of long-lived individuals were 0.78 (0.70-0.86) for overall cancer; 0.66 (0.56-0.77) for tobacco-related cancer; 0.34 (0.22-0.51) for lung cancer; 0.88 (0.71-1.10) for breast cancer; 0.91 (0.62-1.34) for colon cancer.

However, it is unknown whether social gradients have similar impact across race, and whether behaviors, including tobacco use, may explain a portion of the social gradient.
METHODS: We modeled relationships between area-level social class, tobacco spending and tumor characteristics, using 50,062 white and black cases diagnosed from 1992-2003 in Maryland, a racially and economically diverse state on the east coast of the United States. Multi-level models estimated the effect of area-level social class and tobacco consumption on tumor grade, size, and stage at diagnosis.
RESULTS: Adjusting for race, age and year of diagnosis, higher social class was associated with lower risk for tumors with histological grade 3 or 4 (O.R. 0.96, 95% C.I. 0.94,0.99), those diagnosed at SEER stage 2 or later (O.R. 0.89, 95% C.I. 0.86, 0.91), and tumor size >2 cm (O.R. 0.87, 95% C.I. 0.84, 0.90). Higher tobacco spending was associated with higher risk for higher grade (O.R. 1.01, 1.00, 1.03) and larger tumors (O.R. 1.03, 95% C.I. 1.01, 1.06), but was not statistically significantly related to later stage (O.R. 1.00, 95% C.I. 0.98, 1.02). Social class was less protective for black women, but tobacco effects were not race-specific.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that in one U.S. geographic area, there is a differential protection from social class for black and white women, supporting use of intersectionality theory in breast cancer disparities investigations. Area-level tobacco consumption may capture cases' direct use and second hand smoke exposure, but also may identify neighborhoods with excess cancer-related behavioral or environmental exposures, beyond those measured by social class. Given the growing global burden of both tobacco addiction and aggressive breast cancer, similar investigations across diverse geographic areas are warranted.","2015",,"Int J Health Geogr"," However , it is unknown whether social gradients have similar impact across race , and whether behaviors , including tobacco use , may explain a portion of the social gradient ","other","Adult, FALSE, Black or African American, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Maryland, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208, Middle Aged, FALSE, Social Class, TRUE, Tobacco Use, FALSE, economics, Q000191, White People, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Although cigarette smoking has been determined as a risk factor for several cancers, its role in metastasis has not been studied in detail. We propose that cigarette smoking contributes to metastatic disease via inhibition of breast cancer cell platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), resulting in PAF accumulation and a subsequent increase in cell motility. We studied several breast cell lines, including immortalized mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A), luminal A hormone positive MCF-7, basal-like triple negative MDA-MB-468, and claudin-low triple-negative highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells. We exposed cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for up to 48 h. CSE inhibited PAF-AH activity, increased PAF accumulation, and increased cell motility in MDA-MB-231 metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells. The calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) inhibitor, (S) bromoenol lactone ((S)-BEL) was used to prevent the accumulation of PAF and further prevented the increase in cell motility seen previously when cells were exposed to CSE. Thus, iPLA2 or PAF may represent a therapeutic target to manage metastatic disease, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer patients who smoke.","2015",,"Physiol Rep"," We studied several breast cell lines , including immortalized mammary epithelial cells ( MCF-10A ) , luminal A hormone positive MCF-7 , basal-like triple negative MDA-MB-468 , and claudin-low triple-negative highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"25801899","Incident cancers attributable to alcohol consumption in Germany, 2010.","Wienecke A","PURPOSE: Germany lacks an up-to-date assessment of the cancer burden attributable to alcohol. Therefore, cancer incidence attributable to this exposure was estimated for colorectal, liver, breast, and upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer. Additionally, the impact of alcohol on UADT cancer was analyzed by smoking status, to account for synergistic interactions between these two risk factors.
METHODS: Alcohol consumption and smoking prevalence from a nationwide survey in Germany 2008-2011 were combined with relative risks of incident cancer from meta-analyses to obtain population attributable risks (PARs), indicating the proportion of cancers that could be avoided by eliminating a risk factor. Each PAR was multiplied with the respective cancer incidence for 2010 to calculate the absolute number of attributable cases.
RESULTS: In Germany, for the year 2010, approximately 13,000 incident cancer cases could be attributed to alcohol consumption (3% of total cases). PAR was highest for esophageal cancer (men: 47.6% and women: 35.8%) and lowest for colorectal cancer in men (9.7%) and breast cancer in women (6.6%). Among women, moderate consumption levels account for the greatest PAR overall, whereas heavy drinking contributes considerably to overall PAR among men. Additionally, moderate-to-heavy drinking among smokers substantially contributes to the overall PAR of UADT cancers compared to drinking among non-smokers.
CONCLUSION: In Germany, a substantial proportion of cases of common cancers can be attributed to alcohol consumption, even when consumed at moderate levels. Alcohol consumption with concurrent tobacco smoking is especially important for cancers of the UADT. These findings strengthen the rationale for prevention measures that address exposure at all levels.","2015",,"Cancer Causes Control"," PURPOSE : Germany lacks an up-to-date assessment of the cancer burden attributable to alcohol ","other","Adult, FALSE, Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Colorectal Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Esophageal Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Germany, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We conducted a national survey to investigate knowledge and practices of breast cancer screening among Saudi women aged 50 years or older in order to inform the breast cancer national health programs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Saudi Health Interview Survey is a national multistage survey of individuals aged 15 years or older. The survey included questions on socio-demographic characteristics, tobacco consumption, diet, physical activity, health-care utilization, different health-related behaviors, and self-reported chronic conditions. Female respondents were asked about knowledge and practices of self and clinical breast exams, as well as mammography.
RESULTS: Between April and June 2013, a total of 10,735 participants completed the survey. Among respondents, 1,135 were women aged 50 years or older and were included in this analysis. About 89% of women reported not having a clinical breast exam in the past year, and 92% reported never having a mammogram. Women living in Al Sharqia had the highest rate of mammography use. Women who were educated, those who had received a routine medical exam within the last two years, and those who were diagnosed with hypertension were more likely to have had a mammogram in the past two years.
DISCUSSION: Our results show very low rates of breast cancer screening in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country with free health services. This calls for educational campaigns to improve breast cancer screening.

,"25740885","Prenatal smoking and age at menarche: influence of the prenatal environment on the timing of puberty.","Behie AM","STUDY QUESTION: Do prenatal exposure to cigarette smoking and birthweight influence age at menarche (AAM) in a cohort of Australian girls?
SUMMARY ANSWER: We find that prenatal smoke exposure and lower birthweight increase the chance of earlier menarche in accordance with theoretical predictions as do confounding factors of maternal AAM and higher BMI of the girls.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Much prior research focuses on the role of the early childhood environment in determining AAM but fewer studies consider the role of the prenatal environment. Those studies that examine the prenatal period find an acceleration of maturation associated with maternal smoking and low birthweight. Life history theory predicts that early life exposure to stressful environments should promote more rapid maturation and that this timing can be established before birth, making the prenatal environment particularly important.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Statistical analysis of longitudinal survey data collected from a large cohort (n = 2446) of Australian children using data from birth to 12-13 years of age.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Owing to missing data, 1493 girls were included in the final analysis. Using cox regression, we examine how (i) maternal cigarette smoking during gestation and (ii) birthweight influence girls' AAM. Cox regression was used because not all girls had reached menarche.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We find that older maternal AAM (hazards ratio (HR): 0.75, confidence interval (CI) (95%): 0.71-0.79) and higher birthweight (HR: 0.86, CI (95%): 0.75-0.97) lower the chance of earlier menarche; while higher girls' BMI at 8-9 years (HR: 1.12, CI (95%): 1.10-1.15), and maternal cigarette smoking on 'most days' during gestation (HR: 1.40, CI (95%): 1.10-1.79 with 'no smoking' as the reference level) increased the chance of earlier menarche. All factors were statistically significant at P = 0.05.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Not all girls had reached menarche, necessitating the use of cox regression. As with other longitudinal studies, there was study sample attrition and some missing data, particularly in reports of maternal smoking. In addition, as the degree of bias in the missing data is unknown, possible inaccurate reporting of maternal smoking may influence the results of birthweight on AAM.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Because of the association between younger AAM and higher risk of uterine, endometrial and breast cancer development, our finding adds to the need to consider the stress caused by prenatal smoke exposure as an important health risk. In addition, this study needs to be extended, when the same girls are 14-15 years of age, and on a larger dataset from a younger cohort within the same Australian Government project.

Periodontitis, alveolar bone loss, and tooth loss are associated with low BMD. The goal of this study is to assess the prevalence of periodontitis and perceived oral health and evaluate salivary biomarkers in postmenopausal women who are survivors of early-stage (I to IIIA) breast cancer (BCa) and receive adjuvant AI therapy.
METHODS: Participants included 58 postmenopausal women: 29 with BCa on AIs and 29 controls without BCa diagnoses. Baseline periodontal status was assessed with: 1) periodontal probing depth (PD); 2) bleeding on probing (BOP); and 3) attachment loss (AL). Demographic and dental utilization information was gathered by questionnaire. Linear regression modeling was used to analyze the outcomes.
RESULTS: No differences were found in mean PD or number of teeth. The AI group had significantly more sites with BOP (27.8 versus 16.7; P = 0.02), higher worst-site AL (5.2 versus 4.0 mm; P <0.01), and more sites with dental calculus (18.2 versus 6.4; P <0.001) than controls. Linear regression adjusted for income, tobacco use, dental insurance, and previous radiation and chemotherapy exposure demonstrated that AI use increased AL by >2 mm (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 3.92).

The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer).

METHODS: The Kailuan cohort was established on May 1, 2006. Baseline information on demography, lifestyle, medical history, and anthropometry, i.e., body height and weight, were collected during the baseline interview, and breast cancer incidence, mortality and other related outcome information were obtained by follow-up every two years and the related health condition database information were collected every year.

METHOD: We have conducted an epidemiology and functional DNA repair investigation to identify risk factors for the development of BC in Shantou, China.
RESULTS: Our survey of 372 patients and 419 matched normal controls confirmed the significant risk from many universal factors: high BMI, low education level, low fruit intake and sedate lifestyle. Significant risk factors can be organized into endogenous ones (low education and cooking with lard instead of vegetable oil) and externally-introduced ones (sedate life-style and cigarette smoking). We also found highly significant risk from passive exposure to cigarette smoke. Using the Challenge-Comet assay and blood samples from 57 patients who did not inherit the tumor suppressor BRCA gene mutations and 62 matched normal controls; we showed that reduced functional DNA repair capacity was a significant risk factor. In addition, the reduced repair capacity was associated with lymph node metastasis, and with tumors that had negative ER receptor and over-expression of Her-2.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that combined externally-introduced and endogenous life-style factors were involved with the increased incidence of BC in China. We also showed, for the first time, that inherent deficiency in DNA repair function was a significant risk factor for BC. The inherent deficiency can interact with other risk factors to significantly increase risk for BC. In addition, the reduced repair capacity was associated with certain clinical features that are indicative of poor prognosis. In this context, it is possible to integrate DNA repair capacity knowledge in promoting prevention of BC and in enhancing personalized therapeutic protocols.","2015",,"Int J Hyg Environ Health"," PURPOSE : The incidence of breast cancer ( BC ) in China has been rapidly increasing ","other","Adult, FALSE, Body Mass Index, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, China, FALSE, DNA, TRUE, DNA Repair, TRUE, Diet, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Environment, TRUE, Environmental Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Life Style, TRUE, Lymph Nodes, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Receptor, ErbB-2, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Receptors, Estrogen, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sedentary Behavior, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Specifically, smoke, polluted air, and high-temperature cooked meats comprise multiple carcinogens, such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), benzo[α]pyrene (B[α]P), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). We sought to determine if these carcinogens act together to induce breast cell carcinogenesis, and if so, whether noncytotoxic dietary agents could intervene. We demonstrated that coexposure to physiologically achievable doses of NNK, B[α]P, and PhIP (NBP) holistically enhanced initiation and progression of breast cell carcinogenesis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the ERK pathway were transiently induced by NBP in each exposure, and cross talk between reinforced ROS elevation and ERK activation played an essential role in increased DNA oxidation and damage. After cumulative exposures to NBP, this cross talk contributed to enhanced initiation of cellular carcinogenesis and led to enhanced acquisition of cancer-associated properties. Using NBP-induced transient changes, such as ROS elevation and ERK pathway activation, and cancer-associated properties as targeted endpoints, we revealed, for the first time, that two less-studied dietary compounds, ergosterol and mimosine, at physiologically achievable noncytotoxic levels, were highly effective in intervention of NBP-induced cellular carcinogenesis. Combined ergosterol and mimosine were more effective than individual agents in blocking NBP-induced transient endpoints, including ROS-mediated DNA oxidation, which accounted for their preventive ability to suppress progression of NBP-induced cellular carcinogenesis. Thus, dietary components, such as mushrooms containing ergosterol and legumes containing mimosine, should be considered for affordable prevention of sporadic breast cancer associated with long-term exposure to environmental and dietary carcinogens.","2015",,"Free Radic Biol Med"," We sought to determine if these carcinogens act together to induce breast cell carcinogenesis , and if so , whether noncytotoxic dietary agents could intervene ","other","Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Benzopyrenes, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Carcinogens, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Cell Line, FALSE, Cell Movement, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Survival, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, DNA Damage, FALSE, Ergosterol, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Female, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Imidazoles, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, MAP Kinase Signaling System, FALSE, Mammary Glands, Human, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Mimosine, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Nitrosamines, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Oxidation-Reduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Reactive Oxygen Species, FALSE, agonists, Q000819",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Although tobacco and alcohol exposures are known carcinogens, their association with male breast cancer risk remains ill-defined.
METHODS: The Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project consortium provided 2,378 cases and 51,959 controls for analysis from 10 case-control and 10 cohort studies. Individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate study design-specific (case-control/cohort) ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI), which were then combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Cigarette smoking status, smoking pack-years, duration, intensity, and age at initiation were not associated with male breast cancer risk. Relations with cigar and pipe smoking, tobacco chewing, and snuff use were also null. Recent alcohol consumption and average grams of alcohol consumed per day were also not associated with risk; only one subanalysis of very high recent alcohol consumption (>60 g/day) was tentatively associated with male breast cancer (ORunexposed referent = 1.29; 95% CI, 0.97-1.71; OR>0-<7 g/day referent = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.77). Specific alcoholic beverage types were not associated with male breast cancer. Relations were not altered when stratified by age or body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, we found little evidence that tobacco and alcohol exposures were associated with risk of male breast cancer.

METHODS: A prospective nationwide survey was conducted using a questionnaire and lexical approaches given to 2200 healthy subjects selected within a representative polling database.
RESULTS: Of the 1469 subjects eligible for full analysis, most were well informed regarding the epidemiological changes to lung cancer and the main risk factors. The overall survival of patients with lung cancer (32%) was overestimated, and the survival of patients with early stages of lung cancer was underestimated (52%). Lung cancer was identified as a severe disease (82%) with a worse prognosis than other cancers. Most of the population was aware of the main treatments available, except for targeted therapy. Using lexical analyses, we observed that a major proportion considered lung cancer to be a tobacco-induced, life-threatening disease that involved major treatment, and a minor proportion considered it to be an environmentally induced disease. Compared with breast cancer, lung cancer was characterized by a greater feeling of guilt and was more frequently associated with lifestyle.

METHODS: We analysed data from the 2011 National Rural Household Survey which was conducted among adults in five provinces and one municipality in China (N=12,397). Respondents reported their smoking status, health conditions and healthcare expenditures. Relative risks were obtained from published sources. Healthcare costs included annual outpatient and inpatient hospitalisation expenditures for five SHS-related diseases: asthma, breast cancer (female only), heart disease, lung cancer and tuberculosis. SHS-attributable healthcare costs were estimated using a prevalence-based annual cost approach.
FINDINGS: The total healthcare costs of SHS exposure in rural China amounted to $1.2 billion in 2011, including $559 million for outpatient visits and $612.4 million for inpatient hospitalisations. The healthcare costs for women and men were $877.1 million and $294.3 million, respectively. Heart disease was the most costly condition for both women ($701.7 million) and men ($180.6 million). The total healthcare costs of SHS exposure in rural China accounted to 0.3% of China's national healthcare expenditures in 2011. Over one-fifth of the total healthcare costs of SHS exposure in rural China were paid by health insurance. The out-of-pocket expenditures per person accounted for almost half (47%) of their daily income.

This association is particularly observed in women who smoke for a long duration, or who smoke for a long time prior to their first pregnancy. Here, we provide updated results on cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (NBSS). The NBSS is a large cohort of 89,835 women, aged 40-59, who were followed for a mean of 22.1 years, resulting in the ascertainment of 6,549 incident cases of breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of cigarette smoking variables with breast cancer risk. We found breast cancer to be associated with duration (40 years vs. 0: HR = 1.57; 95%CI = 1.29-1.92), intensity (40 cigarettes per day vs. 0: HR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.04-1.40), cumulative exposure (40 pack-years vs. 0: HR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.06-1.13) and latency (40 years since initiation vs. 0: HR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.10-1.53) of cigarette smoking.

METHODS: Data from 32 720 women aged 45-65 years old who participated in the 2008 to 2010 Chinese Multi-center Women Breast Cancer Screening Project, were used to analyze the prevalence rates of smoking/heavy smoking, daily smoking, smoking cessation, successful smoking cessation, passive smoking, etc.
RESULTS: A total of 913 females, accounted for 2.8% of all the women in the study, had reported the history of smoking. There were significant differences seen regarding the prevalence rates of smoking in different regions (Beijing, 2.8%; Tianjin, 5.9%; Nanchang, 1.7%; Feicheng, 0.9%; Shenyang, 1.8%). The prevalence rates of current smoking, daily smoking, and heavy smoking were 1.8%, 1.0% and 0.2%, respectively. The prevalence rates of smoking and current smoking increased with age but not the prevalence rates of daily smoking and heavy smoking. Among the smokers, the median initiation age of smoking, the median daily cigarette per day, and median year of smoking were 30 years old, 10 cigarette, and 16 years, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of targeted gender-sensitive, breast cancer-specific, Web-based messages about the increased risk of breast cancer associated with cigarette smoke exposure. Outcomes assessed 6 months postmessage delivery included nonsmoking adolescent girls' knowledge of the link between cigarette smoke exposure and breast cancer, perceptions of breast cancer risk associated with cigarette smoke, smoking behavior and intentions, and stage of change related to avoidance of secondhand smoke.
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was used to compare standard (control) messages with targeted gender- and Aboriginal status-sensitive, breast cancer-specific (intervention) messages. Messages were delivered online to 618 nonsmoking girls, aged 13 to 15 years, clustered in 74 Canadian secondary schools.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, girls in the intervention group were significantly more likely to report that breast cancer is an illness caused by cigarette smoke (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.68) and to agree that exposure to SHS increases their risk of breast cancer (ARR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.20). No significant effects were observed for a change in smoking status, intention to try smoking, or stage of change related to avoidance of SHS.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard messages, targeted gender-sensitive, breast cancer-specific messages had a stronger influence on girls' knowledge and perceived risk of cigarette smoke exposure as a risk factor for breast cancer.

One hypothesis for this increase is carcinogen exposure from tobacco. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the risk of urban female breast cancer from tobacco smoke exposure. The matched case control study was conducted among Thai females, aged 17-76 years and living in Bangkok or its surrounding areas. A total of 444 pairs of cases and controls were recruited from the Thai National Cancer Institute. Cases were newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed as breast cancer while controls were selected from healthy women who visited a patient, matched by age ± 5 years. After obtaining informed consent, tobacco smoke exposure data and information on other potential risk factors were collected by interview. The analysis was performed by conditional logistic regression, and presented with odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals(CI). From all subjects, 3.8% of cases and 3.4% of controls were active smokers while 11.0% of cases and 6.1% of controls were passive smokers. The highest to lowest sources of passive tobacco smoke were from spouses (40.8%), the workplace (36.8%) and public areas (26.3%), respectively. After adjusting for other potential risk factors or confounders, females with frequent low-dose passive smoke exposure (≤ 7 hours per week) from a spouse or workplace had adjusted odds ratio 3.77 (95%CI=1.11-12.82) and 4.02 (95%CI=1.04-15.50) higher risk of breast cancer compared with non-smokers, respectively. However, this study did not find any association of breast cancer risk in high dose passive tobacco smoke exposure, or a dose response relationship in cumulative passive tobacco smoke exposure per week, or in the active smoker group. In conclusion, passive smoke exposure may be one important risk factor of urban female breast cancer, particularly, from a spouse or workplace. This risk factor highlights the importance of avoiding tobacco smoke exposure as a key measure for breast cancer prevention and control.","2014",,"Asian Pac J Cancer Prev"," Therefore , the objective of this study was to investigate the risk of urban female breast cancer from tobacco smoke exposure ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Carcinoma, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Logistic Models, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Odds Ratio, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Thailand, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Urban Population, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We hypothesized that CYB5A and CYB5R3 polymorphisms would be associated with breast cancer risk in women.
METHODS: We characterized the prevalence of 18 CYB5A and CYB5R3 variants in genomic DNA from African American (AfrAm) and Caucasian (Cauc) women from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study population (1,946 cases and 1,747 controls) and determined their associations with breast cancer risk, with effect modification by smoking.
RESULTS: A CYB5R3 variant, I1M+6T (rs8190370), was significantly more common in breast cancer cases (MAF 0.0238) compared with controls (0.0169, p = 0.039); this was attributable to a higher MAF in AfrAm cases (0.0611) compared with AfrAm controls (0.0441, p = 0.046; adjusted OR 1.41, CI 0.98-2.04; p = 0.062). When smoking was considered, I1M+6T was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk in AfrAm smokers (adjusted OR 2.10, 1.08-4.07; p = 0.028) compared with never smokers (OR = 1.21; 0.77-1.88; p for interaction = 0.176).

We demonstrated previously that endothelial cell platelet-activating factor (PAF) production results in enhanced inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung. We propose that endothelial cell PAF accumulation plays a role in cancer cell migration to distal locations. We used cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to inhibit the activity of endothelial cell PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), which hydrolyzes and inactivates PAF, and determined whether this results in increased endothelial cell PAF accumulation and breast cancer adherence. Incubation of human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) with CSE resulted in a significant inhibition of PAF-AH activity that was accompanied by increased PAF production and adherence of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Pretreatment of HMVEC-L with (S)-bromoenol lactone to inhibit calcium-independent phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β, which initiates endothelial cell PAF production) prior to CSE exposure resulted in complete inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell adherence. Similarly, pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the PAF receptor antagonist Ginkgo biloba resulted in inhibition of adherence to the endothelium. Immunoblot analysis indicated an increase in MDA-MB-231 cell PAF receptor expression with CSE exposure. Taken together, our data indicate that CSE exposure increases endothelial cell PAF production, resulting in enhanced adherence of tumor cells to the endothelium. Our in vitro data indicate that increased tumor cell adherence would lead to enhanced metastasis formation in smokers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study explored, in 48 samples of tissue from mammary ductal carcinoma (taken from Mexican women with an average age of 58.2±10.9 years), the association of risk of metastasis with the status of hormonal receptors and the c-erbB2 protein (by immunohistochemistry) as well as clinical, histopathological and sociodemographic factors.
RESULTS: Of 48 patients, 41.6% (20/48) presented with metastasis, 43.8% were positive for the estrogen receptor (RE+), 31.3% for the progesterone receptor (RP+) and 47.7% for c-erbB2 (c-erbB2+). The following combinations were found: RE+/RP+/c-erbB2+ 8.3%, RE+/RP+ 22.9%, RE+/RP- 20.8%, RE-/RP+ 8.3%, RE-/RP-/c-erbB2- 22.9% and RE-/RP- 47.8%. There were 12 patients who used alcohol/tobacco, of which 91.6% did not present metastasis and 81.9% were RE-/RP-. Compared to the RE-/RP-/c-erbB2+, the RE+/RP+/c-erbB2+ group had a 15-fold greater risk for metastasis (95%CI, 0.9-228.8, p=0.05). The carriers of the double negative hormonal receptors had a 4.7 fold greater probability of being (or having been) smokers or drinkers (95%CI, 1.0-20.4, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a clear protective effect of using alcohol and/or tobacco, in the cases included in the present study of mammary ductal carcinoma, associated with double negative hormonal receptors.

,"25072165","Impact of smoking on estrogenic efficacy.","Ruan X","Depending on the type, duration and intensity of cigarette smoking, the efficacy of endogenous and exogenous estrogen can be reduced or completely cancelled. Not only does smoking diminish the beneficial effects of estrogen on hot flushes and urogenital symptoms and its positive effects on lipid metabolism, but smoking also can reduce estrogen's ability to prevent osteoporosis and perhaps also cardiovascular diseases. This is mainly caused by dose-dependent elevated hepatic clearance, partially in conjunction with lower estrogen levels, and has been demonstrated so far only with oral estrogen applications. Compensation for the failure of therapeutic action should not be made by increasing the dose in smokers since this might result in the production of potentially mutagenic estrogen metabolites associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Since the favorable effects of estrogens seem to be not lost in smokers when estrogens are applied transdermally, this route should be preferred in smokers. The most important conclusion from the data presented is that the effects of smoking are very complex and dependent on a multiplicity of factors, so that different types of clinically relevant negative effects must be expected.

,"25067940","Prevalence of risk factors for breast cancer in German airline cabin crew: a cross-sectional study.","Winter M","BACKGROUND: Many epidemiological studies point to an increased risk of breast cancer among female airline cabin crew. Possible causes include occupational factors (e.g. cosmic radiation exposure, chronodisruption), as well as lifestyle and reproductive factors.
AIMS: To investigate the frequency of various risk factors in German flight attendants which are recognised to be associated with breast cancer.
METHODS: 2708 current and former female cabin crew were randomly selected by a flight attendants' union and mailed a questionnaire; 1311 responded (48% response). Descriptive statistics were used to compare the distribution of breast cancer risk factors with general German population data.
RESULTS: On average, cabin crew were 3.0 cm (95% CI 2.7-3.3) taller than the comparison group, while their body mass index was 2.5 kg/m(2) (95% CI 2.4-2.6) lower. We found less use of hormone replacement therapy, but longer average use of oral contraceptives. Nulliparity among respondents aged 45+ was 57% (95% CI 54%-60%) compared to 16%. Average age at first birth was 32.1 years (95% CI 31.7-32.4) vs. 25.5 years. The birth rate was 0.62 (95% CI 0.58-0.67), less than half the population average of 1.34. Alcohol consumption was considerably higher, whereas cabin crew tended to smoke less and performed more physical exercise.
CONCLUSION: We found important differences in terms of anthropometric, gynaecological, reproductive and lifestyle factors. Some of these differences (e.g. higher nulliparity, alcohol consumption, taller size) could contribute to a higher breast cancer risk, whereas others could lead to a reduction (e.g. increased physical exercise, lower BMI, less HRT use).","2014",,"J Occup Med Toxicol"," AIMS : To investigate the frequency of various risk factors in German flight attendants which are recognised to be associated with breast cancer ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Involvement of this drug in pulmonary carcinogenesis has been poorly investigated. We used murine models suitable to evaluate cigarette smoke-related molecular and histopathological alterations. A total of 481 Swiss H mice were used. The mice were exposed to mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS) during the first four months of life. After 10 weeks, MCS caused an elevation of bulky DNA adducts, oxidative DNA damage and an extensive downregulation of microRNAs in lung. After four months, an increase in micronucleus frequency was observed in peripheral blood erythrocytes. After 7.5 months, histopathological alterations were detected in the lung, also including benign tumors and malignant tumors, and in the urinary tract. A subchronic toxicity study assessed the non-toxic doses of lapatinib, administered daily with the diet after weaning. After 10 weeks, lapatinib significantly attenuated the MCS-related nucleotide changes and upregulated several low-intensity microRNAs in lung. The drug poorly affected the MCS systemic genotoxicity and had modest protective effects on MCS-induced preneoplastic lesions in lung and kidney, when administered under conditions that temporarily mimicked interventions either in current smokers or ex-smokers. On the other hand, it caused some toxicity to the liver. Thus, on the whole, lapatinib appears to have a low impact in the smoke-related lung carcinogenesis models used, especially in terms of tumorigenic response.","2014",,"Carcinogenesis",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Antineoplastic Agents, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Body Weight, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, DNA Adducts, FALSE, DNA Damage, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Disease Models, Animal, FALSE, Erythrocytes, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Gene Expression Regulation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Lapatinib, FALSE, Lung, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Mice, FALSE, MicroRNAs, FALSE, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Quinazolines, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Toxicity Tests, Subchronic, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Genetic variation in carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes may modify these associations. Breast cancer cases were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR) during 2003-2004 and population controls through random digit dialing methods. All subjects completed self-administered questionnaires. Subsequently, saliva samples were obtained from cases (N = 1,776) and controls (N = 1,839) for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for active smoking variables, and interactions were assessed between smoking and 36 carcinogen-metabolizing candidate gene variants. No statistically significant association was found between active smoking and breast cancer risk among all women nor when stratified by menopausal status; however, nonsignificant increased premenopausal breast cancer risk was observed among current smokers and women smoking before first pregnancy. Several statistically significant interactions were observed between smoking and genetic variants (CYP1A2 1548C>T, CYP1A1 3801T>C, CYP1B1 4326G>C, NAT1 c.-85-1014T>A, UGT1A7 W208R 622T>C, SOD2 c.47T>C, GSTT1 deletion). However, in analyses stratified by these genotypes, smoking ORs had wide confidence intervals (and with few exceptions included 1.0) making interpretations difficult.

,"25017248","A multilevel model of postmenopausal breast cancer incidence.","Hiatt RA","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer has a complex etiology that includes genetic, biologic, behavioral, environmental, and social factors. Etiologic factors are frequently studied in isolation with adjustment for confounding, mediating, and moderating effects of other factors. A complex systems model approach may present a more comprehensive picture of the multifactorial etiology of breast cancer.
METHODS: We took a transdisciplinary approach with experts from relevant fields to develop a conceptual model of the etiology of postmenopausal breast cancer. The model incorporated evidence of both the strength of association and the quality of the evidence. We operationalized this conceptual model through a mathematical simulation model with a subset of variables, namely, age, race/ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first birth, age at menopause, obesity, alcohol consumption, income, tobacco use, use of hormone therapy (HT), and BRCA1/2 genotype.
RESULTS: In simulating incidence for California in 2000, the separate impact of individual variables was modest, but reduction in HT, increase in the age at menarche, and to a lesser extent reduction in excess BMI >30 kg/m(2) were more substantial.
CONCLUSIONS: Complex systems models can yield new insights on the etiologic factors involved in postmenopausal breast cancer. Modification of factors at a population level may only modestly affect risk estimates, while still having an important impact on the absolute number of women affected.
IMPACT: This novel effort highlighted the complexity of breast cancer etiology, revealed areas of challenge in the methodology of developing complex systems models, and suggested additional areas for further study.","2014",,"Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Models, Theoretical, TRUE, Postmenopause, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Identification of the phenotype-genotype relationships among miRNAs, EFs, and diseases at the network level will help us to better understand toxicology mechanisms and disease etiologies. In this study, we developed a computational systems toxicology framework to predict new associations among EFs, miRNAs and diseases by integrating EF structure similarity and disease phenotypic similarity. Specifically, three comprehensive bipartite networks: EF-miRNA, EF-disease and miRNA-disease associations, were constructed to build predictive models. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves using 10-fold cross validation ranged from 0.686 to 0.910. Furthermore, we successfully inferred novel EF-miRNA-disease networks in two case studies for breast cancer and cigarette smoke.

The new module, mainly staffed by four well-trained, volunteer undergraduates, explained the risks of first- and second-hand tobacco exposure and how to access the Helpline's services. A brochure, provided in English, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese (the Helpline's available Asian languages), was used to guide the bicultural, bilingual students' tobacco-related discussions with shoppers. The students' repeated presence at the nine partnering Asian grocery stores served as reminders of the Helpline's availability. In its first year of operation, the student trainers reached 1,052 men and 1,419 women with tobacco cessation messages. Equally important, the participating grocery stores' managers did not object to students telling their customers to quit using the tobacco products sold in their stores.

METHODS: We used a prospective cohort of 3340 postmenopausal breast cancer patients aged 50-74 and diagnosed with invasive tumours 2001-2005 in Germany, with a median follow-up time of 6 years. The effect of pre-diagnostic smoking behaviour on mortality outcomes and risk of recurrence was investigated using delayed entry Cox regression analysis. Differential effects according to N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) status, BMI, alcohol consumption, and tumour subtypes were assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, smoking at time of breast cancer diagnosis versus never/former smoking was non-significantly associated with increased breast cancer-specific mortality and risk of recurrence (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93-1.64, and HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.95-1.75, respectively). Associations were consistently stronger in NAT2 slow than in fast acetylators for all mortality outcomes. Breast cancer-specific mortality was significantly increased in smokers with NAT2 slow acetylating status (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.13-2.79) but not in those with fast acetylating status (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.60-1.98; Pheterogeneity=0.19). Smoking was associated with significantly poorer outcomes for triple negative and luminal A-like tumours (e.g. all-cause mortality: HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02-3.65, and HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.40-3.10, respectively). Risk of recurrence was significantly increased for women with HER2 positive tumours (HR 3.64, 95% CI 1.22-10.8). There was significant heterogeneity by BMI for non-breast cancer-specific mortality (<25 kg/m(2): HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.52-4.15 vs. ≥25 kg/m(2): HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.38-2.36; Pheterogeneity=0.04).
CONCLUSION: The harmful effects of smoking may be particularly relevant for certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. This may include patients with NAT2 slow acetylation status or with tumour subtypes other than luminal B, such as luminal A tumours who usually have a rather good prognosis. Emphasis on smoking cessation programmes for all cancer patients should be strengthened.","2014",,"Cancer Epidemiol",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Body Mass Index, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Germany, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasm Recurrence, Local, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Proportional Hazards Models, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, White People, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"24932579","A role for cAMP-driven transactivation of EGFR in cancer aggressiveness - therapeutic implications.","McCarty MF","In many common cancers, production of cAMP boosts cancer proliferation, survival, and aggressiveness, reflecting the fact that, through mechanisms that require further clarification, cAMP can promote tyrosine phosphorylation, notably transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Hormones which activate adenylate cyclase in many cancers include PGE2 - often produced by cox-2 activity within tumors - and adrenergic hormones, acting on beta2 receptors. NSAID cyclooxygenase inhibitors, including low-dose aspirin, clearly reduce risk for many adenocarcinomas, but the impact of cox-2 inhibitors in clinical cancer therapy remains somewhat equivocal. There is increasing evidence that increased sympathetic drive, often reflecting psychic stress or tobacco usage, increases risk for, and promotes the aggressiveness of, many cancers. The non-specific beta antagonist propranolol shows cancer-retardant activity in pre-clinical rodent studies, especially in stressed animals, and a limited amount of epidemiology concludes that concurrent propranolol usage is associated with superior prognosis in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma. Epidemiology correlating increased resting heart rate with increased total cancer mortality can be interpreted as compelling evidence that increased sympathetic drive encourages the onset and progression of common cancers. Conversely, hormones which inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in cancers may have potential for cancer control; GABA, which can be administered as a well-tolerated nutraceutical, has potential in this regard. Combination regimens intended to down-regulate cancer cAMP levels, perhaps used in conjunction with EGFR inhibitors, may have considerable potential for suppressing the contribution of cAMP/EGFR to cancer aggressiveness. This model also predicts that certain other hormones which activate adenylate cylase in various tissue may play a yet-unsuspected role in cancer induction and spread.","2014",,"Med Hypotheses",,"other","Adenylyl Cyclases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cyclic AMP, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cyclooxygenase 2, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, ErbB Receptors, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Models, Biological, TRUE, Neoplasm Invasiveness, FALSE, physiopathology, Q000503, Signal Transduction, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Sympathetic Nervous System, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Transcriptional Activation, FALSE, physiology, Q000502",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Despite this, epidemiological evidence to date is inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of active smoking and the risk of incident, invasive breast cancer using a prospective cohort of women from the Canadian Study of Diet, Lifestyle and Health.
METHODS: Using a case-cohort design, an age-stratified subcohort of 3314 women was created from 39,532 female participants who returned completed self-administered lifestyle and dietary questionnaires at baseline. A total of 1096 breast cancer cases were identified in the entire cohort (including 141 cases from the subcohort) by linkage to the Canadian Cancer Registry. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for the association between the different smoking exposures and the risk of breast cancer, using a modification for the case-cohort design.
RESULTS: After carefully considering early-life exposures and potential confounders, we found no association between any smoking exposure and risk of breast cancer in this study (Hazard ratio=1.00, 95% confidence interval=0.87-1.17 for ever vs never smokers).

However, major concerns were related to mortality patterns from other cancers, particularly in women. We provide an up-to-date picture of patterns and trends in cancer mortality in Latin America.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the World Health Organization mortality database in 2005-2009 for 20 cancer sites in 11 Latin American countries and, for comparative purposes, in the USA and Canada. We computed age-standardized (world population) rates (per 100 000 person-year) and provided an overview of trends since 1980 using joinpoint regression models.
RESULTS: Cancer mortality from some common cancers (including colorectum and lung) is still comparatively low in Latin America, and decreasing trends continue for other cancer sites (including stomach, uterus, male lung cancers) in several countries. However, there were upward trends for colorectal cancer mortality for both sexes, and for lung and breast cancer mortality in women from most countries. During the last decade, lung cancer mortality in women rose by 1%-3% per year in all Latin American countries except Mexico and Costa Rica, whereas rises of about 1% were registered for breast cancer in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Moreover, high mortality from cancer of the cervix uteri was recorded in most countries, with rates over 13/100 000 women in Cuba and Venezuela.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between PSE from partners and breast cancer risk stratified by hormone-receptor (HR) status in Chinese urban women population.
DESIGN: Hospital-based matched case control study.
SETTING: Chinese urban breast cancer patients without current or previous active smoking history in China Medical University 1st Hospital, Liaoning Province, China between Jan 2009 and Nov 2009.

Results from Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model showed that 'underweight' increased the risk on both gastric cancer incidence (adjusted HR = 3.82, 95% CI: 1.97-7.38) and liver cancer incidence (adjusted HR = 3.00, 95% CI:1.36-6.65) in males, while both 'overweight' (adjusted HR = 1.98, 95% CI:1.03-3.82) and 'obesity' (adjusted HR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.25-6.06) increased the risk of colon cancer incidence in males. But for bladder cancer incidence in males, overweight seemed being protective (adjusted HR = 0.44, 95%CI:0.23-0.84). And for lung cancer incidence in males, both overweight and obesity were protective as well (adjusted overweight vs. normal weight, HR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.46-0.76;adjusted obese vs. normal weight, HR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.44-0.92). In females, obesity increased the risk of breast cancer incidence(adjusted HR = 1.86, 95%CI:1.05-3.31). Further analysis for lung cancer cases stratified by tobacco smoking, data showed that overweight decreased the risk of lung cancer in both male non-smokers (adjusted HR = 0.50, 95%CI:0.35-0.72) and male smokers (adjusted HR = 0.70, 95%CI:0.50-0.98) while obesity decreased the risk of lung cancer in male non-smokers(adjusted HR = 0.57, 95% CI:0.33-0.97), but not in smokers (adjusted HR = 0.72, 95%CI:0.43-1.21). Stratified analysis in females by menopausal status, data showed that obesity increased the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal subjects (adjusted HR = 1.97, 95% CI:1.01-3.82), but not in premenopausal subjects.
CONCLUSION: The association between BMI and cancer incidence varied by cancer site. Underweight increased the risk of gastric cancer and liver cancer in males, and obesity increased the risk of colon cancer in males, breast cancer and ovarian cancer in females. However, overweight might played a protective role in lung cancer incidence and bladder cancer incidence in males and obesity might play a protective role in lung cancer incidence in male non-smokers.","2014",,"Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi"," OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the association and its strength between body mass index ( BMI , kg / m ( 2 ) ) and cancer incidence in a large-scale population-based cohort study ","other","Adult, FALSE, Body Mass Index, TRUE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, China, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Colonic Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Obesity, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Overweight, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Risk Factors, FALSE, Stomach Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Thinness, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Thus, we systematically searched cohort and case-control studies investigating the associations of active and passive smoking with breast cancer risk among Chinese females in four English databases (PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Wiley) and three Chinese databases (CNKI, WanFang, and VIP). Fifty-one articles (3 cohort studies and 48 case-control studies) covering 17 provinces of China were finally included in this systematic review. Among Chinese females, there was significant association between passive smoking and this risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR): 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39-1.85; I2 = 75.8%, P < 0.001; n = 26] but no significant association between active smoking and the risk of breast cancer (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.89-1.20; I2 = 13.9%, P = 0.248; n = 31). The OR of exposure to husband's smoking and to smoke in the workplace was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.07-1.50) and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.07-2.59), respectively. The OR of light and heavy passive smoking was 1.11 and 1.41, respectively, for women exposed to their husband's smoke (< 20 and ≥ 20 cigarettes per day), and 1.07 and 1.87, respectively, for those exposed to smoke in the workplace (< 300 and ≥ 300 min of exposure per day). These results imply that passive smoking is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and the risk seems to increase as the level of passive exposure to smoke increases among Chinese females.

,"24798214","Acute and chronic cadmium exposure promotes E-cadherin degradation in MCF7 breast cancer cells.","Ponce E","Cadmium is an environmental carcinogen that usually enters the body at minute concentrations through diet or cigarette smoke and bioaccumulates in soft tissues. In past studies, cadmium has been shown to contribute to the development of more aggressive cancer phenotypes including increased cell migration and invasion. This study aims to determine if cadmium exposure-both acute and chronic-contributes to breast cancer progression by interfering with the normal functional relationship between E-cadherin and β-catenin. An MCF7 breast cancer cell line (MCF7-Cd) chronically exposed to 10(-7)  M CdCl2 was previously developed and used as a model system to study chronic exposures, whereas parental MCF7 cells exposed to 10(-6)  M CdCl2 for short periods of time were used to study acute exposures. Cadmium exposure of MCF7 cells led to the degradation of the E-cadherin protein via the ubiquitination pathway. This resulted in fewer E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes and the relocation of active β-catenin to the nucleus, where it interacted with transcription factor TCF-4 to modulate gene expression. Interestingly, only cells chronically exposed to cadmium showed a significant decrease in the localization of β-catenin to the plasma membrane and an increased distance between cells. Our data suggest that cadmium exposure promotes breast cancer progression by (1) down-regulating E-cadherin, thus decreasing the number of E-cadherin/β-catenin adhesion complexes, and (2) enhancing the nuclear translocation of β-catenin to increase expression of cancer-promoting proteins (i.e., c-Jun and cyclin D1).","2015",,"Mol Carcinog"," This study aims to determine if cadmium exposure-both acute and chronic-contributes to breast cancer progression by interfering with the normal functional relationship between E-cadherin and β-catenin ","other","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cadherins, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cadmium, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Cell Nucleus, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Disease Progression, FALSE, Down-Regulation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Female, FALSE, Gene Expression, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Humans, FALSE, MCF-7 Cells, FALSE, Proteolysis, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Transcription Factor 4, FALSE, Transcription Factors, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Ubiquitination, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, beta Catenin, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Over 3,800 Israeli women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer every year and around 3400 women are diagnosed with breast carcinoma in-situ. Although smoking, either active or passive, is a controversial risk factor for breast cancer, cigarette smoking involves exposure to substrates of the NAT2 gene. The NAT2 genotype may modify the risk of cancer by activating or detoxifying heterocyclic and aromatic amines. Identification of a potential, modifiable risk factor for common and serious disease is very important for prevention and identification of high risk groups. This literature review aims to describe published studies and increase attention to measures of exposure to tobacco smoke, as well as to aspects of the NAT2 genotype that may modify the association between passive smoking and breast cancer risk. The results suggest that the NAT2 status has a differential effect on the association of active and passive smoking with breast cancer and demonstrates the need to consider possible different mechanisms associated with exposure to main and side-stream tobacco smoke.

METHODS: We examined the relation of smoking at diagnosis to breast cancer-specific and overall survival among 5,892 women with invasive breast cancer treated in one Canadian center (1987 to 2008). Women were classified as never, former or current smokers. Current smokers were further classified according to total, intensity and duration of smoking. Deaths were identified through linkage to population mortality data. Cox proportional-hazards multivariate models were used. A systematic review with meta-analysis combines new findings with published results.
RESULTS: Compared with never smokers, current smokers at diagnosis had a slightly, but not statistically significant, higher breast cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.97 to 1.37). Among current smokers, breast cancer-specific mortality increased with total exposure to, intensity and duration of smoking (all Ptrend <0.05). Compared to never smokers, breast cancer-specific mortality was 32 to 56% higher among heavy smokers (more than 30 pack years of smoking, more than 20 cigarettes per day or more than 30 years of smoking). Smoking at diagnosis was associated with an increased all-cause mortality rate. A meta-analysis of all studies showed a statistically significant, 33% increased mortality from breast cancer in women with breast cancer who are smokers at diagnosis compared to never smokers (hazard ratio = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.58).
CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence to date indicates that smoking at diagnosis is associated with a reduction of both overall and breast cancer-specific survival.

Decellularized human skin has been used in a variety of medical applications, primarily involving soft tissue reconstruction, wound healing, and tendon augmentation. Theoretically, decellularization removes potentially immunogenic material and provides a clean scaffold for cellular and vascular in growth. The use of acellular dermal matrix in two-stage postmastectomy breast reconstruction is described. Methods. Ten consecutive breast cancer patients were treated with mastectomies and immediate reconstruction from August to November 2011. There were 8 bilateral and 1 unilateral mastectomies for a total of 17 breasts, with one exclusion for chronic tobacco use. Reconstruction included the use of a new 6 × 16 cm sterile, room temperature acellular dermal matrix patch (DermACELL) soaked in a cefazolin bath. Results. Of the 17 breasts, 15 reconstructions were completed; 14 of them with expander to implant sequence and acellular dermal matrix. Histological analysis of biopsies obtained during trimming of the matrix at the second stage appeared nonremarkable with evidence of normal healing, cellularity, and vascular infiltration. Conclusion. Postoperative observations showed that this cellular dermal matrix appears to be an appropriate adjunct to reconstruction with expanders.

The overview of all trials gives an estimation of 20 % for the breast cancer mortality reduction in the population invited to screening and of 30 % in the population effectively screened. Estimating overdiagnosis is more difficult and many estimations are biased for want of a proper adjustment to correct for systematic differences between the compared populations. None of the correctly adjusted estimations are above 10 %. Breast cancer screening is more beneficial than detrimental, but the benefit is not large.

Here, we show that nicotine induces the expression of galectin-3 (an anti-apoptotic β-galactoside-binding lectin) in breast cancer cell line and in primary tumors from breast cancer patients. Nicotine-induced up regulation of galectin-3 is due to an increased expression of α9 isoform of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α9nAChR), which activates transcription factor STAT3 that in turn, physically binds to galectin-3 (LGALS3) promoter and induces transcription of galectin-3. Intracellular galectin-3 increased mitochondrial integrity and suppressed chemotherapeutic-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cell. Moreover, nicotine-induced enrichment of side population cells with cancer stem cell-like properties was modulated by galectin-3 expression and could be significantly reduced by transient knock down of LGALS3 and its upstream signaling molecules STAT3 and α9nAChR. Thus, galectin-3 or its upstream signaling molecule STAT3 or α9nAChR could be a potential target to prevent nicotine-induced chemoresistance in breast cancer.","2014",,"Breast Cancer Res Treat",,"other","Apoptosis, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Blotting, Western, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, FALSE, DNA Fragmentation, FALSE, Galectin 3, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Humans, FALSE, Immunohistochemistry, FALSE, Neoplastic Stem Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Nicotine, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Nicotinic Agonists, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, FALSE, Receptors, Nicotinic, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, STAT3 Transcription Factor, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Side-Population Cells, FALSE, Signal Transduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Transfection, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Low activity predicted increased breast cancer risk only among women assigned to placebo (P = 0.021 activity main effect, P = 0.013 activity-treatment interaction; HR = 1.4 for the placebo group) and endometrial cancer among all women (P = 0.026, HR = 1.7). Moderate alcohol (>0-1 drink/day) was associated with decreased risk of colon cancer (P = 0.019; HR = 0.35) versus no alcohol. There were no other significant associations between these behaviors and cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Among women with elevated risk of breast cancer, smoking has an even greater impact on breast cancer risk than observed in past studies in the general population.

However, results from previous studies have been inconsistent. This case-control study investigated the association of cigarette smoking with breast cancer risk in terms of estrogen-receptor/progesterone-receptor (ER/PgR) status. From among female patients aged 30 years and over admitted to a single hospital in Japan between 1997 and 2011, 1,263 breast cancer cases (672 ER+/PgR+, 158 ER+/PgR-, 22 ER-/PgR+, 308 ER-/PgR- and 103 missing) and 3,160 controls were selected. History of smoking (ever, never), some smoking-related measures, and passive smoking from husbands (ever, never) were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Polytomous logistic regression and tests for heterogeneity across ER+/PgR + and ER-/PgR- were conducted. For any hormone receptor subtype, no significant association was observed between history of smoking (ever, never) and breast cancer risk. Analysis of smoking-related measures revealed that starting to smoke at an early age of ≤19 years was significantly associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal ER-/PgR- cancer (odds ratio = 7.01, 95% confidence interval: 2.07-23.73). Other measures of smoking such as the number of cigarettes per day, the duration of smoking, and start of smoking before the first birth were not associated with breast cancer risk for any receptor subtype. There was no association between passive smoking (ever, never) and breast cancer risk for any of the four subtypes. These results indicate that history of smoking and passive smoking from husbands may have no overall effect on breast cancer risk for any hormone receptor subtype. However, it is possible that women who start to smoke as teenagers may have a higher risk of developing postmenopausal ER-/PgR- cancer. Further studies are needed to clarify the association of smoking with breast cancer risk, especially the role of starting to smoke at an early age.","2014",,"Springerplus",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"24515648","Active smoking and the risk of estrogen receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancer among women ages 20 to 44 years.","Kawai M","BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the correlation between smoking and breast cancer among young women is mixed, and previous studies have not assessed whether smoking is associated differentially with risks of the major breast cancer subtypes.
METHODS: This was a population-based, case-control study of 778 women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers and 182 women with ER-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (triple-negative [TN]), invasive breast cancers ages 20 to 44 years who were diagnosed from 2004 to 2010 in the Seattle-Puget Sound metropolitan area. A control group of 938 cancer-free women also was included. Associations between various aspects of smoking history and the risks of ER-positive and TN breast cancer were assessed using polytomous logistic regression.
RESULTS: Ever-smokers had a 1.3-fold increased risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-fold to 1.7-fold increased risk) of breast cancer overall; and, when stratified by cancer subtype, they had a 1.4-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.1-fold to 1.8-fold increased risk) of ER-positive breast cancer, but there was no elevation in their risk of TN disease (odds ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.6). Current/recent smokers with a ≥10 pack-year history of smoking had a 1.6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.1-fold to 2.4-fold increased risk) of ER-positive breast cancer but had no increase in their risk of TN breast cancer (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-1.9).
CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that young women who are current/recent smokers with high pack-year histories may have an increased risk of ER-positive breast cancer but not TN breast cancer. Although this association was modest, the findings suggest that an increased risk of ER-positive breast cancer may be another health risk incurred by young women who smoke.","2014",,"Cancer",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Receptors, Estrogen, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Risk Factors, FALSE, SEER Program, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Washington, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Moreover, data on dietary carotenoids in relation to breast cancer in non-Western populations are scarce. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between dietary carotenoid intake and the risk of breast cancer among Chinese women. A total of 561 cases and 561 controls who were frequency matched by age (5-year interval) and residence were recruited in the present case-control study. Dietary intake information was collected by a face-to-face interview using a validated FFQ. The OR and 95 % CI were assessed by multivariate logistic regression after adjusting for various potential confounders. An inverse association was observed between the consumption of α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and lutein/zeaxanthin and the risk of breast cancer. The multivariate-adjusted OR for the highest quartile of intake compared with the lowest quartile of intake were 0·61 (95 % CI 0·43, 0·88) for α-carotene, 0·54 (95 % CI 0·38, 0·78) for β-carotene, 0·38 (95 % CI 0·26, 0·52) for β-cryptoxanthin and 0·49 (95 % CI 0·34, 0·71) for lutein/zeaxanthin. Lycopene intake was not found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer, with the adjusted OR of 0·89 (95 % CI 0·61, 1·30). These inverse associations were more evident among pre-menopausal women and women who were exposed to second-hand smoke.

Resveratrol (Res) is a promising natural chemotherapeutic agent that regulates many cellular targets including p21, a cip/kip family of cyclin kinase inhibitors involved in DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and blocking of DNA replication and repair. We have recently shown that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) prepared from commercially available Indian cigarette can cause neoplastic transformation of normal breast epithelial MCF-10A cell. Here we studied the mechanism of Res mediated apoptosis in CSC transformed (MCF-10A-Tr) cells in vitro and in vivo. Res mediated apoptosis in MCF-10A-Tr cells was a p21 dependent event. It increased the p21 protein expression in MCF-10A-Tr cells and MCF-10A-Tr cells-mediated tumors in xenograft mice. Res treatment reduced the tumor size(s) and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. PI3K, AKT, NFκB) in solid tumor. The expressions of cell cycle regulatory (Cyclins, CDC-2, CDC-6, etc.), BER associated (Pol-β, Pol-δ, Pol-ε, Pol-η, RPA, Fen-1, DNA-Ligase-I, etc.) proteins and LP-BER activity decreased in MCF-10A-Tr cells but remain significantly unaltered in isogenic p21 null MCF-10A-Tr cells after Res treatment. Interestingly, no significant changes were noted in SP-BER activity in both the cell lines after Res exposure. Finally, it was observed that increased p21 blocks the LP-BER in MCF-10A-Tr cells by increasing its interaction with PCNA via competing with Fen-1 after Res treatment. Thus, Res caused apoptosis in CSC-induced cancer cells by reduction of LP-BER activity and this phenomenon largely depends on p21.","2014",,"Toxicol Appl Pharmacol"," Here we studied the mechanism of Res mediated apoptosis in CSC transformed ( MCF-10A-Tr ) cells in vitro and in vivo ","other","Animals, FALSE, Antineoplastic Agents, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Apoptosis, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Cell Cycle, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Death, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Line, Transformed, FALSE, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA Damage, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, DNA Repair, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, FALSE, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Female, FALSE, Flap Endonucleases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Mammary Glands, Human, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred BALB C, FALSE, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, RNA Interference, FALSE, Resveratrol, FALSE, Signal Transduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Smoke, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Stilbenes, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Time Factors, FALSE, Transfection, FALSE, Up-Regulation, FALSE, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

As an overview, lung cancer and mouth-oropharynx cancer rank as the top two prevalent cancers in males. Other types of cancers are esophagus cancer and stomach cancer. In women, cancer cervix uteri and breast cancer are most prevalent. Other cancer types, which affect women, are mouth and oropharynx cancer, lung cancer, and esophagus cancer. There are around 150 qualified clinical oncologists and 16 pediatric oncologists working in the different parts of the country. Regular cancer treatment is available in 19 hospitals and 465 hospital beds are attached as indoor or day care facilities for chemotherapy in the oncology/radiotherapy departments. There are about 15 linear accelerators, 12 Co-60 teletherapy and 12 brachytherapy units currently available. Approximately, 56 cancer chemotherapeutic agents are obtainable in Bangladesh. Research facilities are available at tertiary care centers and a few multi country collaborative research activities are ongoing. Bangladesh has a unique National Cancer Control Strategy and Plan of Action 2009-2015 formulated with the assistance of WHO with an objective to develop and implement continuum of cancer care through a comprehensive cancer control programe. Preventive measures taken to reduce the incidence of cancer include reduced tobacco smoking, change of dietary habit and reduced food adulteration, ensuring reproductive hygiene, increased physical activity, and reduced occupational hazard. Awareness buildup and media campaign are going on by organizing the general people, opinion leaders of the society, and boy and girl scout.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the initial reactions of girls and boys to tailored Web-based messages that describe the relationship between SHS and BC, using a parallel, single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: This trial was nested within a cycle of an ongoing longitudinal study of 1498 students from 74 secondary schools. Self-reported assessments were used to evaluate the impact of study messages on participants' risk perception and interest in obtaining additional information after participants were randomized by schools to control or intervention groups. The intervention group received a tailored visual message (based on gender and Aboriginal status) about BC and tobacco smoke. The control group received a standard visual message about smoking and cancer.
RESULTS: SHS exposure was identified as a BC risk factor by 380/1488 (25.54%) participants, during the preintervention analysis. Compared to the female participants in the control group (491/839, 58.5%), girls who received the intervention (339/649, 52.2%) were 14% more likely to agree that exposure to SHS increased their BC risk (relative risk [RR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.21). Nonsmoking girls who received the intervention were 14% more likely to agree that starting smoking would increase their BC risk (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.21).

PURPOSE: The newest studies explain these differences by the genetic polymorphism. Cigarette smoke contains at least 20 chemical carcinogens, which are deposited and metabolically activated in the breast and surrounding adipose tissues. The substances are further detected in the nipple discharge or as smoking  specific DNA adducts in breast tissue. Several studies postulate significantly higher risk of breast cancer among women who started smoking at an early age and/ or before their first delivery. Some studies from Japan, China, California have shown that longterm exposure to passive smoking could significantly increase the risk of breast cancer in never smokers, while other scientist reject the evidence of this association as inconsistent. A possible protective effect of smoking on the incidence of breast cancer is explained by antiestrogenic activity of smoking, namely nicotine.
CONCLUSION: Smoking may play a role in the breast cancer incidence. Due to a wide spectrum of harmful effects of smoking, and with regards to the worse prognosis of breast cancer among smoking patients, the common recommendations for cancer prevention are similarly plausible in case of breast cancer - no  smoking, no alcohol, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity and body weight control.","2013",,"Klin Onkol"," PURPOSE : The newest studies explain these differences by the genetic polymorphism "," review","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Based on this system, breast cancer is broadly divided into the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the non-TNBC subtypes. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer, notable for its propensity to metastasize early and display a comparatively more aggressive course than its non-TNBC counterpart. Certain clinico-pathologic and demographic risk factors have been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we aim to compare mean age, ethnicity, family history, tobacco use and stage at presentation between TNBC and non-TNBC subtypes at our inner city university program.
METHODS: We reviewed data in our tumor registry between January 2000 and December 2005 with particular attention to mean age, race, family history, tobacco use and stage at presentation. We found a total of 445 patients with various subtypes of breast cancers. We included only those patients in whom the status of both ER/PR and the status of Her2/neu protein overexpression were recorded. Our strict selection criteria lead to an exclusion of about 103 patients. Out of the remaining 342 patients, 39 were TNBC and 303 were non-TNBC.
RESULTS: Mean age of onset for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients was 59.87 ± 15.67 years vs. 60.09 ± 13.98 years respectively (P = 0.9272). In terms of ethnicity, TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients had the following racial backgrounds: black, 58.97% vs. 39.27%; white, 35.90% vs. 57.76%; Chinese, 2.56% vs. 0.99%; others, 2.57% vs. 1.98% respectively (P = 0.004, OR = 2.755). Comparisons with respect to a history of tobacco abuse for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients revealed a positive smoking history in 20.51% vs. 27.72% whereas there was no former or current smoking history in 71.79% vs. 61.72% respectively (P = 0.4385). Comparison of family history of a breast cancer in TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients showed that positive family history of breast cancer was seen in 30.77% vs. 33.33%, no family history of cancer was seen in 51.28% vs. 51.82% and unknown 17.95% vs. 14.85% (P = 0.8384). Pathologic stage at the time of diagnosis for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients was as follows: stage 0, 15.79% vs. 11.37% (P = 0.4332); stage 1, 34.21% vs. 30.98% (P = 0.6890); stage 2, 28.98% vs. 37.25% (P = 0.3205); stage 3, 18.42% vs. 17.25% (P = 0.0.8591); and stage 4, 3.63% vs. 3.14% (P = 0.8651).

This research reflects a convergence of epidemiologic, clinical, and preclinical evidence, suggesting that metformin may lower cancer risk in diabetics and improve outcomes of many common cancers. Notably, metformin mediates an approximately 30 % reduction in the lifetime risk of cancer in diabetic patients. There is growing recognition that metformin may act (1) directly on cancer cells, primarily by impacting mitochondrial respiration leading to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which controls energy homeostasis in cells, but also through other mechanisms or (2) indirectly on the host metabolism, largely through AMPK-mediated reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis, leading to reduced circulating insulin levels and decreased insulin/IGF-1 receptor-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway. Support for this comes from the observation that metformin inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and delays the onset of tobacco carcinogen-induced lung cancer in mice and that metformin and its analog phenformin delay spontaneous tumor development cancer-prone transgenic mice. The potential for both direct antitumor effects and indirect host-mediated effects has sparked enormous interest, but has led to added challenges in translating preclinical findings to the clinical setting. Nonetheless, the accumulation of evidence has been sufficient to justify initiation of clinical trials of metformin as an anticancer agent in the clinical setting, including a large-scale adjuvant study in breast cancer, with additional studies planned.","2014",,"Cancer Treat Res",," review","Animals, FALSE, Antineoplastic Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Humans, FALSE, Hypoglycemic Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Metformin, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Mice, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"24099783","The contribution of heavy metals in cigarette smoke condensate to malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells and in vivo initiation of neoplasia through induction of a PI3K-AKT-NFκB cascade.","Mohapatra P","Cigarette smoking is a crucial factor in the development and progression of multiple cancers including breast. Here, we report that repeated exposure to a fixed, low dose of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) prepared from Indian cigarettes is capable of transforming normal breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A, and delineate the biochemical basis for cellular transformation. CSC transformed cells (MCF-10A-Tr) were capable of anchorage-independent growth, and their anchorage dependent growth and colony forming ability were higher compared to the non-transformed MCF-10A cells. Increased expression of biomarkers representative of oncogenic transformation (NRP-1, Nectin-4), and anti-apoptotic markers (PI3K, AKT, NFκB) were also noted in the MCF-10A-Tr cells. Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling of MCF-10A and MCF-10A-Tr cells revealed that transformed cells acquired allelic variation during transformation, and had become genetically distinct. MCF-10A-Tr cells formed solid tumors when implanted into the mammary fat pads of Balb/c mice. Data revealed that CSC contained approximately 1.011μg Cd per cigarette equivalent, and Cd (0.0003μg Cd/1×10(7) cells) was also detected in the lysates from MCF-10A cells treated with 25μg/mL CSC. In similar manner to CSC, CdCl2 treatment in MCF-10A cells caused anchorage independent colony growth, higher expression of oncogenic proteins and increased PI3K-AKT-NFκB protein expression. An increase in the expression of PI3K-AKT-NFκB was also noted in the mice xenografts. Interestingly, it was noted that CSC and CdCl2 treatment in MCF-10A cells increased ROS. Collectively, results suggest that heavy metals present in cigarettes of Indian origin may substantially contribute to tumorigenesis by inducing intercellular ROS accumulation and increased expression of PI3K, AKT and NFκB proteins.","2014",,"Toxicol Appl Pharmacol",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Breast, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cell Line, Transformed, FALSE, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, FALSE, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Metals, Heavy, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred BALB C, FALSE, NF-kappa B, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Smoke, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"23919753","Cigarette smoke induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition and increases the metastatic ability of breast cancer cells.","Di Cello F","BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate that both active and involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke increase the risk of breast cancer. Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms by which continuous, long term exposure to tobacco smoke contributes to breast carcinogenesis because most previous studies have focused on short term treatment models. In this work we have set out to investigate the progressive transforming effects of tobacco smoke on non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells using in vitro and in vivo models of chronic cigarette smoke exposure.
RESULTS: We show that both non-tumorigenic (MCF 10A, MCF-12A) and tumorigenic (MCF7) breast epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke acquire mesenchymal properties such as fibroblastoid morphology, increased anchorage-independent growth, and increased motility and invasiveness. Moreover, transplantation experiments in mice demonstrate that treatment with cigarette smoke extract renders MCF 10A cells more capable to survive and colonize the mammary ducts and MCF7 cells more prone to metastasize from a subcutaneous injection site, independent of cigarette smoke effects on the host and stromal environment. The extent of transformation and the resulting phenotype thus appear to be associated with the differentiation state of the cells at the time of exposure. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that treatment with CSE leads to the emergence of a CD44(hi)/CD24(low) population in MCF 10A cells and of CD44+ and CD49f + MCF7 cells, indicating that cigarette smoke causes the emergence of cell populations bearing markers of self-renewing stem-like cells. The phenotypical alterations induced by cigarette smoke are accompanied by numerous changes in gene expression that are associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and tumorigenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that exposure to cigarette smoke leads to a more aggressive and transformed phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells and that the differentiation state of the cell at the time of exposure may be an important determinant in the phenotype of the final transformed state.","2013",,"Mol Cancer"," Little is known , however , about the molecular mechanisms by which continuous , long term exposure to tobacco smoke contributes to breast carcinogenesis because most previous studies have focused on short term treatment models ","other","Animals, FALSE, Breast, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Cell Movement, FALSE, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, TRUE, genetics, Q000235, Female, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, MCF-7 Cells, FALSE, Mice, FALSE, Neoplasm Invasiveness, FALSE, Neoplasm Metastasis, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Stem Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

To explore this hypothesis, we examined the association between disulfiram use and these cancers in a nationwide register-based case-control study nested within ever-users (≥one prescription) of disulfiram. Cases were all Danish individuals with a histologically verified first-time diagnosis of malignant melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer during 2000-2009. For each case, we selected four cancer-free controls matched for age, sex, and year of first disulfiram prescription using risk set sampling. Similarly, for secondary analyses, we selected case-control populations for selected tobacco-related and alcohol-related cancer types, that is, cancers of the buccal cavity, liver, lung, and colorectal cancer. Disulfiram use 1 year before cancer diagnosis and the corresponding date for controls were disregarded. We estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer associated with long-term (≥500 daily defined doses) versus one-time (one prescription) use of disulfiram. Among 53 856 disulfiram users, we identified 166, 644, and 464 cases, respectively, of melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer. Adjusted odds ratios for melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer associated with long-term disulfiram use were 1.04 (95% CI: 0.60-1.78), 0.92 (95% CI: 0.70-1.22), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.56-1.06), respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 321 women, data were collected by Questionnaire, Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Form and Champion's Health Belief Model Scale. Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi- squared tests and logistic regression were used in the statistical analysis.
RESULTS: It was found that only 2.2% of women have high and very high risk levels of breast cancer risk. There is a positive correlation between early diagnosis techniques and Health Belief Model Sub-Dimension scores which are sensibility, health motivation, BSE (Breast self-examination) self-efficient perception and negative correlation between mammography barrier score and BSE barrier score (p 0.05). When factors for not having BSE were examined, it was determined that the women who do not have information about breast cancer and the women who smoke have a higher risk of not having BSE.

METHODS/PATIENTS: Data have been provided by two population-based cancer registries, Girona and Tarragona, and the Catalan mortality registry. Cancer incidence in Catalonia has been estimated through modeling methods using data from these health structures.
RESULTS: During 2003-2007, there were 20,042 cancer cases and 9,842 deaths per year among men and 13,673 new cancer cases and 5,882 deaths among women. The most frequent incident cancers among men were prostate (N = 4,258), lung (N = 3,021), colorectal (N = 3,007) and bladder (N = 2,238), whereas among women they were breast (N = 3,907), colorectal (N = 2,088), corpus uteri (N = 734) and lung (N = 527). During 1993-2007, age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) rose 1.2 % per year among men [prostate (6.3 %), testis (5.7 %), kidney (2.9 %), liver (2.2 %) and colorectal (2.1 %)]. ASIRs decreased for stomach (-2.9 %), oral cavity and pharynx (-2.8 %), larynx (-2.7 %) and esophagus (-2 %). Among women, ASIRs only rose for lung (5.2 %), kidney (3.1 %), oral cavity and pharynx (2.6 %) and thyroid (1.6 %). ASIRs decreased for corpus uteri (-2.3 %), stomach (-1.7 %) and ovary (-1.6 %). Cancer mortality decreased -1.3 % per year among men and -2.1 % among women during the same period.
CONCLUSION: Among men, the decrease of incidence/mortality of tobacco-related tumors was related to a reduction of smoking prevalence. Among women, the stabilization of breast cancer incidence and the rise of lung cancer incidence are similar to that observed in most European regions. These results allow assessing the effectiveness of public health strategies and they pose new frontiers for cancer control in Catalonia.","2014",,"Clin Transl Oncol"," PURPOSE : To describe time trends of cancer in Catalonia , Spain , during the period 1993-2007 ","other","Age Distribution, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Registries, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Spain, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Time Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Its deduced amino acid sequence showed about 40% identity with the PESCADILLO protein of zebrafish and humans. Primary structure analysis of the protein revealed a Pescadillo N-terminus domain, a single breast cancer C-terminal domain, two nuclear localization signals, and a potential coiled-coil region as also found in animal PESCADILLO proteins. Therefore, we designated this gene DcPES1. Although DcPES1 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined, its levels were highest in tissues with proliferating cells. Immunofluorescence using specific antiserum against the recombinant protein revealed that DcPES1 localized exclusively in the nucleolus. Examination of fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein revealed that the N-terminal portion was important for localization to the nucleoli of tobacco and onion cells. Moreover, when the nuclear matrix of carrot cells was immunostained with an anti-DcPES1 serum, the signal was detected in the nucleolus.

,"23668584","UK health performance: findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.","Murray CJ","BACKGROUND: The UK has had universal free health care and public health programmes for more than six decades. Several policy initiatives and structural reforms of the health system have been undertaken. Health expenditure has increased substantially since 1990, albeit from relatively low levels compared with other countries. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to examine the patterns of health loss in the UK, the leading preventable risks that explain some of these patterns, and how UK outcomes compare with a set of comparable countries in the European Union and elsewhere in 1990 and 2010.
METHODS: We used results of GBD 2010 for 1990 and 2010 for the UK and 18 other comparator nations (the original 15 members of the European Union, Australia, Canada, Norway, and the USA; henceforth EU15+). We present analyses of trends and relative performance for mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We present results for 259 diseases and injuries and for 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors relevant to the UK. We assessed the UK's rank for age-standardised YLLs and DALYs for their leading causes compared with EU15+ in 1990 and 2010. We estimated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all measures.
FINDINGS: For both mortality and disability, overall health has improved substantially in absolute terms in the UK from 1990 to 2010. Life expectancy in the UK increased by 4·2 years (95% UI 4·2-4·3) from 1990 to 2010. However, the UK performed significantly worse than the EU15+ for age-standardised death rates, age-standardised YLL rates, and life expectancy in 1990, and its relative position had worsened by 2010. Although in most age groups, there have been reductions in age-specific mortality, for men aged 30-34 years, mortality rates have hardly changed (reduction of 3·7%, 95% UI 2·7-4·9). In terms of premature mortality, worsening ranks are most notable for men and women aged 20-54 years. For all age groups, the contributions of Alzheimer's disease (increase of 137%, 16-277), cirrhosis (65%, ?15 to 107), and drug use disorders (577%, 71-942) to premature mortality rose from 1990 to 2010. In 2010, compared with EU15+, the UK had significantly lower rates of age-standardised YLLs for road injury, diabetes, liver cancer, and chronic kidney disease, but significantly greater rates for ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, breast cancer, other cardiovascular and circulatory disorders, oesophageal cancer, preterm birth complications, congenital anomalies, and aortic aneurysm. Because YLDs per person by age and sex have not changed substantially from 1990 to 2010 but age-specific mortality has been falling, the importance of chronic disability is rising. The major causes of YLDs in 2010 were mental and behavioural disorders (including substance abuse; 21·5% [95 UI 17·2-26·3] of YLDs), and musculoskeletal disorders (30·5% [25·5-35·7]). The leading risk factor in the UK was tobacco (11·8% [10·5-13·3] of DALYs), followed by increased blood pressure (9·0 % [7·5-10·5]), and high body-mass index (8·6% [7·4-9·8]). Diet and physical inactivity accounted for 14·3% (95% UI 12·8-15·9) of UK DALYs in 2010.
INTERPRETATION: The performance of the UK in terms of premature mortality is persistently and significantly below the mean of EU15+ and requires additional concerted action. Further progress in premature mortality from several major causes, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers, will probably require improved public health, prevention, early intervention, and treatment activities. The growing burden of disability, particularly from mental disorders, substance use, musculoskeletal disorders, and falls deserves an integrated and strategic response.

In addition, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most well-known genetic factors that increase risk for breast cancer. Coincidence of those environmental and genetic factors might augment the risk of tumorigenesis of breast. To verify this hypothesis, we briefly evaluated the carcinogenic potency of various environmental factors in the absence or presence of BRCA1 as a genetic factor in a normal mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A. Many environmental factors tested increased cellular ROS level in the absence of other insult. In addition, TCDD, DMBA, 3MC, and BPA enhanced the BaP-induced ROS production. BRCA1 knockdown (BRCA1-KD) cells by siRNA significantly induced cellular accumulation of ROS compared to control cells. In this setting, the addition of paraquat, TCDD, DMBA, 2OHE2 or 4OHE2 significantly augmented ROS generation in BRCA1-KD MCF10A cells. Measurements of BaP-DNA adduct formation as a marker of DNA damage also revealed that BRCA1 deficiency leads increased DNA damage. In addition, TCDD and DMBA significantly increased BaP-DNA adduct formation in the absence of BRCA1. These results imply that elevated level of ROS is correlated with increase of DNA damage in BRCA1 defective cells. Taken together, our study suggests that several environmental factors might increase the risk of tumorigenesis in BRCA1 defective breast epithelial cells.","2013",,"J Toxicol Sci",,"other","BRCA1 Protein, FALSE, deficiency, Q000172, Breast, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Cell Line, FALSE, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, DNA Damage, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Environmental Pollutants, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Reactive Oxygen Species, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of smoking behaviours on the risk of breast cancer among three ethnic groups of New Zealand women.
METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted including breast cancer cases registered on the New Zealand Cancer Registry between 2005 and 2007. Controls were matched by ethnicity and 5-year age-group. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between breast cancer and smoking at different time points across the lifecourse, for each ethnic group. Estimated odds ratios (OR) were adjusted for established risk factors.
RESULTS: The study comprised 1,799 cases (302 Māori, 70 Pacific, 1,427 non-Māori/non-Pacific) and 2,540 controls (746 Māori, 191 Pacific, 1,603 non-Māori/non-Pacific). There was no clear association between smoking and breast cancer for non-Māori/non-Pacific women, although non-Māori/non-Pacific ex-smokers had statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer when smoking duration was 20 years or more, and this remained significant in the fully adjusted model (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.66). Māori showed more consistent increased risk of breast cancer with increasing duration among current smokers (<20 years OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.74; 20+ years OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.22). There was a clear pattern of shorter duration since smoking cessation being associated with increased likelihood of breast cancer, and this was apparent for all ethnic groups.
CONCLUSION: There was no clear pattern for cigarette smoking and breast cancer incidence in non-Māori/non-Pacific women, but increased risks were observed for Māori and Pacific women. These findings suggest that lowering the prevalence of smoking, especially among Māori and Pacific women, could be important for reducing breast cancer incidence.","2013",,"PLoS One"," The aim of this study was to assess the effect of smoking behaviours on the risk of breast cancer among three ethnic groups of New Zealand women ","other","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, New Zealand, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Risk, FALSE, Smoking, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Since some new cohort studies have suggested that this risk is confined to women who started to smoke before first childbirth, we wanted to examine the association between smoking and breast cancer, with a focus on time of smoking initiation in relation to the first childbirth.
METHODS: We followed 302,865 Norwegian women born between 1899 and 1975, recruited from 1974 to 2003, by linkage to national registries through December 2007. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: During more than 4.1 million person-years of follow-up, we ascertained 7,490 cases of primary invasive breast cancer. Compared with never smokers, ever smokers had a 15% (HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.21) increased risk of breast cancer overall and also a significantly increased risk of breast cancer in the three most exposed categories of age at smoking initiation (parous women), number of cigarettes smoked per day, years of smoking duration and number of pack-years. Ever smokers who started to smoke more than 1 year after the first childbirth had not an increased risk (HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.86-1.02), while those who initiated smoking more than 10 years before their first childbirth had a 60% (HR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.42-1.80) increased risk of breast cancer, compared with never smokers.

,"23613808","The absence of mrp4 has no effect on the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils into the lung after LPS, cigarette smoke or allergen challenge.","Schymeinsky J","The multidrug resistance protein 4 (Mrp4) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that is capable of exporting the second messenger cAMP from cells, a process that might regulate cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory processes. However, using LPS- or cigarette smoke (CS)-inflammation models, we found that neutrophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were similar in Mrp4(-/-) and Mrp4(+/+) mice treated with LPS or CS. Similarly, neutrophil numbers were not reduced in the BALF of LPS-challenged wt mice after treatment with 10 or 30 mg/kg of the Mrp1/4 inhibitor MK571. The absence of Mrp4 also had no impact on the influx of eosinophils or IL-4 and IL-5 levels in the BALF after OVA airway challenge in mice sensitized with OVA/alum. LPS-induced cytokine release in whole blood ex vivo was also not affected by the absence of Mrp4. These data clearly suggest that Mrp4 deficiency alone is not sufficient to reduce inflammatory processes in vivo. We hypothesized that in combination with PDE4 inhibitors, used at suboptimal concentrations, the anti-inflammatory effect would be more pronounced. However, LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment into the lung was no different between Mrp4(-/-) and Mrp4(+/+) mice treated with 3 mg/kg Roflumilast. Finally, the single and combined administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg MK571 and the specific breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor KO143 showed no reduction of LPS-induced TNFα release into the BALF compared to vehicle treated control animals. Similarly, LPS-induced TNFα release in murine whole blood of Mrp4(+/+) or Mrp4(-/-) mice was not reduced by KO143 (1, 10 µM). Thus, BCRP seems not to be able to compensate for the absence or inhibition of Mrp4 in the used models.

,"23532889","PIK3CA mutation is associated with a favorable prognosis among patients with curatively resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","Shigaki H","PURPOSE: PIK3CA encodes the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110α. Mutant PIK3CA stimulates the AKT pathway and promotes cancer cell proliferation. PIK3CA mutations have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal or lung cancer. In contrast, the relationship between PIK3CA mutations and favorable prognoses has been shown in breast cancer. However, the influence of PIK3CA mutations on the prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a nonbiased database of 219 curatively resected ESCCs and eight esophageal cancer cell lines, we evaluated PIK3CA mutational status by pyrosequencing. The expression of p53 and phosphorylated AKT (i.e., AKT activation) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and/or 20 were detected in 46 cases (21%). No ESCC cell line harbored PIK3CA mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with phosphorylated AKT expression, but not with p53 expression, sex, age at surgery, tobacco use, alcohol use, or histologic grade. Compared with wild-type PIK3CA cases, patients with PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and/or 20 experienced significantly better disease-free survival [log-rank P = 0.0089; univariate HR: 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.15-0.75, P = 0.0042; multivariate HR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.10-0.86, P = 0.021] and overall survival (log-rank P = 0.012; univariate HR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16-0.78, P = 0.0060; multivariate HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.10-0.90, P = 0.028).

We present a comprehensive report on the trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Japan using the most recent population-based data.
METHODS: National cancer mortality data between 1958 and 2011 were obtained from published vital statistics. Cancer incidence data between 1985 and 2007 were obtained from high-quality population-based cancer registries of four prefectures (Miyagi, Yamagata, Fukui and Nagasaki). Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to examine the trends in age-standardized rates of cancer incidence and mortality.
RESULTS: All-cancer mortality decreased from the mid-1990s, with an annual percent change of -1.3% (95% confidence interval: -1.4, -1.3), while all-cancer incidence continually increased from 1985, with an annual percent change of 0.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.6, 0.8). Major cancer sites, particularly the liver, colorectum and lung (males), showed a pattern of increasing incidence and mortality rates until the mid-1990s, stabilizing or decreasing thereafter. Stomach cancer showed a long-term decreasing trend for both incidence and mortality, while female breast cancer showed a continuously increasing trend. The incidence of prostate cancer, particularly at the localized stage, increased rapidly between 2000 and 2003, while that of mortality decreased from 2004. No changes were detected in the incidence or mortality for colorectal, female breast or cervical cancers after the establishment of national screening programs for these cancers.

METHODS: We analyzed the association of the tumor p53 mutational status with tumor characteristics, education, and self-reported annual household income (HI) among 173 breast cancer patients from the greater Baltimore area, United States.
RESULTS: p53 mutational frequency was significantly associated with HI. Patients with < $15,000 HI had the highest p53 mutation frequency (21%), followed by the income group between $15,000 and $60,000 (18%), while those above $60,000 HI had the fewest mutations (5%). When dichotomized at $60,000, 26 out of 135 patients in the low income category had acquired a p53 mutation, while only 2 out of 38 with a high income carried a mutation (P < 0.05). In the adjusted logistic regression analysis with 3 income categories (trend test), the association between HI and p53 mutational status was independent of tumor characteristics, age, race/ethnicity, tobacco smoking and body mass. Further analyses revealed that HI may impact the p53 mutational frequency preferentially in patients who develop an estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease. Within this group, 42% of the low income patients (< $15,000 HI) carried a mutation, followed by the middle income group (21%), while those above $60,000 HI did not carry mutations (Ptrend < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: HI is associated with the p53 mutational frequency in patients who develop an ER-negative disease.

METHODS: Data were derived from a longitudinal study of 229 women (age < 70) in Germany with a first manifestation of breast cancer. Food intake, physical activity and smoking were assessed by means of personal interviews immediately after surgery (T0) and 14 months later (T1).
RESULTS: The intake of fruits and vegetables and physical exercise increased significantly over the observation period. Socio-demographic and medical parameters were largely irrelevant for behavioral changes while smoking status turned out as most important for changes in daily fruit consumption.

,"23388463","Cigarette smoke metabolically promotes cancer, via autophagy and premature aging in the host stromal microenvironment.","Salem AF","Cigarette smoke has been directly implicated in the disease pathogenesis of a plethora of different human cancer subtypes, including breast cancers. The prevailing view is that cigarette smoke acts as a mutagen and DNA damaging agent in normal epithelial cells, driving tumor initiation. However, its potential negative metabolic effects on the normal stromal microenvironment have been largely ignored. Here, we propose a new mechanism by which carcinogen-rich cigarette smoke may promote cancer growth, by metabolically ""fertilizing"" the host microenvironment. More specifically, we show that cigarette smoke exposure is indeed sufficient to drive the onset of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype via the induction of DNA damage, autophagy and mitophagy in the tumor stroma. In turn, cigarette smoke exposure induces premature aging and mitochondrial dysfunction in stromal fibroblasts, leading to the secretion of high-energy mitochondrial fuels, such as L-lactate and ketone bodies. Hence, cigarette smoke induces catabolism in the local microenvironment, directly fueling oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in neighboring epithelial cancer cells, actively promoting anabolic tumor growth. Remarkably, these autophagic-senescent fibroblasts increased breast cancer tumor growth in vivo by up to 4-fold. Importantly, we show that cigarette smoke-induced metabolic reprogramming of the fibroblastic stroma occurs independently of tumor neo-angiogenesis. We discuss the possible implications of our current findings for the prevention of aging-associated human diseases and, especially, common epithelial cancers, as we show that cigarette smoke can systemically accelerate aging in the host microenvironment. Finally, our current findings are consistent with the idea that cigarette smoke induces the ""reverse Warburg effect,"" thereby fueling ""two-compartment tumor metabolism"" and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in epithelial cancer cells.","2013",,"Cell Cycle",,"other","Autophagy, TRUE, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, Cellular Senescence, TRUE, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, DNA Damage, FALSE, Down-Regulation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Fibroblasts, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Glycolysis, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Ketone Bodies, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Lactic Acid, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Mitochondria, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Mitophagy, FALSE, Models, Biological, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Oxidative Phosphorylation, FALSE, Retinoblastoma Protein, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Signal Transduction, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Stromal Cells, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Tumor Microenvironment, TRUE, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Deficiencies in DNA repair capacity are thought to associate with breast cancer risk. The main aim of this study was to use the mutagen sensitivity assay as an indirect measure of DNA repair capacity to assess breast cancer risk and the relationship between passive smoking and breast cancer risk among women in China.
METHODS: We carried out a case-control study, involving 196 Chinese patients with breast cancer and 211 controls without the disease and with no history of cancer. We investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and breast cancer risk using bleomycin as the mutagen. Mutagen sensitivity was measured by quantifying the chromatid breaks induced by mutagens in short-term cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Nonparametric tests and the Fisher's exact test were used to determine the statistical significance of the crude case-control comparisons, followed by logistic regression to adjust for important covariates.
RESULTS: The mean number of bleomycin-induced breaks per cell was 0.81 for cases compared with 0.73 for the controls (p = 0.016). A greater number of bleomycin-induced chromosomal breaks per cell was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio of 1.82, p trend <0.01). The association between bleomycin sensitivity and breast cancer risk was greater for women who were exposed to tobacco smoke (passive smokers). The combination of bleomycin sensitivity and exposure to tobacco smoke increased risk further; women passive smokers with high sensitivity to bleomycin had a 2.77-fold increased risk of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that increased bleomycin-induced mutagen sensitivity is significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among Chinese women. Exposure to passive smoke is also associated with increased breast cancer risk, and the correlation is even greater for women with both longer passive exposure to tobacco smoke and high sensitivity to bleomycin.","2013",,"Cancer Causes Control"," The main aim of this study was to use the mutagen sensitivity assay as an indirect measure of DNA repair capacity to assess breast cancer risk and the relationship between passive smoking and breast cancer risk among women in China ","comparative study","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Antibiotics, Antineoplastic, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Asian People, FALSE, Bleomycin, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lymphocytes, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutagenicity Tests, FALSE, Mutagens, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Prognosis, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

RESULTS: About 57.1% had IBR and 42.9% had no reconstruction. The most common reason why IBR had not been performed was that it had not been proposed by the surgeon (33.4%).

DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment, Medical Oncology Department.
PATIENTS: Consecutive patients who started adjuvant trastuzumab between 2007 and 2010.
MAIN OUTCOME: Measures TIC was defined as an absolute left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease ≥ 15 points from baseline or a LVEF<50%. Logistic regression was used to estimate OR and their 95% CI in order to evaluate the risk of TIC, considering potential cardiac risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoke, cardiac ischaemia and previous chest radiotherapy) and protective factors (β-blockers, ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers).
RESULTS: Among 179 patients, 78 cases of TIC (44%, 95% CI 37% to 51%) and four cases of HF (2%, 95% CI 0% to 4%) were reported. 14 patients stopped trastuzumab as a result of TIC. None of the cardiac risk factors or concomitant cardiovascular medications altered the risk of TIC. A previous cumulative dose >240 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin or >500 mg/m(2) of epirubicin increased the risk of TIC compared with lower doses (OR 3.07; 95% CI 1.29 to 7.27, p=0.0011).

We assembled the most recent cancer registry data to estimate the burden of the 17 most common cancers in the region, from Slovenia to Cyprus and Malta.
METHODS: Data were made available for analysis from Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Romania (Cluj County), Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey (Antalya and Izmir provinces). We analysed incidence and mortality of the 17 most common cancers (counts and age-standardised rates, for the most recent year available and for the period 1999-2008). We used Joinpoint regression to quantify recent trends.
FINDINGS: For much of SE Europe, there were no marked declines in overall cancer mortality rates during 1999-2008. In men, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates were high compared to other European countries (age-standardised rates (ASRW) of incidence being 50-60/100,000 in most of the countries), and still increasing in Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey. Prostate cancer incidence rapidly increased throughout the region by 3-12% annually, largely without any clear declines in mortality. Colorectal cancer incidence increased throughout the region, as did mortality especially in Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria (average annual percentage change (AAPC) 1.5-2%). In women, breast cancer mortality significantly declined in Slovenia, Croatia and Malta (Average Annual Percentage of Change [AAPC] -2%, -1% and -5%, respectively), but not elsewhere. Cervical cancer incidence rates remained very high in Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria (ASRW>20/100,000).
INTERPRETATION: Our data confirmed the North West to South East Europe gradient of increasing incidence and mortality rates of tobacco-related cancers, as well as increasing mortality rates of screen-detectable cancers.

Little is known about the health behaviour changes women with breast cancer initiate compared to those made by other women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined changes in body mass index (BMI) and tobacco and alcohol consumption among women with a diagnosis of breast cancer and among cancer-free women. We used data from 23 420 women aged 50-64 years who participated in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort, of whom 449 were diagnosed with breast cancer between baseline (1993-1997) and follow-up (2000-2002), and 22 971 remained cancer-free. We used multiple linear regression analysis to examine differences in BMI and alcohol and tobacco consumption between the two groups and to examine whether demographic and prognostic factors were associated with behavioural changes in women with breast cancer.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in changes in BMI, alcohol and tobacco consumption between the two groups. Only in sub-analyses among women who lost weight between baseline and follow-up, women with breast cancer lost more weight than cancer-free women (β = 0.2; CI 0.1; 0.4), but residual confounding from stage cannot be excluded. Among the women with breast cancer we found no significant changes in BMI, alcohol and tobacco consumption by level of education, marital status, chemotherapy, hormone therapy or radiation.
CONCLUSION: Women with breast cancer did not reduce their BMI, or modify their alcohol use or tobacco consumption compared with cancer-free women. This study indicates that guidelines and interventions to change health behaviour are needed after a cancer diagnosis.","2013",,"Acta Oncol"," Little is known about the health behaviour changes women with breast cancer initiate compared to those made by other women ","other","Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Body Mass Index, TRUE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Carcinoma, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Denmark, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Diet Surveys, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Health Status, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Survivors, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Women, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: Cancer death certifications (for 30 sites) and resident population estimates in 2008 stratified by sex and age were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) database (WHOSIS). Mortality rates were age-standardized on the world standard population.
RESULTS: Cancer deaths registered in Italy in 2008 were 172,783 (97,773 men and 75,010 women), corresponding to age-standardized death rates of 144.1/100,000 men and 84.3/100,000 women. The projected cancer deaths in 2012 are 178,000 (100,000 men, 78,000 women) and the corresponding rates 132,5/100,000 men and 80.5/100,000 women. The favorable trend in lung cancer mortality among men was confirmed, with rates of 37.7/100,000 in 2008 (all ages) and 33.3 for 2012. Other tobacco-related cancers also declined in men but not in women, including pancreatic cancer, whose rates tended to level off over the last 3 years. The fall in female cancer mortality rates continues to be led by favorable trends in breast cancer (16.1/100,000 in 2007 and 15.2 in 2012), intestinal cancer, stomach cancer and uterine cancer. However, the female lung cancer mortality was still rising with 7743 deaths in 2008 (9.5/100,000), and lung cancer is predicted to become the second cause of female cancer mortality by 2012 (8,500 deaths, 9.8/100,000).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced tobacco and alcohol consumption are largely responsible for the favorable trends in cancer mortality in men. Advances in treatment and management accounted for the reduced mortality from colorectal cancer, breast cancer, leukemias and a few other cancers, as well as improved diagnosis for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer. The rising epidemic of tobacco-related deaths in women indicates the need for targeted tobacco-control strategies.","2012",,"Tumori"," AIMS AND BACKGROUND : This report provides up-to-date data and statistics for cancer mortality in Italy in 2008 , and predicts the figures and rates for selected cancer sites for 2012 ","other","Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Digestive System Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Female, FALSE, Forecasting, FALSE, Genital Neoplasms, Female, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Humans, FALSE, Italy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Leukemia, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prostatic Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Risk Reduction Behavior, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Smoking Cessation, FALSE, Survival Rate, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

,"23179580","Smoking and breast cancer.","Reynolds P","The potential role of smoking in breast cancer risk has been the subject of over 100 publications, numerous scientific reviews, and animated debate. Tobacco exposure is a well-established cause of lung cancer, and is thought to account for nearly one third of all cancer deaths. Tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemicals, many of which are known to be mammary carcinogens. Although not initially thought to be a tobacco-related cancer, over the last several decades evidence has been accumulating on the role of both active smoking and secondhand smoking in the etiology of breast cancer. The human health evidence has been systematically evaluated not only by several independent researchers but also by several expert agency panels including those of the U.S. Surgeon General, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the California Environmental Protection Agency, and a coalition of Canadian health agencies. Although the assessments have varied with time and across reviewers, the most recent weight of the evidence has suggested a potentially casual role for active smoking and breast cancer, particularly for long-term heavy smoking and smoking initiation at an early age. The role of secondhand smoking and breast cancer is less clear, although there has been some suggestion for an increased risk for premenopausal breast cancer. Recent studies evaluating the possible modifying role of polymorphisms in genes involved in the metabolism of tobacco products, particularly NAT2, have contributed another dimension to these assessments, although to date that evidence remains equivocal.","2013",,"J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia",," review","Age Factors, FALSE, Animals, FALSE, Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Canada, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Guidelines as Topic, FALSE, Health Policy, FALSE, Health Promotion, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mammary Glands, Animal, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Mammary Glands, Human, FALSE, growth & development, Q000254, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, Pregnancy, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, United States, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We performed two epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) nested in a prospective healthy cohort using the Illumina 450K Methylation Beadchip. The two populations consisted of matched pairs of healthy individuals (n = 374), of which half went on to develop breast or colon cancer. The association was analysed between methylation and smoking status, as well as cancer risk. In addition to the same locus in F2RL3, we report several loci that are hypomethylated in smokers compared with former and non-smokers, including an intragenic region of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor gene (AHRR; cg05575921, P = 2.31 × 10(-15); effect size = 14-17%), an intergenic CpG island on 2q37.1 (cg21566642, P = 3.73 × 10(-13); effect size = 12%) and a further intergenic region at 6p21.33 (cg06126421, P = 4.96 × 10(-11), effect size = 7-8%). Bisulphite pyrosequencing validated six loci in a further independent population of healthy individuals (n = 180). Methylation levels in AHRR were also significantly decreased (P < 0.001) and expression increased (P = 0.0047) in the lung tissue of current smokers compared with non-smokers. This was further validated in a mouse model of smoke exposure. We observed an association with breast cancer risk for the 2q37.1 locus (P = 0.003, adjusted for the smoking status), but not for the other loci associated with smoking.

We also undertook a systematic review of all cohort studies to date that have examined the association between smoking and breast cancer mortality. Compared with never smokers, women who were current smokers had a twofold higher rate of dying from breast cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.01, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.27-3.18] and an approximately fourfold higher rate of dying from competing (non-breast cancer) causes (HR = 3.84, 95 % CI 2.50-5.89).

However, the relation between healthy lifestyles and the prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer has not been an explicit component in school curricula of younger age groups. We sought to explore the level of knowledge among 6th grade students as well as their attitudes with respect to cancer. This comes as part of a pilot project to develop an educational series on cancer prevention that aims to meet knowledge gaps specific to the community of students in this age group in Jordan.
METHODS: A questionnaire composed of items measuring knowledge about cancer and cancer prevention through healthy practices, attitudes towards cancer, and intentions to engage in healthy behaviors was developed. Questionnaires previously used in similar age groups elsewhere were used as a reference. Our questionnaire was reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education - School Health &amp; Nutrition Department. Sixth graders in a convenience sample of four schools selected by the Ministry of Education completed the self-administered questionnaire.
RESULTS: Ninety-six 6th graders from four schools answered the baseline survey, but 28% of the surveys were excluded from the analysis (data quality problems) leaving 69 student participants. In the original sample of 96 students, 48 (69.6%) were girls. Among the 69 student participants, 67 (97.1%) had heard of cancer, but fewer than 44 (63.8% knew it was not a contagious disease. Regarding fear, 29 (42%) would not play with a cancer patient. Concerning prevention of the most prevalent cancers in Jordan as research has shown that certain risk factors increase the chance that a person will develop cancer. The most common risk factors are smoking, Poor diet, lack of physical activity, or being overweight, 25 (36.2%) knew breast cancer was preventable, and 28 (40.6%) and 24 (34.8%) knew this regarding lung and colorectal cancers, respectively. About 40 (57.8%) students identified healthy dietary behaviors (e.g., low fat, low sugar), but only six could identify the ideal frequency for exercise (60 minutes daily). Fifty-eight (84.1%) agreed that cigarettes harmed the health. However, only 21 (30.4%) found it easy to avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Nine (13%) reported smoking water pipes, but only one reported smoking cigarettes. Forty-eight (69.6%) and 47 (68.1%) agreed that daily physical activity and healthy eating were important, respectively. Fifty-two (75.4%) students found it easy to eat healthy at home, but only 37 (53.6%) found it easy to do so at school. Finally, 63 (91.3%) students wanted to learn more about cancer.
CONCLUSION: Although a significant number of our sample of students has heard about cancer and students exhibit some knowledge regarding healthy practices, our results show that knowledge gaps exist with regard to the nature of cancer as a noncontagious disease, the preventability of specific cancers, and the link between specific risk factors and cancer.","2012",,"Stud Health Technol Inform"," We sought to explore the level of knowledge among 6th grade students as well as their attitudes with respect to cancer ","other","Child, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Health Behavior, FALSE, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Jordan, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Risk Assessment, TRUE, Risk-Taking, TRUE, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

This meeting followed the Special Session on HIV/AIDS in 2001, the only other high-level meeting to discuss a health topic and orient the global political agenda toward a growing threat to human development. Proposed strategies for control of noncommunicable diseases focused mainly on the shared risk factors of tobacco, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet. However, for cancer, a broader response is required. Notably, the heterogeneity of cancer with respect to its geographical distribution, etiology, and pathology all demand a more nuanced, regional, or even local approach. Preparations for the meeting elicited enormous attention from governments and nongovernmental organizations, but the engagement of the research community was less evident. This commentary calls for the involvement of the cancer research community in response to the further action detailed in the United Nations Political Declaration emanating from the meeting, identifies a number of cancer-specific priorities, including vaccination against hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus, cervical cancer screening, and early detection of breast cancer, and suggests areas where cancer research can provide the evidence base for cancer control, notably in improving the quality and coverage of cancer registration, elucidating cancer etiology, and evaluating interventions, including their implementation in low-resource health-care settings.

Most low- and middle-income countries have a cancer control strategy and/or an action plan; however, coverage of cancer registration is still very low and does not meet the international standard in terms of quality. Therefore, only limited data were available for the recent global estimation of cancer burden. Large variations, in both cancer incidence and mortality, were observed in the populations in the different sub-regions of Asia. The most common cancer in males is lung cancer in the Eastern and South Eastern sub-regions, while prostate cancer comes close to lung cancer in the Pacific Island countries. In females, breast cancer is the most common in all three regions. The predominance of lung, stomach, colorectal, prostate, breast and cervical cancers makes cancer control more amenable in the Asia Pacific region. Up-to-date statistics on cancer occurrence and outcome are essential for the planning and evaluation of cancer control programmes.

Although avoidance of tobacco abuse and smoking cessation clearly will have the greatest impact on lung cancer development, effective chemoprevention could prove to be more effective than treatment of established, advanced-stage disease. Chemoprevention is the use of dietary or pharmaceutical agents to reverse or block the carcinogenic process and has been successfully applied to common malignancies other than lung (including recent reports on the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk individuals). Despite previous studies in lung cancer chemoprevention failing to identify effective agents, our ability to define the highest-risk populations and the understanding of lung tumor and premalignant biology continue to make advances. Squamous cell carcinogenesis in the bronchial epithelium starts with normal epithelium and progresses through hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer. Precursor lesions also have been identified for adenocarcinoma, and these premalignant lesions are targeted by chemopreventive agents in current and future trials.

METHODS: Weight and height and other variables of interest, tumor characteristics and current clinical status 3 yr after diagnosis were retrieved from medical files of breast cancer women diagnosed during 2006. A total of 159 cases with complete information were studied and categorized according to the World Health Organization criteria in normal-/under-weight, overweight, and obese.
RESULTS: Among breast cancer patients, 70.4% were classified as overweight/ obese and 29.6% as normal weight. Prevalence of obesity was high (38.4%) in comparison with information reported for healthy women of the same region (27.11%) and was higher among post-menopausal patients and in women with low level of alcohol and tobacco consumption. Moreover, overweight/ obese cases (79.5%) tended to have more often human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status negative when compared with those with normal weight (70.2%; p=0.097) and the survival curves tended to be influenced by body mass index although without statistical significance.

The intervention is expected to reduce serum insulin and sex hormones, which were associated with breast prognosis in previous studies.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, the study randomly assigned 1208 patients to an intensive diet and exercise intervention or to a comparison group, to be followed-up through 2015. General lifestyle recommendations for the prevention of cancer are given to both groups, and the intervention group is being offered a comprehensive lifestyle intervention, including cooking classes, conferences, common meals and exercise sessions. Adherence assessments occurred at baseline and at 12 months and are planned at 36 and 60 months. They include food frequency diaries, anthropometric measures, body fat distribution assessed with impedance scale, one week registration of physical activity with a multisensor arm-band monitor, metabolic and endocrine blood parameters. Outcome breast cancer events are assessed through self report at semi annual meetings or telephone interview and are validated through medical record verification.
RESULTS: The randomized groups were comparable for age (51.8 years), proportion of ER-negative tumors (22%), axillary node metastasis (42%), reproductive variables, tobacco smoking, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements and hormonal and metabolic parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: DIANA-5 has the potential to establish whether a Mediterranean-macrobiotic lifestyle may reduce breast cancer recurrences. We will assess evidence of effectiveness, first by comparing the incidence of additional breast cancer events (local or distant recurrence, second ipsilateral or contralateral cancer) in the intervention and in the control group, by an intention-to-treat analysis, and second by analyzing the incidence of breast cancer events in the total study population by compliance assessment score.","2012",,"Tumori"," AIMS AND BACKGROUND : The DIANA ( Diet and Androgens ) -5 study is a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of a diet based on Mediterranean and macrobiotic recipes and principles , associated with moderate physical activity , in reducing additional breast cancer events in women with early stage","randomized controlled trial","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Body Fat Distribution, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Caloric Restriction, FALSE, Diet Records, FALSE, Diet, Mediterranean, TRUE, Energy Metabolism, FALSE, Exercise, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Gonadal Steroid Hormones, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Humans, FALSE, Insulin, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Insulin-Like Growth Factor I, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Italy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Life Style, TRUE, Lymphatic Metastasis, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasm Recurrence, Local, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Patient Compliance, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Research Design, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Risk Reduction Behavior, TRUE, Secondary Prevention, FALSE, methods, Q000379","Mediterranean","breast cancer",1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

In animal studies oral intake of acrylamide has been related to cancer development, with indications that the increased cancer occurrence especially regards endocrine related tumors. In human epidemiological studies, dietary exposure to acrylamide has also been suggested related to higher risk of endocrine related tumors, like estrogen sensitive breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if pre-diagnostic acrylamide exposure, measured by acrylamide and glycidamide hemoglobin adducts (AA-Hb and GA-Hb), were associated to mortality in breast cancer cases. Among 24,697 postmenopausal women included into a Danish cohort between 1993 and 1997, 420 developed breast cancer before 2001 and 110 died before 2009. AA-Hb and GA-Hb concentrations measured in blood samples were related to mortality by Cox proportional hazard models. Estimates are given per 25 pmol/g globin higher levels. Among non-smokers, higher concentrations of GA-Hb were associated to a higher hazard rate of breast cancer specific mortality (HR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.06-2.51)), the hazard rate among women diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive tumors was (HR (95% CI): 2.23 (1.38-3.61)). For AA-Hb the tendency was similar, but only statistically significant among those with estrogen receptor positive tumors (HR (95% CI): 1.31 (1.02-1.69)).

DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on epidemiological modelling.
INTERVENTIONS: 101 intervention strategies relating to nine major clusters of non-communicable disease: depression, heavy alcohol use, tobacco use, cataracts, breast cancer, cervical cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.
DATA SOURCES: Mexican data sources were used for most key input parameters, including administrative registries; disease burden and population estimates; household surveys; and drug price databases. These sources were supplemented as needed with estimates for Mexico from the WHO-CHOICE unit cost database or with estimates extrapolated from the published literature.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Population health outcomes, measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs); costs in 2005 international dollars ($Int); and costs per DALY.
RESULTS: Across 101 intervention strategies examined in this study, average yearly costs at the population level would range from around ≤$Int1m (such as for cataract surgeries) to >$Int1bn for certain strategies for primary prevention in cardiovascular disease. Wide variation also appeared in total population health benefits, from <1000 DALYs averted a year (for some components of cancer treatments or aspirin for acute ischaemic stroke) to >300,000 averted DALYs (for aggressive combinations of interventions to deal with alcohol use or cardiovascular risks). Interventions in this study spanned a wide range of average cost effectiveness ratios, differing by more than three orders of magnitude between the lowest and highest ratios. Overall, community and public health interventions such as non-personal interventions for alcohol use, tobacco use, and cardiovascular risks tended to have lower cost effectiveness ratios than many clinical interventions (of varying complexity). Even within the community and public health interventions, however, there was a 200-fold difference between the most and least cost effective strategies examined. Likewise, several clinical interventions appeared among the strategies with the lowest average cost effectiveness ratios-for example, cataract surgeries.

BACKGROUND: There is an increased emphasis on clinical outcomes to improve the quality of surgical care. Although mastectomy and breast conserving surgery have low risk for complications, few US studies have examined the incidence of these complications in large, multicenter patient populations. The broad scale of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data set facilitates multivariate analysis of patient characteristics that predispose to development of postoperative complications in breast cancer surgery.
METHODS: A prospective, multi-institutional study of patients undergoing mastectomy and breast conserving surgery was performed from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2007. Study subjects were selected as a random sample of patients at more than 200 participating community and academic medical centers. Thirty-day morbidity was prospectively collected and the incidence of postoperative complications was determined, with particular emphasis on superficial and deep surgical site infections. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative wound infections in each.
RESULTS: A total of 26,988 patients were identified who underwent mastectomy (N = 10,471) and breast conserving surgery (N = 16,517). As expected, the overall 30-day morbidity rate for all procedures was low (5.6%), with significantly higher morbidity for mastectomies (4.0%) than breast conserving surgery (1.6%, P < 0.001). The most common complications in all procedures were superficial surgical site infections and deep surgical site infections. Independent risk factors for development of any wound infection in patients undergoing mastectomy were a high body mass index, smoking, and diabetes (ORs = 1.8, 1.6, 1.8). In patients who had a lumpectomy, a high body mass index, smoking, and a history of surgery within 90 days prior to this procedure (ORs = 1.7, 1.9, 2.0) were independent risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Although complication rates in breast cancer surgery are low, wound infections remain the most common complication. A high body mass index and current tobacco use were the only independent risk factors for development of a postoperative wound infection across all procedures. This study highlights the benefit of a multi-institutional database in assessing risk factors for adverse outcomes in breast cancer surgery.","2012",,"Ann Surg"," OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of complications of breast cancer surgery in a multi-institutional , prospective , validated database and to identify preoperative risk factors that predispose to these complications ","other","Body Mass Index, TRUE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, surgery, Q000601, Databases, Factual, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multivariate Analysis, FALSE, Postoperative Complications, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediates endocrine disruptive activities of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins, which may compromise ovarian functions of women in polluted environments. This study focused on tissue expression levels of AhR and associations with exposure to chemicals with estrogen-like activities (xenoestrogens) and other reproductive factors in premenopausal breast cancer patients. Fifty cases who underwent surgery from June 2009 to June 2010 were matched with 100 controls by age and hospital records. AhR overexpression was detected in 87% of epithelial cells of young breast cancer patients. Living near factories generating PAHs and dioxins was considered as a major risk factor in premenopausal breast cancer (p=0.001, OR=4.8). History of idiopathic infertility was identified as a second significant risk factor (p=0.002, OR=3.50), which could be affected by endogenous estrogen levels. Long term (>5 yrs) consumption of oral contraceptive pills was identified as the third most important risk factor (p=0.006, OR=2.27). Adiposity and abnormal weight gain after 18 years were considered as two major background factors, which may contribute to the levels of endogenous estrogens. Direct and indirect exposure to cigarette smoke (p=0.005, OR=1.43) was considered as a weak risk factor without association with AhR levels. It seems that AhR overexpression is affected by exposure to xenoestrogens and by adiposity.

Furthermore, cancers such as lung, female breast, and prostate cancers are diagnosed at much higher frequencies than in the past because of changes in lifestyle factors and detection practices associated with urbanization and economic development. Breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men have now become the most commonly diagnosed cancers in many Sub-Saharan African countries, replacing cervical and liver cancers. In most African countries, cancer control programs and the provision of early detection and treatment services are limited despite this increasing burden.

DNA (saliva) was available for 920 breast cancer cases and 960 controls. Detailed information about passive smoke exposure was collected for multiple age periods (childhood, teenage years, and adulthood) and environments (home, work, and social). Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by multivariable logistic regression, and statistical interactions were assessed using the likelihood ratio test. Among postmenopausal women, most associations between passive smoke and breast cancer risk were null, whereas among premenopausal women, nonsignificant positive associations were observed. Significant interactions were observed between certain types of passive smoke exposure and genetic variants in CYP2E1, NAT2, and UGT1A7. While these interactions were statistically significant, the magnitudes of the effect estimates were not consistent or easily interpretable, suggesting that they were perhaps due to chance.

Earlier studies demonstrated that most general surgeons do not discuss reconstructive options with patients. The aim of this study was to examine the likelihood of reconstruction within a cohort of mastectomy patients and compare rates of reconstruction between those referred and not referred for plastic surgery evaluation.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of the records of 471 consecutive patients between the ages of 19 and 94 years who underwent mastectomy between 2003 and 2007. Variables evaluated were age, body mass index, diabetes, laterality (unilateral vs bilateral), TNM staging, history of radiation, smoking history, insurance type, and race.
RESULTS: Of 471 patients, 313 were referred for consultation with a plastic surgeon and 158 were not; 91.7% of those referred were reconstructed and 100% of those not referred were not reconstructed. The 2 groups differed considerably in terms of age (mean age 61.84 years in the nonreferred group vs 51.83 years in the referred group), body mass index (25.9 in referred group, 27 in nonreferred group), diabetes (15% in nonreferred group vs 3.5% in referred group), and laterality (14% of nonreferred group underwent bilateral mastectomies vs 26% of those referred). The groups did not differ significantly in terms of race or tobacco use. Those with private insurance were more likely to be reconstructed, but no independent effect of insurance type was seen on multivariate analysis.

However, patients with a unique subset of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated HNSCC have been documented to have a better survival outcome. These tumors occur more frequently in the tonsils and oropharyngeal sites, among younger patients, higher socioeconomic group, and those exposed to more sexual partners and oral sex compared with HPV-negative HNSCC. Although tobacco- and alcohol-related HNSCCs appear to be on the decline, tonsillar and oropharyngeal HPV-associated tumors seem to be on the rise, and their prevalence varies widely in published reports, ranging from 20% to 60%. Human papilloma virus detection methods in tumor tissue vary and include polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization (ISH) technique for HPV DNA, and E6/E7 messenger RNA, with p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a surrogate marker. The sensitivity and specificity of the different methods used are likely contributory factors to this wide variation. This study compares the p16 IHC staining patterns in HNSCC and laryngeal papillomas and assesses the concordance of p16 and high-risk HPV-ISH to determine the usefulness of p16 as a first-line marker. Using an objective criterion of diffuse intense confluent staining pattern as definite positive (akin to the 3+ of HER2/neu in breast cancer) and focal scattered staining pattern as equivocal reaction requiring confirmatory HPV assay, p16 IHC expression shows good concordance with high-risk HPV-ISH and can be used as a first-line marker.

For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)--a total of about 134,000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60, 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)--responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population-attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level.","2011",,"Br J Cancer",,"comparative study","Diet, FALSE, Environment, TRUE, Environmental Health, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Life Style, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Occupational Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, United Kingdom, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We conducted a prospective study of prenatal smoke exposure, childhood household smoke exposure, and adult active smoke exposure and mammographic density, a strong intermediate marker of breast cancer risk, in an adult follow-up of existing US birth cohorts. Specifically, we followed up women who were born between 1959 and 1967 and whose mothers participated in either the Collaborative Perinatal Project (Boston and Providence sites) or the Childhood Health and Development Study in California. Of the 1134 women interviewed in adulthood (ranging in age from 39 to 49 years at interview), 79% had a screening mammogram. Cigarette smoking was reported by mothers at the time of their pregnancy; 40% of mothers smoked while pregnant. Women whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had a 3.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) = -6.0%, -0.2%) lower mammographic density than women whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy. When we further accounted for adult body mass index and adult smoking status, the association remained (β = -2.7, 95% CI = -5.0, -0.3). When we examined patterns of smoking, prenatal smoke exposure without adult smoke exposure was associated with a 5.6% decrease in mammographic density (β = -5.6, 95% CI = -9.6, -1.6). Given the strength of mammographic density as an intermediate marker for breast cancer, the inverse associations between mammographic density and smoking patterns across the lifecourse may help explain the complex association between cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk.","2011",,"J Dev Orig Health Dis",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

,"22085699","Sensitization of epithelial growth factor receptors by nicotine exposure to promote breast cancer cell growth.","Nishioka T","INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoke is known to be the main cause of lung, head and neck tumors. Recently, evidence for an increasing breast cancer risk associated with tobacco smoke exposure has been emerging. We and other groups have shown that nicotine, as a non-conventional carcinogen, has the potential to facilitate cancer genesis and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the smoke affects the breast, rather than the lung, remain unclear. Here, we examine possible downstream signaling pathways of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and their role in breast cancer promotion.
METHODS: Using human benign MCF10A and malignant MDA-MB-231 breast cells and specific inhibitors of possible downstream kinases, we identified nAChR effectors that were activated by treatment with nicotine. We further tested the effects of these effector pathways on the regulation of E2F1 activation, cell cycle progression and on Bcl-2 expression and long-term cell survival.
RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated a novel signaling mechanism by which nicotine exposure activated Src to sensitize epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated pathways for breast cancer cell growth promotion. After the ligation of nAChR with nicotine, EGFR was shown to be activated and then internalized in both MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Subsequently, Src, Akt and ERK1/2 were phosphorylated at different time points following nicotine treatment. We further demonstrated that through Src, the ligation of nicotine with nAChR stimulated the EGFR/ERK1/2 pathway for the activation of E2F1 and further cell progression. Our data also showed that Akt functioned directly downstream of Src and was responsible for the increase of Bcl-2 expression and long-term cell survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the existence of a potential, regulatory network governed by the interaction of nicotine and nAChR that integrates the conventional, mitogenic Src and EGFR signals for breast cancer development.","2011",,"Breast Cancer Res",,"other","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Carcinogens, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Cell Survival, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, E2F1 Transcription Factor, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, ErbB Receptors, FALSE, agonists, Q000819, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, MAP Kinase Signaling System, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Nicotine, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Protein Binding, FALSE, Receptors, Nicotinic, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Signal Transduction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Up-Regulation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, src-Family Kinases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The authors sought to replicate the latter hypothesis in a prospective analysis of 6,900 breast cancer cases and 9,903 matched controls drawn from 6 cohorts (1989-2006) in the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. Standardized methods were used to genotype the 3 most common polymorphisms that define NAT2 acetylation phenotype (rs1799930, rs1799931, and rs1801280). In unconditional logistic regression analyses, breast cancer risk was higher in women with more than 20 pack-years of active cigarette smoking than in never smokers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 1.39), after controlling for established risk factors other than alcohol consumption and physical inactivity. However, associations were similar for the slow (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.39) and rapid/intermediate (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.42) acetylation phenotypes, with no evidence of interaction (P = 0.87).

Both compounds are rodent mammary carcinogens, and putative DNA adducts of PhIP and 4-ABP have been frequently detected, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or (32)P-post-labeling methods, in mammary tissue of USA women. Because of these findings, PhIP and 4-ABP have been implicated as causal agents of human breast cancer. However, the biomarker data are controversial: both IHC and (32)P-post-labeling are non-selective screening methods and fail to provide confirmatory spectral data. Consequently, the identities of the lesions are equivocal. We employed a specific and sensitive liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) method, to screen tumor-adjacent normal mammary tissue for DNA adducts of PhIP and 4-ABP. Only 1 of 70 biopsy samples obtained from Minneapolis, Minnesota breast cancer patients contained a PhIP-DNA adduct. The level was three adducts per 10(9) nucleotides, a level that is 100-fold lower than the mean level of PhIP adducts reported by IHC or (32)P-post-labeling methods. The occurrence of 4-ABP-DNA adducts was nil in those same breast tissues. Our findings, derived from a specific mass spectrometry method, signify that PhIP and 4-ABP are not major DNA-damaging agents in mammary tissue of USA women and raise questions about the roles of these chemicals in breast cancer.","2012",,"Carcinogenesis",,"other","Aminobiphenyl Compounds, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Breast, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Chromatography, Liquid, FALSE, methods, Q000379, DNA Adducts, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Diet, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Hepatocytes, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Imidazoles, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Immunohistochemistry, FALSE, Meat, FALSE, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

RESULTS: Lack of regular mammograms (<2 mammograms in the 4.5 years before diagnosis) was the strongest correlate of symptom-detected breast cancer (OR = 3.04 for irregular or no mammograms). In women who had regular mammograms (≥ 2 mammograms in the 4.5 years before diagnosis), the independent correlates of symptom-detected cancers were low BMI (OR < 25 kg/m(2) vs. ≥ 30 kg/m(2) = 2.18, 95% CI 1.23-3.84; p = 0.008), increased breast density (available in 498 women) (OR highest quarter vs. lowest = 3.50, 95% CI 1.76-6.97; p (trend) = 0.004), high-grade cancer, and a larger cancer (each p < 0.01). In women who did not have regular mammograms, the independent correlates were age <50 years, a first cancer, and a ≥ 2-cm cancer.

Despite the encouraging reduction in deaths observed by using LDCT in the NLST study population, recommending adoption of lung cancer screening in general practice is premature. Lessons learned from prostate and breast cancer screening should remind us that the reductions in deaths expected with screening are unfortunately not as readily achievable as initially believed. Furthermore, the potential harms of false-positive findings on chest computed tomography are very real. The morbidity and even mortality associated with invasive diagnostic testing and surgical resection due to false- and true-positive findings on computed tomography are likely to increase when the approach taken in the NLST is applied in non-specialty care settings and among the population at highest risk, namely, those with smoking-related comorbid conditions.

These estimates are based on a large number of epidemiological studies and are generally consistent across strata of several covariates. The evidence suggests that at low doses of alcohol consumption (i.e., ≤1 drink/day) the risk is also increased by about 20% for oral and pharyngeal cancer and 30% for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, for these sites there is little evidence of a threshold effect. While consumption of fewer than 3 alcoholic drinks/wk is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, an intake of 3 to 6 drinks/wk might already yield a (small) increase in risk.

There are various recommendations from the World Health Organization which include the need for governments to pay particular attention to protect women from the tobacco companies' attempts to lure them into lifetimes of nicotine dependence and to take up counter advertisements against the tobacco companies.","2011",,"Cent Eur J Public Health",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Advertising, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Cross-Cultural Comparison, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Sex Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Socioeconomic Factors, FALSE, Tobacco Industry, FALSE, economics, Q000191, Women's Health, TRUE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

A search of the published literature through August 2010 identified 23 papers reporting on associations between smoking before a first pregnancy and breast cancer. Odds ratios or hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for known or suspected breast cancer risk factors, were abstracted from each study. Data were pooled using both fixed- and random-effects models. The fixed-effect summary risk ratio for breast cancer among the women who smoked before their first pregnancy versus women who had never smoked was 1.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.14); the random-effects estimate was similar. The separate fixed-effect risk ratios for smoking only before the first pregnancy (5 studies) or only after the first pregnancy (16 studies) were both 1.07, providing no evidence that breast tissue is more susceptible to malignant transformation from smoking before the first pregnancy. While these small summary risk ratios may represent causal effects, residual confounding could readily produce estimates of this size in the absence of any causal effect.","2011",,"Am J Epidemiol",,"meta analysis","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Parity, FALSE, Pregnancy, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: The 1981 to 2001 censuses were linked to subsequent cancer registrations, giving 47.5 million person-years of follow-up. RESULTS ETHNICITY: Pooled over time, differences were marked: Pacific and Māori rates of cervical, endometrial, stomach and pancreatic cancers were 1.5-2.5 times European/Other rates; Māori, Pacific and Asian rates of liver cancer were 5 times European/Other; European/Other rates of colorectal, bladder and brain cancers were 1.5-2 times the rates of other groups and melanoma rates 5-10 times higher; Pacific and Asian kidney cancer rates were half those of Māori and European/Other. Over time, Māori and Pacific rates of cervical cancer fell faster and Māori rates of colorectal and breast cancer increased faster, than European/Other rates. Male lung cancer rates decreased for European/Other, were stable for Māori and increased for Pacific. Female lung cancer rates increased for all ethnic groups. INCOME: Other than lung (rate ratio 1.35 men, 1.56 women), cervical (1.35) and stomach cancer (1.23), differences in incidence by income were modest or absent.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco explains many of the social group trends and differences and constitutes an inequity. Cervical cancer trends are plausibly explained by screening and sexual practices. Faster increases of colorectal and breast cancer among Māori are presumably due to changes in dietary and reproductive behaviour, but the higher Māori breast cancer rate is unexplained. Ethnic differences in bladder, brain, endometrial and kidney cancer cannot be fully explained.","2011",,"Cancer Causes Control",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Ethnicity, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Health Status Disparities, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, economics, Q000191, New Zealand, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Population Groups, FALSE, Social Class, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: Using data from the national, population-based, 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, 66 cases of male breast cancer were identified (mean age = 66.2 years, mean time since diagnosis = 12.0 years). Male breast cancer cases were matched with 198 male BRFSS respondents with no history of cancer (control group) on age, education, and minority status. The male breast cancer and control groups were compared on physical and mental health status and health behaviors, using t-test and logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: The male breast cancer group reported poorer physical and mental health than controls. Male breast cancer survivors were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to be obese (Odds Ratio = 2.41) and reported more physical comorbidities (Effect Size = 0.45) and activity limitations (Odds Ratio = 3.17), poorer life satisfaction (Effect Size = 0.41) and general health (Effect Size = 0.40), and more days in the past month when mental health (Effect Size = 0.49), and physical health (Effect Size = 0.29) were not good.

In contrast to constitutive cyclooxygenase one (COX-1), COX-2 is induced by proinflammatory factors. Polymorphism -765 G/C in COX-2-encoding gene promoter is associated with development of Alzheimer's disease, depression, carcinoma of the pancreas in smokers, breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. It is interesting whether the -765 G/C polymorphism in COX-2-encoding gene promoter can be associated with COPD, a disease which is inflammatory in character. It is highly probable as the breast and pancreas cancers, whose associations with the analyzed polymorphism have been studied, are smoking-dependent tumors. Additionally, tobacco smoke has been demonstrated to induce COX-2 in the lungs. The study group consisted of 122 COPD patients (48 females, 74 males). The control group consisted of 149 healthy nonsmoking subjects (83 females, 66 males). Polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism was used for genotyping. A statistically significant difference in genotype distribution was observed as a result of the comparison between healthy subjects and patients with COPD. The distribution of alleles in both groups conformed with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In the group of COPD patients, GG allele was found in 79 subjects, GC in 36, and CC in 7 subjects (F = 0.094, P = 0.296927); in the control group, 73 subjects had GG allele, 68--GC and 8--CC (F = 0.12728, P = 0.120265). The allele frequency revealed differences between those groups, attaining the level of statistical significance (χ(2) = 29.043, df = 2, P = 0.0000. The carriers of -765 G allele are at 1.53-fold higher risk of developing COPD. The presence of GG genotype does not increase significantly the risk of the disease.

METHODS: New South Wales opioid substitution therapy (OST) program registrants from 1985 to 2005 (n=43,789) were probabilistically linked to the National Death Index. Crude and standardised mortality rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The crude cancer mortality rate increased from 4 to 65 deaths per 100,000 person-years (p trend <0.001). Overall, OST registrants were 1.7 times more likely to die of cancer than the general population (SMR 95% CI 1.4-1.9). Site-specific SMRs were significantly elevated for lung cancer (3.6, 95% CI 2.8-4.6), liver cancer (6.9, 95% CI 4.3-10.5), and anogenital cancers (2.8, 95% CI 1.3-5.3), and significantly reduced for breast cancer (0.4, 95% CI 0.1-0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer is an increasingly important cause of death among OST registrants as they live longer with their dependency. The site-specific excess deaths suggest the role of tobacco, alcohol, and infection with hepatitis C and human papillomavirus.

Indeed, incidence and mortality among Japanese women have increased over the past three decades. Here, we review epidemiological evidence from our cohort and case-control studies among Japanese women in comparison with other published findings. Our studies confirm the important role of established factors derived primarily from Western populations, such as menstrual and reproductive factors, anthropometric factors, physical activity, and alcohol intake, in the development of breast cancer. In addition, we provide further evidence to better understand the role of traditional Japanese foods in the etiology of breast cancer. Our cohort study found that a higher intake of isoflavone and higher levels of plasma genistein, but not daidzein, were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Our case-control studies reveal a dose-response pattern for these compounds; specifically, decreased risk as women move from ""no"" to ""moderate"" intake and leveling off thereafter. In addition, gene-environment interactions have been revealed in the effects of isoflavones. The evidence reviewed suggests that isoflavone has a protective effect against breast cancer in Asian populations. Conversely, our cohort study did not observe an inverse association between breast cancer risk and the intake of green tea and/or the plasma level of tea polyphenols, but we did find an association between increased risk and active and passive smoking.

Avoided deaths, compared with rates of 1988, from lung, intestinal, stomach, and breast cancers amount to 30 646. In men, trends were driven by cancers of the lung and other tobacco-related sites, intestines, and stomach. Favorable trends for cancers of the breast, intestines, stomach, and uterus contributed to falls in mortality rate in women. Downward trends were seen in both sexes for Hodgkin's lymphoma, bone cancer, and leukemias. Lung cancer in women showed an upward trend, with mortality rates increasing by 2.6% yearly since 1997, becoming the second cause of cancer mortality in middle-aged women. Rising trends were seen in women for oral and pancreatic cancers, as well. The favorable trends in cancer mortality are related to reduced tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption in men, advancements in treatment and management for colorectal cancer, breast cancer, leukemias, and a few other rare treatable cancers, and improved diagnosis of colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers.

Two functional polymorphisms in the EPHX1 gene, Tyr113His and His139Arg can alter the enzyme activity, suggesting their possible association with carcinogenesis risk, particularly of some tobacco-related cancers.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of available studies on these two polymorphisms and cancer risk published up to November 2010, consisting of 84 studies (31144 cases and 42439 controls) for Tyr113His and 77 studies (28496 cases and 38506 controls) for His139Arg primarily focused on lung cancer, upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancers (including oral, pharynx, larynx and esophagus cancers), colorectal cancer or adenoma, bladder cancer and breast cancer. Results showed that Y113H low activity allele (H) was significantly associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (OR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.80-0.96) and UADT cancers (OR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.77-0.97) and H139R high activity allele (R) with increased risk of lung cancer (OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.04-1.33) but not of UADT cancers (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.93-1.17). Pooled analysis of lung and UADT cancers revealed that low EPHX1 enzyme activity, predicted by the combination of Y113H and H139R showed decreased risk of these cancers (OR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.75-0.93) whereas high EPHX1 activity increased risk of the cancers (OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 0.98-1.46). Furthermore, modest difference for the risk of lung and UADT cancers was found between cigarette smokers and nonsmokers both in single SNP analyses (low activity allele H: OR = 0.77/0.85 for smokers/nonsmokers; high activity allele R: OR = 1.20/1.09 for smokers/nonsmokers) and in combined double SNP analyses (putative low activity: OR = 0.73/0.88 for smokers/nonsmokers; putative high activity: OR = 1.02/0.93 for smokers/ nonsmokers).

These evaluations are published as a series of Monographs (www.iarc.fr). For breast cancer the following substances have been classified as ""carcinogenic to humans"" (Group 1): alcoholic beverages, exposure to diethylstilbestrol, estrogen-progestogen contraceptives, estrogen-progestogen hormone replacement therapy and exposure to X-radiation and gamma-radiation (in special populations such as atomic bomb survivors, medical patients, and in-utero exposure).

We present the estimates of the cancer burden in Turkey for 2006, calculated using data from the eight population based cancer registries which have been set up in selected provinces representative of sociodemographic patterns in their regions.
METHODS: We calculated age specific and age adjusted incidence rates (AAIR-world standard population) for each of registries separately. We assigned a weighting coefficient for each registry proportional to the population size of the region which the registry represents.
RESULTS: We pooled a total of 24,428 cancers (14,581 males, 9,847 females). AAIRs per 100 000 were: 210.1 in men and 129.4 in women for all cancer sites excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. The AAIR per 100 000 men was highest for lung cancer (60.3) followed by prostate (22.8), bladder (19.6), stomach (16.3) and colo-rectal (15.4) cancers. Among women the rate per 100 000 was highest for breast cancer (33.7) followed by colorectal (11.5), stomach (8.8), thyroid (8.8) and lung (7.7). The most striking findings about the cancer incidence in the provinces were the high incidence rates for stomach and esophageal cancers in Erzurum and high stomach cancer incidence rates in Trabzon for both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: We are thus able to present the most accurate and realistic estimations for cancer incidence in Turkey so far. Lung, prostate, bladder, stomach, colorectal, larynx cancers in men and breast, colorectal, stomach, thyroid, lung, corpus uteri cancers in women are the leading cancers respectively. This figure shows us tobacco related cancers, lung, bladder and larynx, predominate in men. Concurrently, we analyzed the data for each province separately, giving us the opportunity to present the differences in cancer patterns among provinces. The high incidences of stomach and esophageal cancers in East and high incidence of stomach cancer in Northeast regions are remarkable.","2010",,"Asian Pac J Cancer Prev"," PURPOSE : The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed report on cancer incidence in Turkey , a relatively large country with a population of 72 million ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prognosis, FALSE, Registries, FALSE, Survival Rate, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE, Turkey, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a healthy lifestyle index on the risk of breast cancer.
METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Mexico from 2004 to 2007. One thousand incident cases and 1,074 controls, matched to cases by 5-year age category, region, and health institution, participated in the study. A healthy lifestyle index was developed by means of principal components by using dietary pattern, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A conditional logistic regression model was used to assess this association.
RESULTS: The healthy lifestyle index was defined as the combined effect of moderate and/or vigorous-intensity physical activity, low consumption of fat, processed foods, refined cereals, complex sugars, and the avoidance of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Results showed a protective effect on both pre- (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.84) and postmenopausal women (OR = O.20, 95% CI: 0.11-0.37) when highest versus lowest index quintiles were compared.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthy lifestyle was associated with a reduction in the odds of having breast cancer. Primary prevention of this disease should be promoted in an integrated manner. Effective strategies need to be identified to engage women in healthy lifestyles.

However, little is known about BC survivors' beliefs regarding the link between their behavior and recurrence risk. The objective of this study was to describe BC survivors' beliefs regarding performance of behaviors potentially associated with BC recurrence risk reduction, and to examine the link between these behaviors and BC recurrence risk reduction beliefs, worry, and risk perception.
METHODS: 200 female BC survivors (age, years: mean=57.7, standard deviation=9.2) completed a questionnaire assessing beliefs about the effectiveness of 14 potential BC recurrence risk reduction behaviors, their performance of these potential risk reduction behaviors, recurrence worry, and perception of personal lifetime BC recurrence risk.
RESULTS: The behaviors most frequently endorsed as potentially reducing BC recurrence risk included avoiding tobacco use (84%), exercising at least three times per week (74%), eating an average of five servings a day of fruits and vegetables (72%), and limiting food intake to maintain current weight or lose weight (70%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses predicting behavioral performance showed that beliefs were consistently associated with behavior while worry and risk perception were largely unrelated to behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: BC survivors' beliefs about the effectiveness of potential BC recurrence risk reduction behaviors are largely consistent with empirical findings and relate strongly to actual behavioral performance.

Understanding sleep disturbances in this period is important since early intervention has the potential to reduce the severity or chronicity of these problems. The present study sought to characterize sleep disturbances in this period, examine if they could be predicted by demographic, clinical, or lifestyle factors, and identify their relationship to fatigue, depression, and physical and mental well-being.
METHODS: Patients (N = 288) with breast cancer (32%), lung cancer (32%), or other cancers (36%) about to begin chemotherapy completed self-report measures assessing demographic and lifestyle characteristics, sleep, fatigue, depression, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of patients rated their sleep quality as fairly or very bad. Poorer overall sleep was significantly predicted by less education, more medical comorbidities, previous radiotherapy, less physical activity, and current tobacco use, but these variables accounted for only 7% of the variability in sleep disturbances. After controlling for significant relationships with depression and fatigue, sleep disturbances explained significant variability in physical well-being but not mental well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common before the start of chemotherapy and contribute to poorer physical well-being independent of fatigue and depression. Demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables had limited value in predicting sleep disturbances. However, depression and fatigue were highly correlated with sleep. Future research should seek to identify common etiological factors (e.g., cytokine production) and implement longitudinal designs to examine temporal relationships among these three symptoms in cancer patients.","2012",,"Support Care Cancer"," PURPOSE : Few studies of sleep disturbances in cancer patients have focused on the period before chemotherapy starts ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Data Collection, FALSE, Depression, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Educational Status, FALSE, Fatigue, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Life Style, TRUE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Quality of Life, TRUE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sleep Wake Disorders, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: 86 men with breast cancer were diagnosed in eight VA medical centers that agreed to collaborate on this project. A case-control analysis was conducted on a subset of the male breast cancer cases (n = 44) and age- and ethnicity-matched controls (n = 77). We compared host characteristics, comorbidities, and medications intake between cases and controls by using Chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: The descriptive analysis showed that the majority of veterans with male breast cancer were non-Hispanic white (60%), older than 65 years at diagnosis (56%), and more likely estrogen receptor positive (45%). World War II veterans represented the largest group (22%), followed by the Vietnam era veterans (10%). Thirty-three percent reported a positive family history of cancer, while 18% had another primary cancer diagnosis. Prior alcohol (43%) and tobacco use (56%) was substantial among these patients. Twenty percent of patients were overweight or obese and 55% had comorbid diseases with heart disease being the most prevalent, followed by diabetes mellitus. The case-control analysis yielded a significantly greater proportion of cases with gynecomastia (p < 0.0001), a positive family history of cancer (p = 0.0028), history of antibiotic use (p = 0.0112), and history of tobacco use (p = 0.0143) compared to controls.

,"21296855","Global cancer statistics.","Jemal A","The global burden of cancer continues to increase largely because of the aging and growth of the world population alongside an increasing adoption of cancer-causing behaviors, particularly smoking, in economically developing countries. Based on the GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates, about 12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56% of the cases and 64% of the deaths occurred in the economically developing world. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males, comprising 17% of the total new cancer cases and 23% of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries, a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11% of the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries, most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake. Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions globally.","2011",,"CA Cancer J Clin",,"other","Humans, FALSE, Internationality, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The levels of estrogen and progesterone appear to be important in the success of quit attempts and smoking cessation. In women smokers with the diagnosis or risk of breast cancer, the estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (TAM) is widely used, and even though the detrimental health effects of smoking are known, this vulnerable group has difficulty quitting and continues to smoke. The current study tested the effect of the estrogen receptor modulator TAM and the progesterone receptor antagonist mifepriston (RU486) on nicotine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in adult female rats. A three chambered CPP apparatus was used and nicotine was paired with the initially non-preferred chamber. Rats received nicotine or saline and hormone receptor modulators (vehicle, TAM, RU486) in a 2×3 experimental design. We have previously shown that nicotine induces CPP in male Sprague-Dawley rats but not in females. Our results show that while nicotine alone does not induce CPP in female rats, rats treated with TAM exhibit nicotine-induced CPP. Although RU486 has an aversive effect when applied alone, this is ameliorated by nicotine. These results confirm the role of ovarian hormone receptors in nicotine-induced CPP and may have clinical implications for developing more efficient smoking cessation approaches in women smokers.","2011",,"Brain Res Bull",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Conditioning, Psychological, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Female, FALSE, Hormone Antagonists, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mifepristone, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Nicotine, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Nicotinic Agonists, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Smoking Cessation, FALSE, Tamoxifen, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Tobacco Use Disorder, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Conversely, cigarette smoking also has antiestrogenic effects, which may reduce the risk of BC. The association between smoking and BC remains controversial.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 111 140 participants of the Nurses' Health Study from 1976 to 2006 for active smoking and 36 017 women from 1982 to 2006 for passive smoking.
RESULTS: During 3 005 863 person-years of follow-up, 8772 incident cases of invasive BC were reported. After adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio (HR) of BC was 1.06% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01%-1.10%) for ever smokers relative to never smokers. Breast cancer incidence was associated with a higher quantity of current (P for trend = .02) and past (P for trend = .003) smoking, younger age at smoking initiation (P for trend = .01), longer duration of smoking (P for trend = .01), and more pack-years of smoking (P for trend = .005). Premenopausal smoking was associated with a slightly higher incidence of BC (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.15 for every increase of 20 pack-years), especially smoking before first birth (1.18; 1.10-1.27 for every increase of 20 pack-years). Conversely, the direction of the association between postmenopausal smoking and BC was inverse (0.93; 0.85-1.02 for every increase of 20 pack-years).

Stroke recurs in approximately 25% of patients during the first five years post-stroke; recurrence may result in death, increased disability or institutionalisation. Modifiable risk factors for recurrent stroke have been identified, and may be addressed by means of behavioural health promotion interventions.Objectives This systematic review sought to establish the effectiveness of secondary prevention behavioural interventions, which address one or more modifiable lifestyle risk factors for recurrent stroke i.e. tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Types of participants The review included studies that had recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) who had had a stroke, minor stroke or transient ischaemic attack.Types of intervention The review considered studies that evaluated behavioural lifestyle interventions, designed to address the prevention of recurrent stroke.Types of outcomes Primary outcomes were concerned with lifestyle behaviour change i.e. tobacco use, diet, physical activity and alcohol consumption, and with change in physiological measures e.g. blood pressure, total cholesterol, and Body Mass Index. Secondary outcome measures included psychological outcomes, learning outcomes and incidence of stroke recurrence.Types of studies Experimental and non-experimental quantitative studies were considered.Search strategy In August 2009, we searched All EMB Reviews, AMED, ASSIA, British Nursing Index and Archive, CINAHL, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, ProQuest dissertation and theses, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and bibliographies of retrieved papers.Methodological quality and data extraction Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument, and extracted data using a review-specific data extraction form.Data analysis Where possible, results from the review papers were pooled in statistical meta-analysis using bespoke software based on the system used by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group. Where statistical pooling was not possible, findings are presented in narrative form.Results Three studies, two RCTs and one quasi-experimental study, involving 581 participants (baseline) were included in the review. Two models of service delivery were reported: shared care and nurse-led. Interventions were delivered to groups or in one-to-one consultations.Meta-analyses of the pooled lifestyle data favoured the interventions (2p=0.02; Note: here and throughout, 2p represents the two-tailed probability). In terms of physiological outcomes, the pooled data favoured the interventions (2p=0.05), particularly those aiming to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The pooled secondary outcomes, including perceived health status and stroke knowledge favoured the interventions (2p<0.00001), however, the test for heterogeneity was also highly significant.Conclusions Stroke secondary prevention lifestyle interventions are effective in terms of affecting positive change in relation to lifestyle behaviours, physiological and secondary outcomes. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of intervention on incidence of stroke recurrence.Implications for practice Clinicians should implement stroke secondary prevention interventions which address lifestyle behaviours, physiological factors, psychological outcomes and stroke knowledge.Implications for research Further large-scale, well-designed trials are needed to determine the factors that impact on the effectiveness of secondary prevention interventions.","2011",,"JBI Libr Syst Rev","05 ) , particularly those aiming to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels ","other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Three reviews of secondhand smoke (SHS) and breast cancer (2004-2006) each came to different conclusions. With 30 new studies since 2002, further review was deemed desirable. An Expert Panel was convened by four Canadian agencies, the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer to comprehensively examine the weight of evidence from epidemiological and toxicological studies and understanding of biological mechanisms regarding the relationship between tobacco smoke and breast cancer. This article summarises the panel's full report (http://www.otru.org/pdf/special/expert_panel_tobacco_breast_cancer.pdf). There are 20 known or suspected mammary carcinogens in tobacco smoke, and recognised biological mechanisms that explain how exposure to these carcinogens could lead to breast cancer. Results from the nine cohort studies reporting exposure metrics more detailed than ever/never and ex/current smoker show that early age of smoking commencement, higher pack-years and longer duration of smoking increase breast cancer risk 15% to 40%. Three meta-analyses report 35% to 50% increases in breast cancer risk for long-term smokers with N-acetyltransferase 2 gene (NAT2) slow acetylation genotypes. The active smoking evidence bolsters support for three meta-analyses that each reported about a 65% increase in premenopausal breast cancer risk among never smokers exposed to SHS.

We sought to determine the prevalence of tobacco use, alcohol use, and physical inactivity among cancer survivors overall and site-specific survivors.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2006-2008, and identified 1,670 survivors and 18,197 controls. Specific cancer sites included prostate, colorectal, female breast, and gynecologic (cervical, ovarian, uterine). Covariates included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, health insurance, and physical and mental health. Gender stratified logistic regression models associated survivorship with each health behavior.
RESULTS: 4.9% of men and 7.7% of women reported a cancer history. In adjusted regression models, male survivors were similar to gender matched controls, while female survivors had comparable tobacco and alcohol use but had more physical inactivity than controls (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8). By site, breast cancer survivors were more likely to be physically inactive (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and gynecologic cancer survivors were more likely to report current tobacco use (OR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8).

Although they use different sample preparation and sequencing technologies, they all rely on large computing capacity for assembling sequences and identifying somatic mutations against the background of genetic variations. Recent examples of NGS application to cancer genomes include the sequencing of 22 cases of glioblastoma multiforme that identified IDH1, the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, as target for cancer-driving mutations. Analysis of entire genomes of single samples of lung cancer and melanoma has brought unprecedented details on how tobacco carcinogens and UV exposure, respectively, may sculpt specific mutation landscapes. In breast cancer, comparative genome sequencing of primary and secondary lesions of a single patient has revealed clues on the phylogeny of tumor cells.
SUMMARY: NGS is opening a new era for understanding how environmental factors alter the human genome to generate cancerous cells, paving the way to a better understanding of the origins of human cancer.","2011",,"Curr Opin Oncol"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : This review describes recent advances in technologies for massive parallel sequencing of human genomes and discusses their application to the analysis of cancer genomes "," review","Genome, Human, FALSE, Genome-Wide Association Study, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Sequence Analysis, DNA, FALSE, methods, Q000379",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"21080951","Carcinogen metabolism, cigarette smoking, and breast cancer risk: a Bayes model averaging approach.","Stephenson N","BACKGROUND: Standard logistic regression with or without stepwise selection has the disadvantage of not incorporating model uncertainty and the dependency of estimates on the underlying model into the final inference. We explore the use of a Bayes Model Averaging approach as an alternative to analyze the influence of genetic variants, environmental effects and their interactions on disease.
METHODS: Logistic regression with and without stepwise selection and Bayes Model Averaging were applied to a population-based case-control study exploring the association of genetic variants in tobacco smoke-related carcinogen pathways with breast cancer.
RESULTS: Both regression and Bayes Model Averaging highlighted a significant effect of NAT1*10 on breast cancer, while regression analysis also suggested a significant effect for packyears and for the interaction of packyears and NAT2.
CONCLUSIONS: Bayes Model Averaging allows incorporation of model uncertainty, helps reduce dimensionality and avoids the problem of multiple comparisons. It can be used to incorporate biological information, such as pathway data, into the analysis. As with all Bayesian analysis methods, careful consideration must be given to prior specification.","2010",,"Epidemiol Perspect Innov",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Metabolic syndrome (MS)--characterized by central adiposity, insulin resistance, low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high serum triglyceride and high blood pressure--seems to be strictly correlated to breast carcinogenesis. We enrolled 777 healthy women and women with breast cancer in our nested case-control study to evaluate the association between MS and breast cancer, analyzing anthropometric parameters (weight, height, BMI, waist and hip circumference), blood pressure, serum HDL-C, triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, testosterone and uric acid levels and administering a questionnaire about physical activity, food intake, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, personal and familial history of disease. We found an higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (30%) in postmenopausal breast cancer patients compared to healthy women (19%). None of the individual MS features was strong enough to be considered responsible for breast carcinogenesis alone. However, of the 63 postmenopausal breast cancer cases associated to MS, 30% presented three or more MS features, suggesting that the activation of multiple molecular pathways underlying MS might contribute to tumorigenesis. Our data support the hypothesis that MS may be an indicator of breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. The unsettlement of the hormonal arrangement in postmenopausal, along with an increase in visceral adiposity, probably favour the hormone-dependent cell proliferation, which drives tumorigenesis. Adjustments in lifestyle with physical activity intensification and healthy diet could represent modifiable factors for the primary prevention of sporadic breast cancer.","2010",,"Cancer Biol Ther",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Alcoholism, FALSE, Blood Glucose, FALSE, analysis, Q000032, Blood Pressure, FALSE, Body Height, FALSE, Body Mass Index, FALSE, Body Size, FALSE, Body Weight, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cholesterol, HDL, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Insulin, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Life Style, FALSE, Metabolic Syndrome, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Middle Aged, FALSE, Motor Activity, FALSE, Postmenopause, TRUE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE, Testosterone, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Triglycerides, FALSE, blood, Q000097, Uric Acid, FALSE, blood, Q000097",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: Cancer incidence, mortality and burden of disease caused by the main cancer risk factors were calculated using comparative risk assessment methods and updated data on mortality and risks.
RESULTS: Lung cancer was the most common cancer in men and breast cancer the most common cancer in women, both in terms of incidence and mortality. The five leading behavioral and dietary risks--high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol use--were responsible for 24% of new cancer cases and 30% of cancer deaths. Cancers with the largest proportions attributable to preventable risk factors were cervical cancer (100%) and lung cancer (71%). Seventy percent of liver cancers and 60% of stomach cancers were due to infectious agents. A higher proportion of cancer deaths was attributed to infections in low- and middle-income than in high-income countries.

However, there was no direct evidence of an effect of tobacco carcinogens on the cellular molecules involved in breast tumorigenesis.
METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression of all of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits in 50 human breast cancer samples and to determine the expression of the alpha9-nAChR subunit in 276 surgical and laser capture microdissected breast tumor vs normal tissue pairs. Stable MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were established in which expression of the alpha9-nAChR subunit was inhibited using short interfering RNA. MCF-10A normal human breast epithelial cells were established in which the alpha9-nAChR subunit could be conditionally overexpressed by removal of doxycycline from the culture fluid. Cell proliferation and soft agar assays and tumor growth in nude mice were used as measures of cell transformation. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: In 186 (67.3%) of the 276 paired samples, alpha9-nAChR mRNA was expressed at (mean 7.84-fold) higher levels in breast cancers than in surrounding normal tissue. Stable expression of alpha9-nAChR short interfering RNA in MDA-MB-231 cells attenuated nicotine-stimulated proliferation and growth in soft agar and reduced tumor volume when the cells were introduced as xenografts in SCID mice (n = 5 mice per group; mean tumor volume at 6 weeks treatment in mice injected with Si alpha9 cells = 995.6 mm(3), in mice injected with parental cells = 2993.2 mm(3), difference = 1997.6 mm(3), 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1705 to 2290.2 mm(3), P = .009). Long-term treatment of MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells with either nicotine or its active metabolite, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, triggered precancerous transformation as defined by soft agar assay. Inducible overexpression of alpha9-nAChR in MCF-10A cell xenografts in nude mice substantially increased tumor growth (n = 5 mice per group; DOX+, mean tumor volume without nicotine vs with nicotine = 266.2 vs 501.6 mm(3), difference = 235.4 mm(3), 95% CI = 112.7 to 358 mm(3), P = .009; DOX-, mean tumor volume without nicotine vs with nicotine = 621.2 vs 898.6 mm(3), difference = 277.4 mm(3), 95% CI = 98.1 to 456.7 mm(3), P = .016; mean tumor volume in the presence of nicotine, DOX+ vs DOX- = 501.6 vs 898.6 mm(3), difference = 397 mm(3), 95% CI = 241.3 to 552.6 mm(3), P = .009).

There is an increasing incidence of breast cancer and eminent use of tobacco in females in this region. Thus, we analysed the role of tobacco exposure and polymorphisms in detoxification enzymes in breast cancer risk. Polymorphisms in five gene variants (GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, TP53 and CYP17) and four environmental exposure variables (tobacco smoking, tobacco chewing, betel quid chewing, alcohol) were analysed in 117 breast cancer cases and 174 cancer free controls. Multifactor dimensionality reduction identified betel quid chewing as the single main risk factor and women with betel quid chewing history had five times the risk of developing breast cancer [4.78 (2.87-8.00) 0.001]. In logistic regression analysis, GSTT1 null and GSTM1 null genotypes conferred 41% less [0.59 (0.34-1.03) 0.06] and 55% less [0.58 (0.30-1.02) 0.05] reduced risk to breast cancer, respectively. However, the risk increased in women with GSTP1 variant G allele which conferred 1.43 times [(0.96-2.11) 0.07] more risk to breast cancer.

Published reports have indicated that exposures to low dose radiation and tobacco smoke are factors that contribute to the development of breast cancer. However, there is a scarcity of information on the combinatorial effects of low dose radiation and tobacco smoke on formation and progression of breast cancer. The combination of these two genotoxic insults can induce significant damage to the genetic material of the cells resulting in neoplastic transformation.
METHODS: To study the effects of low dose ionizing radiation and tobacco smoke on breast cells, MCF 10A cells were treated either with radiation (Rad - 0.1 Gray) or cigarette smoke condensate (Csc - 10 microgram/ml of medium) or a combination of Rad + Csc. Following treatments, cells were analyzed for cell cycle distribution patterns and the ability to extrude the Hoechst 33342 dye. In addition, in vitro invasion and migration as well as mammosphere formation assays were performed. Finally, differential gene expression profiles were generated from the individual and combination treatment.
RESULTS: Exposure of MCF 10A cells to the combination of radiation plus cigarette smoke condensate generated a neoplastic phenotype. The transformed phenotype promoted increased mammosphere numbers, altered cell cycle phases with a doubling of the population in S phase, and increased invasion and motility. Also, exclusion of Hoechst 33342 dye, a surrogate marker for increased ABC transporters, was observed, which indicates a possible increase in drug resistance. In addition, changes in gene expression include the up regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in metabolic pathways and inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that when normal breast cells are exposed to low dose radiation in combination with cigarette smoke condensate a phenotype is generated that exhibits traits indicative of neoplastic transformation. More importantly, this is the first study to provide a new insight into a possible etiology for breast cancer formation in individuals exposed to low dose radiation and tobacco smoke.","2010",,"BMC Cancer",,"other","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Cell Cycle, FALSE, Cell Line, FALSE, Cell Movement, FALSE, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, TRUE, chemically induced, Q000139, DNA Damage, TRUE, Epithelial Cells, TRUE, drug effects, Q000187, Female, FALSE, Gamma Rays, TRUE, Gene Expression Profiling, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mammary Glands, Human, TRUE, drug effects, Q000187, Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Phenotype, FALSE, Smoke, TRUE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The goal of the present study was to identify early molecular changes in the lung induced by exposure to tobacco smoke and thus identify potential targets for chemoprevention. Female A/J mice were exposed to either tobacco smoke or HEPA-filtered air via a whole-body exposure chamber (6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 3, 8, and 20 weeks). Gene expression profiles of lung tissue from control and smoke-exposed animals were established using a 15K cDNA microarray. Cytochrome P450 1b1, a phase I enzyme involved in both the metabolism of xenobiotics and the 4-hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), was modulated to the greatest extent following smoke exposure. A panel of 10 genes were found to be differentially expressed in control and smoke-exposed lung tissues at 3, 8, and 20 weeks (P < 0.001). The interaction network of these differentially expressed genes revealed new pathways modulated by short-term smoke exposure, including estrogen metabolism. In addition, E(2) was detected within murine lung tissue by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry. Identification of the early molecular events that contribute to lung tumor formation is anticipated to lead to the development of promising targeted chemopreventive therapies. In conclusion, the presence of E(2) within lung tissue when combined with the modulation of cytochrome P450 1b1 and other estrogen metabolism genes by tobacco smoke provides novel insight into a possible role for estrogens in lung cancer.","2010",,"Cancer Prev Res (Phila)",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Atmosphere Exposure Chambers, FALSE, Biomarkers, FALSE, Cryptochromes, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1, FALSE, Enzyme Induction, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Estradiol, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Estrogens, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogens, Catechol, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Gene Expression Profiling, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Gene Regulatory Networks, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Humans, FALSE, Lung, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Inbred A, FALSE, Microsomes, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, FALSE, RNA, Messenger, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Random Allocation, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Time Factors, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

While used by the public, politicians, and the media, it is often discarded by clinicians and epidemiologists due to the heterogeneous mix of different cancers, risk factors and treatment modalities. We studied the trend in the Nordic 5-year relative survival and excess mortality for all cancers combined to see if the impact of case-mix and variations between countries in diagnostic methods such as breast screening and PSA testing could explain the lower survival in Denmark.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From the NORDCAN database 1964-2003, we defined two cohorts of cancer patients, one excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and another also excluding breast and prostate cancer. We estimated age-standardised incidence and mortality rates, 5-year relative survival, and excess mortality rates for varying follow-up periods, and age-specific 5-year relative survival by country, sex and 5-year diagnostic period.
RESULTS: Prostate cancer is the main driver of the incidence increase in men, as do breast cancer in women, whereas cancer mortality in all Nordic countries is declining. The 5-year relative survival ratios are increasing in each Nordic population, but less so in Denmark. Country differences in survival stem mainly from follow-up periods immediately after diagnosis. Adjusting for the case-mix of diagnoses diminished differences a little while exclusion of breast and prostate cancer reduced the gap between countries in survival and excess mortality more considerably, yet post-adjustment, Danish patients still fare worse during the first three months after diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Adjustment for case-mix and exclusion of sites where diagnostic procedures change the pattern of incidence is important when comparing overall cancer survival across countries, but the correction only explains part of the observed differences in survival.

Patients were included who had a known smoking history, and subdivided into any tobacco use 2683 (45%) or never tobacco use 3317 (55%). Analyses were performed to evaluate the association of smoking with clinical, pathologic and treatment-related factors at cancer presentation. Median age at diagnosis for all breast cancers was 55 years, for nonsmokers was 56 years, for any smoking history was 55 years, and the subgroup of current smokers was 52 years. The difference in median age for current smokers versus nonsmokers was statistically significant (p < 0.0001).

European patients have generally high 5-year relative survival ratios, and the Nordic countries, except for Denmark, have ratios among the highest.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on the NORDCAN database we present trends in age-standardised incidence and mortality rates of invasive breast cancer in the Nordic countries, alongside 5- and 10-year relative survival for the period of diagnosis 1964-2003 followed up to the end of 2006. Excess mortality rates are also provided for varying follow-up intervals after diagnosis. The analysis is confined to invasive breast cancer in Nordic women.
RESULTS: Incidence increased rapidly in all five countries, whereas mortality remained almost unchanged. Both incidence and mortality rates were highest in Denmark. Between 1964 and 2003 both 5- and 10-year relative survival increased by 20-30 percentage points in all countries, and 10-year survival remained around 10 percentage points lower than 5-year survival. Relative survival was lowest in Denmark throughout the period, with a 5-year survival of 79% for years 1999-2003, but 83-87% in the other countries. From 1964 the youngest women had the highest survival ratios up until the introduction of screening, when a shift occurred towards higher survival among age groups 50-59 and 60-69 in each country, except for Denmark. Excess death rates during the first months after diagnosis were highest in Denmark.
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survival is high and rising in the Nordic countries, and probably relates to the early implementation of organised mammography screening in each country except Denmark and a high and relatively uniform standard of living, diagnosis and treatment. Denmark stands out with higher mortality and poorer survival.

We estimated the current burden of cancer in Britain attributable to past occupational exposures for International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) group 1 (established) and 2A (probable) carcinogens.
METHODS: We calculated attributable fractions and numbers for cancer mortality and incidence using risk estimates from the literature and national data sources to estimate proportions exposed.
RESULTS: 5.3% (8019) cancer deaths were attributable to occupation in 2005 (men, 8.2% (6362); women, 2.3% (1657)). Attributable incidence estimates are 13 679 (4.0%) cancer registrations (men, 10 063 (5.7%); women, 3616 (2.2%)). Occupational attributable fractions are over 2% for mesothelioma, sinonasal, lung, nasopharynx, breast, non-melanoma skin cancer, bladder, oesophagus, soft tissue sarcoma, larynx and stomach cancers. Asbestos, shift work, mineral oils, solar radiation, silica, diesel engine exhaust, coal tars and pitches, occupation as a painter or welder, dioxins, environmental tobacco smoke, radon, tetrachloroethylene, arsenic and strong inorganic mists each contribute 100 or more registrations. Industries and occupations with high cancer registrations include construction, metal working, personal and household services, mining, land transport, printing/publishing, retail/hotels/restaurants, public administration/defence, farming and several manufacturing sectors. 56% of cancer registrations in men are attributable to work in the construction industry (mainly mesotheliomas, lung, stomach, bladder and non-melanoma skin cancers) and 54% of cancer registrations in women are attributable to shift work (breast cancer).
CONCLUSION: This project is the first to quantify in detail the burden of cancer and mortality due to occupation specifically for Britain. It highlights the impact of occupational exposures, together with the occupational circumstances and industrial areas where exposures to carcinogenic agents occurred in the past, on population cancer morbidity and mortality; this can be compared with the impact of other causes of cancer. Risk reduction strategies should focus on those workplaces where such exposures are still occurring.","2010",,"Br J Cancer",,"other","Agricultural Workers' Diseases, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Asbestos, FALSE, Carcinogens, FALSE, Coal Tar, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Industry, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mesothelioma, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Occupational Diseases, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Occupational Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Occupations, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, United Kingdom, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

To determine how to communicate information about this modifiable breast cancer risk to young women, we analyzed a selection of 32 recent English-language breast cancer messages and campaigns that targeted young women. In addition, we obtained young women's responses to three breast cancer campaign images during focus group discussions. A visual analysis of messages points to an explicitly gendered discourse within contemporary campaigns, one that entails conflicting messages regarding breast cancer, health, feminine beauty, and risk. Although the intent might be to educate and empower young women to ""fight"" against breast cancer, paradoxically, the messages employ imagery that sexually objectifies young women's breasts and bodies. Recommendations are made for messaging about tobacco and breast cancer risk to avoid reproducing one-dimensional or stereotypical presentations of gender and femininity.","2010",,"Qual Health Res",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Awareness, FALSE, Beauty, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Gender Identity, FALSE, Health Promotion, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Humans, FALSE, Mass Media, FALSE, Sexuality, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We observed that the female Turkish cancer patients frequently gain weight with adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and planned to examine the magnitude of this problem in early breast cancer patients treated at our hospital. A total of 176 early breast cancer patients who received their adjuvant systemic therapy in Marmara University Hospital between 2003 and 2007 are included in the study. We recorded their weight before and after chemotherapy and also a year after chemotherapy to find out whether the change with weight is transitory. We have also recorded demographic information, including the educational level, menopausal status, the type of chemotherapy or hormonal treatment administered stage of disease, marital status, occupation and the underlying diseases to analyze the relationship between change in weight and these parameters. Median age of patients was 53 and 72% of patients were postmenopausal. Educational level was equally distributed for primary education (27%), high school (40%), and university (33%). The majority of the patients (76%) was married, had two children (69%) and was housewife (60%). Family history of any cancer was high (32%). Most of the patients had stage II cancer (56%), received anthracyclines+/- taxane based chemotherapy (98%) and had no underlying disease (68%). The majority also did not smoke (73%) or drink alcohol (93%). A total of 67% and 72% patients gained weight upon completion and one year after completion of chemotherapy. Mean weight before the chemotherapy, upon completion of chemotherapy and one year after completion of chemotherapy were 68.9 kg, 70.6 kg (P = 0.000) and 71.9 kg (P = 0.000) respectively. Mean body mass index was 27.1 at baseline, 27.8 upon completion of chemotherapy (P = 0.000) and 28.3 one year after completion of chemotherapy (P = 0.000). Age, menopausal status, multiparity and presence of comorbid diseases had statistically significant impact on weight gain following adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients (P = 0.000, P = 0.008, P = 0.015 and P = 0.017 respectively). This study shows that Turkish women with early breast cancer gain weight after adjuvant systemic therapy, in line with European and American counterparts. This increase in weight is maintained at least one year after adjuvant therapy. Given the adverse consequences of weight gain in terms of both breast cancer prognosis and general health, it is necessary to inform patients about this change and to develop strategies for weight maintenance during and after systemic therapy.","2011",,"Med Oncol",,"other","Antineoplastic Agents, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Body Mass Index, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Chemotherapy, Adjuvant, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasm Staging, FALSE, Retrospective Studies, FALSE, Turkey, FALSE, Weight Gain, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

It affects multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recently, cadmium has been shown to function as an endocrine disruptor, to stimulate estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) activity and promote uterine and mammary gland growth in mice. Although cadmium exposure has been associated with the development of breast cancer, the mechanism of action of cadmium remains unclear. To address this deficit, we examined the effects of cadmium treatment on breast cancer cells. We found that ERalpha is required for both cadmium-induced cell growth and modulation of gene expression. We also determined that ERalpha translocates to the nucleus in response to cadmium exposure. Additionally, we provide evidence that cadmium potentiates the interaction between ERalpha and c-Jun and enhances recruitment of this transcription factor complex to the proximal promoters of cyclin D1 and c-myc, thus increasing their expression. This study provides a mechanistic link between cadmium exposure and ERalpha and demonstrates that cadmium plays an important role in the promotion of breast cancer.","2010",,"Mol Endocrinol",,"other","Blotting, Western, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Cadmium, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, FALSE, Cyclin D1, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogen Receptor alpha, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Immunoprecipitation, FALSE, Protein Binding, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Utilizing whole-genome tiling arrays, we analyzed the transcription across the entire genome in both normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and NHBE cells exposed to the tobacco carcinogen NNK. Our efforts focused on the characterization of non-coding transcripts that were greater than 300 nucleotides in length and whose expression was increased in response to NNK. We identified 12 Long Stress-Induced Non-coding Transcripts that we term LSINCTs. Northern blot analysis revealed that these transcripts were larger than predicted from the tiling array data. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR performed across a panel of normal cell lines indicates that these transcripts are more abundantly expressed in rapidly growing tissues or in tissues that are more prone to cellular stress. These transcripts that have increased expression after exposure to NNK also had increased expression in a number of lung cancer cell lines and also in many breast cancer cell lines. Collectively, our results identified a new class of long stress responsive non-coding transcripts, LSINCTs, which have increased expression in response to DNA damage induced by NNK. LSINCTs interestingly also have increased expression in a number of cancer-derived cell lines, indicating that the expression is increased in both, correlating cellular stress and cancer.","2010",,"Genomics",,"other","Base Sequence, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, Carcinogens, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Cell Line, FALSE, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, TRUE, drug effects, Q000187, Genome, Human, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, Molecular Sequence Data, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Nitrosamines, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, RNA, Untranslated, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Stress, Physiological, FALSE, Transcription, Genetic, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Deficiencies in DNA repair capacity have been associated with cancer risk. The mutagen sensitivity assay (MSA), a phenotypic marker of DNA damage response and repair capacity, has been consistently shown to associate with the risk of tobacco-related cancers.
METHODS: In a case-control study of 164 women with breast cancer and 165 women without the disease, we investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and risk of breast cancer using bleomycin as the mutagen.
RESULTS: High bleomycin sensitivity (>0.65 breaks per cell) was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7-4.5]. Risk increased with greater number of bleomycin-induced chromosomal breaks (P(trend) = 0.01). The association between bleomycin sensitivity and breast cancer risk was greater for women who were black, premenopausal and ever smokers. Our data also suggest that bleomycin sensitivity may modulate the effect of tobacco smoking on breast cancer risk. Among women with hypersensitivity to bleomycin, ever smokers had a 1.6-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95% CI = 0.6-3.9, P for interaction between tobacco smoking and bleomycin sensitivity = 0.32).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased bleomycin sensitivity is significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women.

The study findings show young women's interest in this risk factor for breast cancer. Three themes were drawn from the analysis: making sense of the information on smoking and breast cancer, personal susceptibility and tobacco exposure and suggestions for increasing awareness about tobacco exposure and breast cancer. There was general consensus on framing public awareness messages about this risk factor on 'protecting others' from breast cancer to catch smokers' attention, providing young women with the facts and personal stories of breast cancer to help establish a personal connection with this information and overcome desensitization related to tobacco messages, and targeting all smokers who may place young women at risk.

According to an INSERM report in 1999, one Frenchwoman in three will die from a cardiovascular disease, while only one in 25 will die of breast cancer. For new generations of women, the protective effect of the estrogen burden may be counterbalanced by the increasing prevalence during the perimenopausal period of metabolic syndrome, particularly harmful in terms of cardiovascular risk. Before oral contraceptives are prescribed, an extremely thorough history must be taken. These should in no case be prescribed for smokers older than 35 years, regardless of how little they smoke. Neither uncomplicated diabetes nor controlled dyslipidemia is a contraindication to hormonal contraception for women. It now seems clear that hormone therapy of menopause does not prevent cardiovascular disease. Nor, however, does it increase the risk if it is administered early, that is, during the first five years of menopause, and accompanied by close monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors and annual reassessment of the benefit-risk balance. The old cliché remains true: the patient at high risk of cardiovascular disease is a man older than 50 years, who smokes and is obese. But men still die more often from cancer than from cardiovascular disease, while the latter is the leading of cause in women, especially after menopause. The symptoms are often misleading and diagnosis is thus frequently delayed. Smoking, lack of exercise, overweight, and stress are all risk factors in women of all ages, and exposure to them can increase as women grow older. These factors should alert the physician and induce earlier screening for cardiovascular disease. In practice, too many women and their physicians underestimate their real risk of cardiovascular accident.

Intramural hematomas and atheromatous ulcers of the aorta, albeit rare, affect as many women as men and have variable outcomes: some are resolved with heparin treatment, and others are fatal. Atherosclerotic stenoses and occlusions limited to the level of the aortoiliac bifurcation are increasingly prevalent and difficult to treat in young women, in part because of their addiction to smoking. After being more or less ignored for a long time, the particularity of atheromatous abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in women is now being recognized. AAA in women are less frequent than in men, but grow faster and have a higher risk of rupture; moreover, cardiovascular disease is generally detected and managed less often in women. Overall mortality from AAA in women is similar to that of breast cancer. The two major risk factors for AAA are, as in men, a direct family history of AAA and smoking. The diagnostic standards for AAA, the criteria for defining progression, and the indications for surgery are probably not the same as in men, and the smaller initial caliber of women's aortas must be taken into account. Most guidelines today recommend ultrasound screening for AAA for women older than 50 years with a family history (in a 1(st)degree relative), women aged 60-75 years who are hypertensive or smoke, and smokers older than 75 years without serious comorbidity and with a life expectancy essentially normal for their age. Monitoring patients with a small AAA (anteroposterior diameter < 40-45 mm) must not be limited only to the aneurysm, but must also include comprehensive management to eliminate modifiable risk factors and thus to reduce cardiovascular and surgical risk (by better preparing the patient for this possibility) as well as to slow the progression of the aneurysm and decrease the risk of its rupture.","2010",,"Presse Med",,"other","Aged, FALSE, Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Aortic Rupture, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mass Screening, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Patient Selection, FALSE, Practice Guidelines as Topic, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Risk Reduction Behavior, FALSE, Sex Characteristics, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Treatment Outcome, FALSE, Women's Health, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Acetylation status was assessed as slow or fast. Therefore, NAT2 haplotypes were estimated using genotype information from six NAT2 polymorphisms. Most probable haplotypes served as alleles for the deduction of NAT2 acetylation status.

Since 1998, lung cancer deaths in women have surpassed those caused by breast cancer in the United States. Annual lung cancer deaths among US women currently surpass those caused by breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers combined. Women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the lung compared to squamous cell carcinoma, and never-smokers diagnosed with lung cancer are almost three times more likely to be female than male. These observations in the population, coupled to the findings that both estrogen receptors (ERs) and aromatase, the enzyme that synthesizes 17beta-estradiol, are expressed by lung tumors, suggest a role for female steroid hormones in control of lung cancer growth. Preclinical data and clinical data are increasingly emerging to support this concept, and to suggest that a local production of estrogen and expression of ERs occurs in lung tumors that arise in men as well as in women.

This risk association was explored in a large prospective study of women, the California Teachers Study.
METHODS: Detailed lifetime information on passive smoke exposure by setting (home, work, or social) and by age of exposure was collected in 1997 from 57,523 women who were lifetime nonsmokers and had no history of breast cancer. In the ensuing decade, a total of 1,754 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) associated with several lifetime passive smoke exposure metrics.
RESULTS: For all breast cancer, measures of higher lifetime passive smoking intensity and duration were associated with nonstatistically significant HRs of 1.11 to 1.14. For postmenopausal women, HRs for lifetime low, medium, and high cumulative exposure were 1.17 (95% CI, 0.91-1.49), 1.19 (95% CI, 0.93-1.53), and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.99-1.60). For women exposed in adulthood (age > or =20 years), risk was elevated at the highest level of cumulative exposure (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), primarily among postmenopausal women (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.56). A statistically significant dose response was detected when analysis was restricted to women with moderate to high levels of passive smoke exposure.

Total cancer mortality trends were favourable, though to a variable degree, in all major European countries, including Russia, but not in Romania. The major determinants of these favourable trends were the decline of lung (-16%) and other tobacco-related cancers in men, together with the persistent falls in gastric cancer, and the recent appreciable falls in colorectal cancer. In women, relevant contributions came from the persistent decline in cervical cancer and the recent falls in breast cancer mortality, particularly in northern and western Europe.

,"19925375","Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.","Pukkala E","We present up to 45 years of cancer incidence data by occupational category for the Nordic populations. The study covers the 15 million people aged 30-64 years in the 1960, 1970, 1980/1981 and/or 1990 censuses in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and the 2.8 million incident cancer cases diagnosed in these people in a follow-up until about 2005. The study was undertaken as a cohort study with linkage of individual records based on the personal identity codes used in all the Nordic countries. In the censuses, information on occupation for each person was provided through free text in self-administered questionnaires. The data were centrally coded and computerised in the statistical offices. For the present study, the original occupational codes were reclassified into 53 occupational categories and one group of economically inactive persons. All Nordic countries have a nation-wide registration of incident cancer cases during the entire study period. For the present study the incident cancer cases were classified into 49 primary diagnostic categories. Some categories have been further divided according to sub-site or morphological type. The observed number of cancer cases in each group of persons defined by country, sex, age, period and occupation was compared with the expected number calculated from the stratum specific person years and the incidence rates for the national population. The result was presented as a standardised incidence ratio, SIR, defined as the observed number of cases divided by the expected number. For all cancers combined (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), the study showed a wide variation among men from an SIR of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.95) in domestic assistants to 1.48 (1.43-1.54) in waiters. The occupations with the highest SIRs also included workers producing beverage and tobacco, seamen and chimney sweeps. Among women, the SIRs varied from 0.58 (0.37-0.87) in seafarers to 1.27 (1.19-1.35) in tobacco workers. Low SIRs were found for farmers, gardeners and teachers. Our study was able to repeat most of the confirmed associations between occupations and cancers. It is known that almost all mesotheliomas are associated with asbestos exposure. Accordingly, plumbers, seamen and mechanics were the occupations with the highest risk in the present study. Mesothelioma was the cancer type showing the largest relative differences between the occupations. Outdoor workers such as fishermen, gardeners and farmers had the highest risk of lip cancer, while the lowest risk was found among indoor workers such as physicians and artistic workers. Studies of nasal cancer have shown increased risks associated with exposure to wood dust, both for those in furniture making and for those exposed exclusively to soft wood like the majority of Nordic woodworkers. We observed an SIR of 1.84 (1.66-2.04) in male and 1.88 (0.90-3.46) in female woodworkers. For nasal adenocarcinoma, the SIR in males was as high as 5.50 (4.60-6.56). Male waiters and tobacco workers had the highest risk of lung cancer, probably attributable to active and passive smoking. Miners and quarry workers also had a high risk, which might be related to their exposure to silica dust and radon daughters. Among women, tobacco workers and engine operators had a more than fourfold risk as compared with the lung cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and teachers. The occupational risk patterns were quite similar in all main histological subtypes of lung cancer. Bladder cancer is considered as one of the cancer types most likely to be related to occupational carcinogens. Waiters had the highest risk of bladder cancer in men and tobacco workers in women, and the low-risk categories were the same ones as for lung cancer. All this can be accounted for by smoking. The second-highest SIRs were among chimney sweeps and hairdressers. Chimney sweeps are exposed to carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the chimney soot, and hairdressers' work environment is also rich in chemical agents. Exposure to the known hepatocarcinogens, the Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin, is rare in the Nordic countries, and a large proportion of primary liver cancers can therefore be attributed to alcohol consumption. The highest risks of liver cancer were seen in occupational categories with easy access to alcohol at the work place or with cultural traditions of high alcohol consumption, such as waiters, cooks, beverage workers, journalists and seamen. The risk of colon cancer has been related to sedentary work. The findings in the present study did not strongly indicate any protective role of physical activity. Colon cancer was one of the cancer types showing the smallest relative variation in incidence between occupational categories. The occupational variation in the risk of female breast cancer (the most common cancer type in the present series, 373 361 cases) was larger, and there was a tendency of physically demanding occupations to show SIRs below unity. Women in occupations which require a high level of education have, on average, a higher age at first child-birth and elevated breast cancer incidence. Women in occupational categories with the highest average number of children had markedly lower incidence. In male breast cancer (2 336 cases), which is not affected by the dominating reproductive factors, there was a suggestion of an increase in risk in occupations characterised by shift work. Night-shift work was recently classified as probably carcinogenic, with human evidence based on breast cancer research. The most common cancer among men in the present cohort was prostate cancer (339 973 cases). Despite the huge number of cases, we were unable to demonstrate any occupation-related risks. The observed small occupational variation could be easily explained by varying PSA test frequency. The Nordic countries are known for equity and free and equal access to health care for all citizens. The present study shows that the risk of cancer, even under these circumstances, is highly dependent on the person's position in the society. Direct occupational hazards seem to explain only a small percentage of the observed variation - but still a large number of cases - while indirect factors such as life style changes related to longer education and decreasing physical activity become more important. This publication is the first one from the extensive Nordic Occupational Cancer (NOCCA) project. Subsequent studies will focus on associations between specific work-related factors and cancer diseases with the aim to identify exposure-response patterns. In addition to the cancer data demonstrated in the present publication, the NOCCA project produced Nordic Job Exposure Matrix (described in separate articles in this issue of Acta Oncologica) that transforms information about occupational title histories to quantitative estimates of specific exposures. The third essential component is methodological development related to analysis and interpretation of results based on averaged information of exposures and co-factors in the occupational categories.","2009",,"Acta Oncol"," Subsequent studies will focus on associations between specific work-related factors and cancer diseases with the aim to identify exposure-response patterns ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Occupational Diseases, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Occupational Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Occupations, FALSE, Prognosis, FALSE, Scandinavian and Nordic Countries, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

As of yet, however, there is no direct evidence of antitumor effects by agents that block the effect of tobacco compound nicotine (Nic) on relevant nicotinic receptors (nAChR) involved in breast tumorigenesis. In the present study, the expression profiles of different nAChR subunits in the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) were characterized by RT-PCR. Nic (>0.1 microM, 6 h) significantly increased alpha9-nAChR mRNA and protein expression levels in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). On the other hand, combined treatment with luteolin (Lut, 0.5 microM) and quercetin (Que, 0.5 microM) profoundly decreased MDA-MB-231 proliferation by down-regulating alpha9-nAChR expression. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in soft agar to evaluate anchorage-independent colony formation; combined treatment of Lut+Que inhibited Nic-induced MDA-MB-231 colony formation. Interestingly, the number of colonies formed was profoundly reduced in alpha9-nAChR knockdown (Si alpha9) cells in the combined (Lut+Que)-treated group as compared to the relevant control groups. Such results show that Lut- or Que-induced antitransforming activities were not limited to specific inhibition of the alpha9-nAChR receptor. Both alpha5- and alpha9-nAChR appear to be important molecular targets for Lut- and Que-induced antitumor effects in human breast cancer cells.","2010",,"J Agric Food Chem",,"other","Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Cell Proliferation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Down-Regulation, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Female, FALSE, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Humans, FALSE, Luteolin, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Nicotine, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Protein Isoforms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Quercetin, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Receptors, Nicotinic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"19915951","Active, but not passive cigarette smoking was inversely associated with mammographic density.","Butler LM","PURPOSE: The opposing carcinogenic and antiestrogenic properties of tobacco smoke may explain why epidemiologic studies have not consistently reported positive associations for active smoking and breast cancer risk. A negative relation between mammographic density, a strong breast cancer risk factor, and active smoking would lend support for an antiestrogenic mechanism.
METHODS: We used multivariable linear regression to assess the associations of active smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure with mammographic density in 799 pre- and early perimenopausal women in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN).
RESULTS: We observed that current active smoking was associated with 7.2% lower mammographic density, compared to never active smoking and no SHS exposure (p = 0.02). Starting to smoke before 18 years of age and having smoked > or =20 cigarettes/day were also associated with statistically significantly lower percent densities. Among nulliparous women having smoked > or =20 cigarettes/day was associated with 23.8% lower density, compared to having smoked < or = 9 cigarettes/day (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that tobacco smoke exerts an antiestrogenic effect on breast tissue, but counters the known increased risk of breast cancer with smoking prior to first full-term birth. Thus, our data suggest that the antiestrogenic but not the carcinogenic effects of smoking may be reflected by breast density.","2010",,"Cancer Causes Control"," PURPOSE : The opposing carcinogenic and antiestrogenic properties of tobacco smoke may explain why epidemiologic studies have not consistently reported positive associations for active smoking and breast cancer risk ","other","Adult, FALSE, Black or African American, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Asian People, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Breast, FALSE, pathology, Q000473, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnosis, Q000175, Estrogen Antagonists, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Linear Models, FALSE, Mammography, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Middle Aged, FALSE, Multivariate Analysis, FALSE, Parity, FALSE, Pregnancy, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, White People, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Women's Health, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"19913184","Survivorship: adult cancer survivors.","Ganz PA","During the next decade, a rapid increase in the number of new cancer diagnoses in the population as well as a growing number of cancer survivors can be expected. Cancer is anticipated to exceed cardiovascular disease as the primary cause of mortality in the United States population. Despite efforts in tobacco control, the aging of the population and obesity epidemic will contribute toward the increasing incidence of cancer. Although oncology specialists will continue to play a critical role in the diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with cancer, primary care providers will need to play an expanding role in the early detection of cancer, as well as the follow-up, health promotion, and cancer surveillance that will be necessary after initial cancer treatment. Oncology specialists will need to do a better job coordinating the care of their patients with primary care providers, and work toward a shared care model that will optimize the quality of care delivered by the health care system. Cancer treatment summaries and survivorship care plans are an initial attempt to address the current fragmentation and lack of coordination in care that exist today. Cancer survivors are at risk for a wide range of late effects after their primary cancer treatment. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the exact incidence and prevalence of many physical late effects. For example, how many women given standard adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer at age 35 years will develop permanent amenorrhea after treatment, and be infertile? What is the excess risk of osteoporosis in a 70-year-old man receiving endocrine therapy for prostate cancer? What is the risk of coronary artery disease after mantle irradiation for Hodgkin lymphoma? Because of the limited database for many of these sequelae of treatment, clinicians have to keep all of these potential risks in mind as they interview a survivor, and develop a long-term management plan that focuses on symptomatic management and future chronic disease prevention. Until one has a better sense of the natural history of these late sequelae, as well as better information about who is at risk, focusing on a taking a cancer survivor-directed medical history may be the best detection tool that is available. Drawing on a shared care model, primary care providers should collaborate with oncology specialists to determine if cancer-specific laboratory and radiographic studies are indicated to determine if the patient has a cancer treatment-related late effect or cancer recurrence. Health promotion and aggressive management of comorbid conditions should be a standard of care for cancer survivors, as with other patients in the primary care practice. With the growing number of cancer survivors, as well as the recommendations of the IOM report directing research and policy on this subject (see Box 1), it is hoped that in the future a better evidence base to direct health care management in cancer survivors will be built up.","2009",,"Prim Care",," review","Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Delivery of Health Care, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Female, FALSE, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, FALSE, Health Promotion, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Models, Organizational, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Patient Education as Topic, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Physician-Patient Relations, FALSE, Practice Patterns, Physicians', FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Primary Health Care, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Quality Assurance, Health Care, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Survivors, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, United States, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"19806273","Cancer incidence among large cohort of female Danish registered nurses.","Kjaer TK","BACKGROUND: Nurses are potentially exposed to carcinogens in their working environment. We investigated the risks for 21 types of cancers in Danish nurses.
METHODS: We identified 92 140 female nurses from the computerized files of the Danish Nurses' Association. By record linkage, we reconstructed information on employment since 1964 using data from a national pension fund; information on vital status and reproduction was obtained from the Central Population Register. Each woman was followed-up from 1980-2003 in the Danish Cancer Registry. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Using Poisson regression models, we made internal comparisons in subgroups of nurses, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: We documented 8410 cancers during follow-up and found significantly increased SIR for breast cancer (SIR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.2), cancers of the brain and nervous system (SIR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3), melanoma (SIR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3), and other skin cancers (SIR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.2). Significantly decreased risks were observed for alcohol- and tobacco-related cancers. Nurses who were accredited by the Association after 1981 had significantly increased risks for thyroid cancer (SIR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.5) and cancers of the brain and nervous system (SIR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9). Former nurses had significantly increased SIR for all cancers combined and breast cancer the first ten years after leaving the profession. In a Poisson regression analysis of breast cancer and duration of employment in hospitals, adjusted for reproductive factors, nurses had an increase risk the first 25 years of employment, but not for longer periods.
CONCLUSION: The increased risk of breast cancer and the decreased risk of alcohol- and tobacco-related cancers support the findings of most other studies on nurses. The elevated risks for cancers of the breast, brain, nervous system, and thyroid warrant further study.","2009",,"Scand J Work Environ Health"," We investigated the risks for 21 types of cancers in Danish nurses ","other","Adult, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Denmark, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Melanoma, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Nurses, TRUE, Occupational Exposure, FALSE, Skin Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Thyroid Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Young Adult, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) catalyzes arylamine carcinogen biotransformation and NAT2 genetic polymorphisms may contribute to differential susceptibility to breast cancer. We tested whether NAT2 modified the association between cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk in a population-based study of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women in the Southwest United States. Data were available for cigarette smoking and NAT2 polymorphisms for 717 cases (Hispanic, 251 and non-Hispanic white, 466) and 735 controls (Hispanic, 245 and non-Hispanic white, 490). NAT2 genotypes were translated into rapid, intermediate, slow, or very slow acetylator phenotypes. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the joint association of NAT2 with smoking on breast cancer risk were estimated using logistic regression. Non-Hispanic white women were more likely (p < 0.001) than Hispanic women to have a slow (41.7 vs. 33.5%) or very slow (19.0 vs. 11.1%) acetylator status and less likely to have rapid/intermediate phenotypes (39.2 vs. 54.4%). Breast cancer risk was significantly increased in non-Hispanic white women with a very slow acetylator phenotype who smoked: ever versus never (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.49-4.41), never versus former (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.41-5.17) or current (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.07-5.65), and 16 + pack-years (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.16-4.51).

METHODS: Incident breast cancer cases were identified in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry and population controls were sampled from state Medicare lists and driver's license rosters. Demographic, lifestyle, medical history, reproductive history, and passive and active smoking exposure variables were assessed by telephone interview. We defined passive and active tobacco smoke exposure categories reflective of lifetime exposure patterns, and compared breast cancer risk among these groups while adjusting for age, body mass index, menopausal status, parity, alcohol consumption, and family history of breast cancer. We also adjusted passive smoking associations for active smoking status and vice versa.
RESULTS: We observed no association between ever being passively exposed to tobacco smoke and risk of incident breast cancer (adjusted OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.8, 1.8) nor between active smoking and breast cancer (adjusted OR for [23 pack-years compared to nonsmokers: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.7, 1.3).

Rates of cancer seem to be lower than those in neighbouring countries, with the leading causes of death being lung cancer in Palestinian men and breast cancer in women. The response of society and the health-care system to this epidemic is inadequate. A large proportion of health-care expenditure is on expensive curative care outside the area.

METHODS: We reviewed 13 women's magazines published in the United States from 1987-2003 using the search terms breast cancer, lung cancer, smoking, and tobacco. We reviewed the abstracts or entire articles to determine relevance.
RESULTS: A total of 1044 articles addressed breast cancer, lung cancer, or tobacco use: 681 articles related to breast cancer, 47 related to lung cancer, and 316 related to tobacco use. The greater number of breast cancer articles compared to lung cancer articles was statistically significant (P value < .0001). The greater number of breast cancer articles compared to lung cancer articles combined with tobacco use articles was also statistically significant (P = .0012). The annual number breast cancer articles compared to the breast cancer mortality rate demonstrated a negative relationship.

The results from cytogenetic analysis showed that Br-Nos induced polyploidy and telomeric association in MCF10A-CSC3 cells, while MCF10A cells remained unaffected. Our immunofluorescence data further demonstrated that MCF10A-CSC3 cells were susceptible to mitotic catastrophe on exposure to Br-Nos and failed to recover after drug withdrawal. MCF10A-CSC3 cells exhibited Br-Nos-induced aberrant multipolar spindle formation, which irreversibly impaired the alignment of replicated chromosome to the equatorial plane and finally culminated in cell death. Although MCF10A cells upon Br-Nos treatment showed bipolar spindles with some uncongressed chromosomes, these cells recovered fairly well after drug withdrawal. Our flow-cytometry analysis data reconfirmed that MCF10A-CSC3 cells were more susceptible to cell death compared to MCF10A cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that decreased levels of cdc2/cyclin B1 and cdc2 kinase activity are responsible for Br-Nos-induced mitotic cell arrest leading to cell death in MCF10A-CSC3 cells.

Identification of a lung nodule in a patient with known breast cancer poses a challenging diagnostic problem. This study outlines the management of such patients and identifies factors that correlate with survival.
METHODS: From 1977 through 2002, 35 patients with known breast cancer were identified with an additional primary lung cancer. Data were collected from a retrospective chart review. Median and 2- year survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis identified independent predictors of survival.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients (54%) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and had their lung cancer discovered during workup and/or follow-up of their breast cancer. The diagnosis of lung cancer was made by preoperative biopsy in 23 patients (82%). Nineteen patients (54%) were successfully treated with surgery. Mean follow-up was 2.3 years. Median survival for all patients was 1.8 years. Factors associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival included asymptomatic presentation of lung cancer (P = 0.003), absence of tobacco use (P = 0.021), and stage I lung cancer (P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis revealed that tobacco use (RR = 3.6, P = 0.047) and advanced stage of lung cancer (II-IV) at the time of diagnosis (RR = 2.2, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of decreased survival.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-one prospectively recorded patients (pts), treated in Radiotherapy Department for Breast Cancer (BC) with radiotherapy (RT) to the whole breast at the dose of 42.9Gy per 13 fractions (F) per 5 weeks have been studied. Skin reactions were monitored weekly using the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria scoring system, version 3. All risk factors as tobacco smoking, diabetes, obesity were also recorded.
RESULTS: All 81 pts, aged from 40 to 83 years (median: 70 years) received whole breast RT 42.9Gy per 13 F without lymph node irradiation after breast conserving surgery. There were no pts with concurrent chemo- and/or hormonal therapy. Seventeen patients (21%) have been treated using decubitus dorsal (DD) technique and 64 (79%) using the previously described isocentric decubitus lateral (IDL) technique. During the RT, only 34 pts (42%) experienced grade I skin reactions and 47 pts (58%) were without. At the last day of the breast irradiation, there were 66 (81%) grade I (N=59) and II (N=7) skin reactions and 15 pts (19%) without. The early skin tolerance of this scheme was considered to be excellent. But in the 2 weeks after the RT, 20 pts (25%) asked for new clinics with their radiation oncologist as a matter of urgency due to worsening of their skin condition. All of them have been seen by their physician and/or the nurse. Of them, nine presented grade I and 11 presented grade II skin reactions, with necessity of special skin care. The analysis of these results was realized and delayed clinics were organized for all pts treated with this scheme 10-14 days after the end of the radiation treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The breast RT 42.9Gy/13 F have been previously described as an efficacious and well tolerated scheme.

This is the first report of cancer incidence in Tehran from a population-based cancer registry for the period of 1998-2001.
METHODS: The cancer registry collects data on all new cases of cancer diagnosed in the resident population of Tehran metropolitan area. Data collection is active and trained abstractors visit close to 120 data sources comprising cancer diagnostic laboratories, secondary- and tertiary-care hospitals, and imaging centers to abstract cancer cases.
RESULTS: During the period of 1998-2001, a total of 34,318 eligible cases were abstracted of which 24% were identified just by death certificates. The overall age-standardized rates (ASR) (adjusted to the world population structure) were 163.0 per 100,000 males and 141.8 per 100,000 females. The most frequently reported malignancies in males were stomach cancer (ASR 19.8), followed by cancers of the prostate (ASR 15.6), lung (ASR 14.9), bladder (ASR 13.3), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (ASR 7.1), and esophagus (ASR 6.8). In females, the most frequently reported malignancies were breast cancer (ASR 31.4), followed by cancers of the stomach (ASR 10.0), lung (ASR 7.0), ovary (ASR 6.8), and esophagus (ASR 5.3).

Similarly, weight loss, physical activity, and cessation of tobacco use are important behavior changes to reduce colorectal cancer risk, along with the potential benefit for the reduction of red meat consumption and the increase in folic acid intake. Smoking cessation is still the most important prevention intervention for reducing lung cancer risk, but recent evidence indicates that increasing physical activity may also be an important prevention intervention for this disease. The potential benefit of lifestyle change to reduce prostate cancer risk is growing, with recent evidence indicating the importance of a diet rich in tomato-based foods and weight loss. Also, in the cancers for which there are established lifestyle risk factors, such as physical inactivity for breast cancer and obesity for colorectal cancer, there is emerging information on the role that genetics plays in interacting with these factors, as well as the interaction of combinations of lifestyle factors.

METHODS: Postal questionnaire surveys in 1996 and 2006, in representative samples of the general population of Geneva, Switzerland. Participants indicated, for each of 13 health problems, a priority rating for the spending of prevention resources.
RESULTS: There were 742 participants in 1996 (response rate 75%) and 1487 in 2006 (response rate 76%). According to participants, in 2006, resources should be spent, with priority, for: the prevention of sexual abuse of children (67% answered 'high priority'), illegal drugs (58%), AIDS (55%), tobacco smoking (45%), road traffic accidents (43%), alcoholism (42%), family violence (42%), suicide in young people (39%), mammography screening for breast cancer (37%), abuse of medications (27%), cannabis use (24%), poor diet (22%) and lack of physical activity (20%).

There is an increasing trend in breast, prostate and colon cancers, which are considered as typical of economically developed countries. Although breast and prostate cancer rates are still lower than in western countries, they are particularly rapidly increasing. In this paper, we review recently published literature to identify important etiologic factors affecting the cancer risk in Asian populations. Infectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papillomavirus were shown to be associated with elevated risks of stomach, liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Tobacco smoking was shown to be significantly associated with higher lung cancer risk and moderately increased all cancer risk. Excessive alcohol drinking appeared to increase the risk of colorectal cancer in Japanese and breast cancer in the Korean population. Betel nut chewing was associated with higher risk of oral and esophageal cancer. In terms of diet, various studies have demonstrated that high caloric and fat intake was associated with breast cancer risk, salted food intake with stomach cancer, aflatoxin B1 with liver cancer, and low fruits and vegetables intake with breast and lung cancer. Environmental exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, arsenic, radon, asbestos and second hand smoke was shown to increase the lung cancer risk. Reproductive factors such as late age at first childbirth, early menarche, late menopause, oral contraceptive intake, and short duration of lifetime lactation were shown to be associated with breast and/or colorectal cancer. Cancer has clearly become an emerging health threat in Asia and cancer control programs should be actively implemented and evaluated in this region. Various strategies for cancer control have been developed in some Asian countries, including the set-up of national cancer registries, cancer screening programs, education programs for health behavior change, eradication of Helicobacter pylori and vaccination for hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papilloma virus high risk forms. However, more attention should also be paid to low- and medium-resource Asian countries where cancer incidence rates are high, but neither intensive research on cancer for planning effective cancer control programs, nor easy implementation of such programs are available, due to limited financial resources.","2008",,"Asian Pac J Cancer Prev"," In this paper , we review recently published literature to identify important etiologic factors affecting the cancer risk in Asian populations "," review","Asia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Attitude to Health, FALSE, Early Detection of Cancer, FALSE, Environmental Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Health Education, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Life Style, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mass Screening, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Survival Analysis, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Metallothioneins (MTs) are intracellular proteins involved in protecting against Cd. The toxic effects of Cd can be modified by compounds able to modulate MTs synthesis.

In this study we examine the possible role of melatonin in Cd-induced expression of several MT isoforms (MT-2A, MT-1X, MT-1F and MT-1E) in three human tumor cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and HeLa).

Other types of preventive care include aspirin therapy; lipid management; and administration of tetanus and diphtheria, pneumococcal, and influenza vaccines. Although cancer is the second leading cause of death in patients 65 years and older, a survival benefit from cancer screening is not seen unless the patient's life expectancy exceeds five years. Therefore, it is best to review life expectancy, functionality, and comorbidities with older patients when making cancer screening recommendations.

METHODS: We randomly sampled the subjects from the Jeollanamdo Resident Registration Data and we then selected 2,331 widowed women and 4,775 married women. Well-trained examiners measured the height, weight, blood pressure and abdomen circumference, and the women were interviewed with using a questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios(OR) of the two groups.
RESULTS: The smoking rate (OR=2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]1.65, 3.66) was significantly higher for the widowed women. On the contrary, the awareness rate of a smoking cessation campaign (OR=0.80; 95% CI=0.70, 0.92), a quit tobacco telephone line (OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.61, 0.88) and a quit smoking clinic (OR=0.74; 95% CI=0.62, 0.89) were lower for the widowed women.

,"18620559","Temporal trends in breast cancer presentation in the third world.","Anyanwu SN","BACKGROUND: Third world breast cancer is characterized by late presentation, occurrence at relatively young ages and dismal mortality. This poor outcome has encouraged patients to patronize quacks and alternative healers. Public control measures have targeted mainly public education and provision of screening facilities. Recent reports from the developed world indicate a high association with obesity, tobacco and alcohol, habits which though not currently very popular in the third world are nevertheless increasingly accepted.
METHODS: A prospective study initiated in 1985 for all breast cancer patients attending 4 hospitals located in the Eastern Nigeria heartland where the author practiced. On attendance to hospital detailed epidemiological data including social habits were collected from patients.
RESULTS: Reports from our first series [1987-97] showed some improvement in terms of earlier presentation compared to a historical control of earlier reports from the sub-region. Reports from the present study showed that this improvement has not been maintained probably as a result of diversion of public health campaign finances to HIV/AIDS. However there is an increasing mean age of presentation due to a higher representation of above 70 years age group and a significant reduction in parity. Alcohol intake and smoking have remained at low levels among the patients.
CONCLUSION: There is need to take another look at cancer public health campaign mechanisms in the face of competing demands from HIV. Public control measures should include among others teaching of Breast Self Examination [BSE] to patients, Clinical Breast Examination [CBE] to health workers and opportunistic CBE to all patients. Strenuous efforts should be made to break the vicious cycle of late presentation, poor treatment outcome and reluctance of patients to present to health facilities because of poor outcome.","2008",,"J Exp Clin Cancer Res",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Breast Self-Examination, FALSE, Developing Countries, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Nigeria, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Women's Health, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"18557596","Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007.","Clapp RW","What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know.

Unfortunately, this fundamental information is not readily available to patients or physicians. We created simple one-page charts that present the 10-year chance of dying from various causes according to age, sex, and smoking status.
METHODS: We used the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death Public Use File for 2004 and data from the 2004 US Census to calculate age- and sex-specific death rates for various causes of death. We then combined data on smoking prevalence (from the National Health Interview Survey) and the relative risks of death from various causes for smokers vs never smokers (from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study-II) to determine age-, sex-, and smoking-specific death rates. Finally, we accumulated these risks for various starting ages in a series of 10-year life tables. The charts present the 10-year risks of dying from heart disease; stroke; lung, colon, breast, cervical, ovarian, and prostate cancer; pneumonia; influenza; AIDS; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; accidents; and all causes.
RESULTS: At all ages, the 10-year risk of death from all causes combined is higher for men than women. The effect of smoking on the chance of dying is similar to the effect of adding 5 to 10 years of age: for example, a 55-year-old man who smokes has about the same 10-year risk of death from all causes as a 65-year-old man who never smoked (ie, 178 vs 176 of 1000 men, respectively). For men who never smoked, heart disease death represents the single largest cause of death from age 50 on and the chance of dying from heart disease exceeds the chances of dying from lung, colon, and prostate cancers combined at every age. For men who currently smoke, the chance of dying from lung cancer is of the same order of magnitude as the chance dying from heart disease and after age 50 it is about 10 times greater than the chance of dying from prostate or colon cancer. For women who have never smoked, the magnitudes of the 10-year risks of death from breast cancer and heart disease are similar until age 60; from this age on, heart disease represents the single largest cause of death. For women who currently smoke, the chance of dying from heart disease or lung cancer exceeds the chance of dying from breast cancer from age 40 on (and does so by at least a factor of 5 after age 55).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible relationship between passive smoking and breast cancer risk within the Million Women Study, a large UK prospective study, and to report a meta-analysis of published results.
METHODS: In the large prospective study, 224 917 never smokers who completed a questionnaire that asked women whether their parents had smoked and if their current partner smoked were followed up for an average of 3.5 years for incident breast cancer. In the meta-analysis, studies that had recorded exposure information prospectively and retrospectively were considered separately. Main outcome measures Adjusted relative risk of breast cancer in never smokers who were passively exposed to tobacco smoke at various ages compared with never smokers with no such exposure.
RESULTS: In the prospective study, 2518 incident invasive breast cancers occurred during follow-up and the adjusted relative risk of breast cancer for passive exposure either as a child or as an adult vs neither exposure was 0.98 (95% CI 0.88-1.09); results were similarly null for childhood exposure (0.98, 0.88-1.08) and adult exposure (1.02, 0.89-1.16) separately. We identified seven other studies with prospectively recorded exposure data; when results of all eight studies were combined (including 5743 never smokers with breast cancer), the aggregate relative risk was 0.99 (0.93-1.05) for any passive exposure. The aggregate findings differed substantially (P = 0.0002) between these 8 studies and 17 other studies with retrospectively recorded information (including 5696 never smokers with breast cancer).
CONCLUSIONS: Aggregate results from studies with prospectively reported information show that the incidence of breast cancer is similar in women who did and did not report passive exposure to tobacco smoke either as a child or as an adult.

However, there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship between breast cancer risk and total years smoked, cigarettes per day, or pack-years. Neither residential nor workplace secondhand smoke exposure was associated with breast cancer.

TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors conducted a MEDLINE search of the medical and dental literature with the objective of reviewing osteoporosis, its effect on public health in the population in the United States and the implications in providing dental care for these patients. They selected studies by performing a content search with National Library of Medicine medical subject headings (epidemiology, public health impact, treatment, adverse drug reactions, cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis therapy, oral health, periodontal disease, adverse drug reactions, bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaw). They then performed a study design search with a filter so that only randomized clinical trials were included.
RESULTS: Osteoporosis and related fractures are more common than coronary disease, stroke and breast cancer. Fractures resulting from osteoporosis can affect a patient's quality of life severely, and fractures result in functional impairment and increased health care cost and mortality. Medical management of osteoporosis includes diet control, with appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, discontinuation of tobacco and alcohol intake, and use of medications, including selective estrogen receptor modulators, calcitonin, anabolic agents and bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates have been associated with the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three Japanese patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer were asked by an interviewer about risk factors and explanations for the etiology of breast cancer using a four-point scale. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were administered about 2 months later to measure psychological adjustment to the illness. The relationship between each causal attribution and measure of psychological adjustment was assessed with the Spearman rank correlation after adjusting for potential confounders (age, marital status, cancer stage at diagnosis, time between the day of diagnosis and follow-up, and physical symptoms at the follow-up).
MAIN RESULTS: Attributions to several explanations, including ""stress"" and ""personal characteristics,"" were positively associated with the GHQ-28 measures. Of the attributions to risk factors, ""body size"" was significantly inversely (r = -0.29) associated and ""never having children"" was insignificantly and highly inversely (r = -0.77) associated with the GHQ-28 measures, indicating better adjustment to the illness. On the other hand, the attribution to ""tobacco"" was significantly and positively associated with the GHQ-28 measures (r = 0.34), indicating that the attributions antagonized adjustment to the illness.

METHODS: We used the Education and Research Towards Health (EARTH) Study to measure self-reported cancer screening prevalence rates among 11,358 study participants enrolled in 2004-2007. We used prevalence odds ratios to examine demographic, lifestyle and medical factors associated with receiving age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening tests.
RESULTS: The prevalence rates of all the screening tests were higher in Alaska than in the Southwest. Pap test in the past 3 years was reported by 75.1% of women in Alaska and 64.6% of women in the Southwest. Mammography in the past 2 years was reported by 64.6% of women aged 40 years and older in Alaska and 44.0% of those in the Southwest. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years was reported by 41.1% of study participants aged 50 years and older in Alaska and by 11.7% of those in the Southwest US. Multivariate analysis found that location (Alaska versus the Southwest), higher educational status, income and the presence of one or more chronic medical condition predicted each of the three screening tests. Additional predictors of Pap test were age (women aged 25-39 years more likely to be screened than older or younger women), marital status (ever married more likely to be screened), and language spoken at home (speakers of American Indian Alaska Native language only less likely to be screened). Additional predictors of mammography were age (women aged 50 years and older were more likely to be screened than those aged 40-49 years), positive family history of breast cancer, use of smokeless tobacco (never users more likely to be screened), and urban/rural residency (urban residents more likely to be screened). Additional predictors of colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy were age (men and women aged 60 years and older slightly more likely to be screened than those aged 50-59 years), family history of any cancer, family history of colorectal cancer, former smoking, language spoken at home (speakers of American Indian Alaska Native language less likely to be screened), and urban/rural residence (urban residents more likely to be screened).
CONCLUSION: Programs to improve screening among American Indian and Alaska Native people should include efforts to reach individuals of lower socioeconomic status and who do not have regular contact with the medical care system.

,"18289367","A haplotype of polymorphisms in ASE-1, RAI and ERCC1 and the effects of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption on risk of colorectal cancer: a Danish prospective case-cohort study.","Hansen RD","BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of genetic variation in the human genome, and are of interest for the study of susceptibility to and protection from diseases. The haplotype at chromosome 19q13.2-3 encompassing the three SNPs ASE-1 G-21A, RAI IVS1 A4364G and ERCC1 Asn118Asn have been associated with risk of breast cancer and lung cancer. Haplotype carriers are defined as the homozygous carriers of RAI IVS1 A4364GA, ERCC1 Asn118AsnT and ASE-1 G-21AG. We aimed to evaluate whether the three polymorphisms and the haplotype are associated to risk of colorectal cancer, and investigated gene-environment associations between the polymorphisms and the haplotype and smoking status at enrolment, smoking duration, average smoking intensity and alcohol consumption, respectively, in relation to risk of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Associations between the three individual polymorphisms, the haplotype and risk of colorectal cancer were examined, as well as gene-environment interaction, in a Danish case-cohort study including 405 cases and a comparison group of 810 persons. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) were estimated by the Cox proportional hazards model stratified according to gender, and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values were calculated based on robust estimates of the variance-covariance matrix and Wald's test of the Cox regression parameter.
RESULTS: No consistent associations between the three individual polymorphisms, the haplotype and risk of colorectal cancer were found. No statistically significant interactions between the genotypes and the lifestyle exposures smoking or alcohol consumption were observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the ASE-1 G-21A, RAI IVS1 A4364G and ERCC1 Asn118Asn polymorphisms and the previously identified haplotype are not associated with risk of colorectal cancer.

RESULTS: Overall, cancer mortality levelled off in men since 1988 and declined in 1993-2003 (annual percent change, APC = -1.3%). In women, a steady decline has been observed since the early 1970s. The decline in male cancer mortality has been driven by lung cancer, which levelled off since the late 1980s and declined thereafter (APC = 2.7% in 1997-2003). Recent decreases were also observed for other tobacco-related cancers, as oral cavity/pharynx, esophagus, larynx and bladder, as well as for colorectal (APC = -0.9% in 1992-2003) and prostate cancers (APC = -1.0% in 1994-2003). In women, breast cancer mortality levelled off since the early 1990s and declined thereafter (APC = -1.0% in 1998-2003).

Of the differential genes expressed, we found consistent activation of DDX3, a member of the DEAD box RNA helicase family. Overexpression of DDX3 in MCF 10A cells induced an epithelial-mesenchymal-like transformation, exhibited increased motility and invasive properties, and formed colonies in soft-agar assays. Besides the altered phenotype, MCF 10A-DDX3 cells repressed E-cadherin expression as demonstrated by both immunoblots and by E-cadherin promoter-reporter assays.

Activation of caspases, changes in membrane potential, and BCL-2 expression were determined by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Both preparations inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent- manner. Induction of apoptosis was associated with activation of caspases 3, 8 and 9, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and down-regulation of BCL-2 expression.

METHODS: We reviewed each report for criteria used to assess causality: numbers of studies, statistically significant increases in risk, and pooled summary risk estimates.
RESULTS: Both the Surgeon General and CalEPA used updated Bradford Hill criteria for assessing causality and found that the evidence met those criteria. Six of 13 lung cancer studies (46%) had statistically significant increases (one of three cohort studies). Pooled risk estimates for lung cancer for spousal exposure were 1.53 for 10 combined case-control studies and 1.88 for seven studies with dose-response results.

We examined the cancer rates by racial/ethnic group, socioeconomic status and time period to identify disparities underlying the overall mortality trend.
METHODS: We examined racial/ethnic disparities by measuring excess cancer burden [rate ratio (RR) and ratio differences (RD)] and trends in their cancer rates for nine cancer sites. The trend (T) is calculated as a ratio of the average annual cancer mortality rate for 1995-2000 relative to the rate for 1990-1994 for three levels of poverty (counties with <10% living below the poverty level, 10% - <20% and > or =20%) for the major racial/ethnic populations. We also compared the trend for each racial/ethnic SES group to the trend for lowest SES white group (TD).
RESULTS: Blacks have RR disparities relative to whites for each cancer site examined, except for female lung cancer, while the other minorities had RR disparities for cervical cancer (RR>1). There are increases in RR disparities from 1990-1994 to 1995-2000 (RD>0) for colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer for each racial/ethnic minority. Whites and blacks had declining trends for every SES group (T<1) and positive high SES gradients (the highest SES group had the best trend and the lowest SES group had the worst trend) at each cancer site, except female lung cancer (T>1). In contrast, American Indians/Alaska natives, Hispanics and Asians/ Pacific Islanders had increasing trends for some of their cancer sites, and their trends did not have the SES gradients.
CONCLUSIONS: Increases in racial/ethnic disparities (RD>0) for colorectal, breast and prostate cancer were largest in the lowest SES groups.

However, the effect of cigarette smoking on breast cancer risk in mutation carriers is the subject of conflicting reports. We have examined the relation between smoking and breast cancer risk in non-Hispanic white women under the age of 50 years who carry a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using data from carriers of mutations in BRCA1 (195 cases and 302 controls) and BRCA2 (128 cases and 179 controls). Personal information, including smoking history, was collected using a common structured questionnaire by eight recruitment sites in four countries. Odds-ratios (OR) for breast cancer risk according to smoking were adjusted for age, family history, parity, alcohol use, and recruitment site.
RESULTS: Compared to non-smokers, the OR for risk of breast cancer for women with five or more pack-years of smoking was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.6-3.5) for BRCA1 carriers and 2.6 (1.8-3.9) for BRCA2 carriers. Risk increased 7% per pack-year (p<0.001) in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that smoking is associated with increased risk of breast cancer before age 50 years in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. If confirmed, they provide a practical way for carriers to reduce their risks. Previous studies in prevalent mutation carriers have not shown smoking to increase risk of breast cancer, but are subject to bias, because smoking decreases survival after breast cancer.","2008",,"Breast Cancer Res Treat",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Age Factors, FALSE, Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins, FALSE, BRCA1 Protein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, BRCA2 Protein, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, DNA Mutational Analysis, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genes, BRCA1, TRUE, Genes, BRCA2, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mutation, TRUE, Risk, FALSE, Smoking, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: Cancer incidence data were available for up to 82% of the U.S. population. Cancer deaths were available for the entire U.S. population. Long-term (1975 through 2004) and fixed-interval (1995 through 2004) incidence and mortality trends were evaluated by annual percent change using regression analyses (2-sided P < .05). Cancer screening, risk factors, socioeconomic characteristics, incidence data, and stage were compiled for non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and AI/AN across 6 regions of the U.S.
RESULTS: Overall cancer death rates decreased by 2.1% per year from 2002 through 2004, nearly twice the annual decrease of 1.1% per year from 1993 through 2002. Among men and women, death rates declined for most cancers. Among women, lung cancer incidence rates no longer were increasing and death rates, although they still were increasing slightly, were increasing at a much slower rate than in the past. Breast cancer incidence rates in women decreased 3.5% per year from 2001 to 2004, the first decrease observed in 20 years. Colorectal cancer incidence and death rates and prostate cancer death rates declined, with colorectal cancer death rates dropping more sharply from 2002 through 2004. Overall, rates for AI/AN were lower than for NHW from 1999 through 2004 for most cancers, but they were higher for cancers of the stomach, liver, cervix, kidney, and gallbladder. Regional analyses, however, revealed high rates for AI/AN in the Northern and Southern Plains and Alaska. For cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, prostate, and cervix, AI/AN were less likely than NHW to be diagnosed at localized stages.
CONCLUSIONS: For all races/ethnicities combined in the U.S., favorable trends in incidence and mortality were noted for lung and colorectal cancer in men and women and for breast cancer in women. For the AI/AN population, lower overall cancer incidence and death rates obscured important variations by geographic regions and less favorable healthcare access and socioeconomic status.

The study population consisted of 507 breast cancer cases and 425 controls. Odds ratios (OR) were adjusted by multivariate logistic regression analysis for age, body mass index, age at menarche, family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, reproduction parameters, use of contraceptives, tobacco smoking, involuntary tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and education. For homozygous carriers of the Glu allele in APEX1, a significant protective effect was found when compared to Asp/Asp carriers (odds ratio (OR) = 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38-0.94). Subgroup analysis based on menopausal status revealed increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women and OGG1 (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.14-3.69). Reconstructed diplotypes for XRCC1 showed that CGA/CGA carriers had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with carriers of the wild type diplotype CGG/CGG (OR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.28-5.15). When the joint effects of XRCC1, APEX1 and OGG1 polymorphisms were evaluated, individuals homozygous for two or three risk alleles were at increased risk (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.26-2.82).

Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, which transport physiologic and toxic substrates across cell membranes. MRP1 is highly expressed in lung epithelium. This study aims to analyze the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on MRP1 activity. In the human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o-, MRP1 function was studied flow cytometrically by cellular retention of carboxyfluorescein (CF) after CSE incubation and MRP1 downregulation by RNA interference (siRNA). Cell survival was measured by the MTT assay. Immunocytochemically, it was shown that 16HBE14o(-) expressed MRP1 and breast cancer resistance protein. Coincubation of CSE IC50 (1.53% +/- 0.22%) with MK571 further decreased cell survival 31% (p, = 0.018). CSE increased cellular CF retention dose dependently from 1.7-fold at 5% CSE to 10.3-fold at 40% CSE (both p < 0.05). siRNA reduced MRP1 RNA expression with 49% and increased CF accumulation 67% versus control transfected cells. CSE exposure further increased CF retention 24% (p = 0.031). A linear positive relation between MRP1 function and CSE-modulating effects (r = 0.99, p =0.089) was shown in untransfected, control transfected, and MRP1 downregulated 16HBE14o- cells analogous to blocking effects with MRP1 inhibitor MK571 (r = 0.99, p = 0.034). In conclusion, cigarette smoke extract affects MRP1 activity probably competitively in bronchial epithelial cells. Inhibition of MRP1 in turn results in higher CSE toxicity.

The Italian health-care system is organized at a regional level, so regional estimates of cancer indicators are useful to identify priorities for cancer plans. We compared cancer site-specific epidemiological estimates by 3 macro-areas (obtained by grouping regions) to suggest priorities for Italian cancer control plans, both at national and regional levels.
METHODS: Mortality and incidence estimates for all cancers combined and for stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers were downloaded from the website www.tumori.net and aggregated in broad age classes (0-54, 55-74 and 75-84 years) and macro-areas (northern, central and southern Italy).
RESULTS: Historically, Southern Italy had a lower cancer risk than the Center and North. After 2000 this epidemiological picture disappeared and the incidence and mortality rates in the Center are reaching those of the North. Also the weight of various cancer sites on all cancers has changed in Italy in the last decades. Lung cancer is still the most frequent cancer in the male population in the South, while in the Center-North it has been surpassed by prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. The lung cancer weight on all cancer deaths is increasing in women. Prostate cancer has become the most frequent male cancer in the Center-North in the age class 55-84. Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in the female population and its incidence rates in the North are higher than those in the Center-South for all age classes. Colorectal cancer incidence rates have dramatically increased in men and colorectal cancer is nowadays the second cancer diagnosed in women in all age classes and macro-areas.
DISCUSSION: From the epidemiological data here presented we derived the following suggestions and observations for cancer control plans: (a) tobacco prevention should focus on the male population in the South, and on female populations in the country as a whole; (b) prevention concerning diet and physical activity (risk factors for colorectal cancer) should be considered mainly for men at a national level; (c) the coverage of breast cancer screening programs should be increased in the Center-South; (d) colorectal cancer screening should be promoted at a national level; (e) PSA testing (that is not actually included among the screening programs recommended) for prostate cancer is probably more widespread in the Center-North, resulting in an increased incidence without any evident decline in mortality as yet.","2007",,"Tumori"," AIMS AND BACKGROUND : Cancer burden estimates in Italian regions are available for the period 1970-2010 as a result of the project "" I TUMORI IN ITALIA "" connected with EUROCHIP , the European project on cancer control ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Colorectal Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Italy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Primary Prevention, FALSE, methods, Q000379, Prostatic Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Registries, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Stomach Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Survival Rate, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We examined the role of a polymorphism in the XRCC3 gene (rs861529; codon 241: threonine to methionine change) in determining breast cancer risk in Thai women. The study population consisted of 507 breast cancer cases and 425 healthy women. The polymorphism was analysed by fluorescence-based melting curve analysis. The XRCC3 241Met allele was found to be uncommon in the Thai population (frequency 0.07 among cases and 0.05 among controls). Odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age, body mass index, age at menarche, family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, reproduction parameters, use of contraceptives, tobacco smoking, involuntary tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and education were calculated for the entire population as well as for pre- and postmenopausal women. There was a significant association between 241Met carrier status and breast cancer risk (OR 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.44).

In light of the chronic exposure of human breast tissues to tobacco and environmental carcinogens, we have taken an approach of analyzing cellular changes of immortalized non-cancerous human breast epithelial MCF10A cells during the acquisition of cancerous properties induced by repeated exposure to the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) at a low concentration of 100 pM. We found that accumulated exposures of MCF10A cells to NNK result in progressive development of cellular carcinogenesis from a stage of immortalization to precancerous sub-stages of acquiring a reduced dependence on growth factors and acquiring anchorage-independent growth. Using Matrigel for MCF10A cells to form size-restricted acini, we detected that exposures to NNK resulted in altered acinar conformation. Analysis of gene expression profiles by cDNA microarrays revealed up- and down-regulated genes associated with NNK-induced carcinogenesis. Using this cellular carcinogenesis model as a target system to identify anticancer agents, we detected that grape seed proanthocyanadin extract significantly suppressed NNK-induced carcinogenesis of MCF10A cells. Our studies provide a carcinogenesis-cellular model mimicking the accumulative exposure to carcinogens in the progression of human breast epithelial cells to increasingly acquire cancerous properties, as likely occurs in the development of precancerous human breast cells.

This study investigates whether tobacco smoke condensate (TSC), which contains metals and metalloids, elicits estrogen-like effects at environmentally relevant doses. Treatment of human breast cancer cells, MCF-7, with 40 microg/ml TSC resulted in a 2.5-fold stimulation of cell growth. TSC decreased the concentration of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha protein and mRNA (63 and 62%, respectively), and increased the expression of the estrogen-regulated genes, progesterone receptor and pS2 (5- and 2-fold, respectively). In addition, TSC activated ER-alpha in COS-1 or CHO cells transiently transfected with wild-type ER-alpha and an ERE-CAT or an ERE-luciferase reporter gene (11- and 6-fold, respectively). TSC also activated a chimeric receptor (GAL-ER) containing the hormone binding domain of ER-alpha (3.5-fold). It blocked the binding of estradiol to the receptor without altering the affinity of estradiol (K(d) = 2.2-6.8 x 10(-10) m). Transfection assays with ER-alpha mutants identified C381, C447, H524, N532, E523, and D538 in the hormone binding domain as important for activation by TSC. In ovariectomized rats, low doses of TSC [10 or 20 mg/kg body weight (bw)] increased uterine wet weight (1.7- and 2.1-fold), and induced the expression of progesterone receptor and complement C3 in the uterus (2- and 26-fold) and mammary gland (4.4- and 15-fold). Both the in vitro and in vivo TSC effects were blocked by the antiestrogen ICI 182,780, suggesting the involvement of ER.

We investigated the incidence of C3435T polymorphisms at exon 26 in the MDR-1 gene in 92 women with breast cancer and potential association of altered genotypes with smoking and high body mass index in cancer development among patients. The MDR-1C3435T allelotype and genotype analysis revealed a high incidence (75.0%) of polymorph alteration in the MDR-1 gene.

Occupational exposure, dietary consumption and cigarette smoking are sources of Cd contamination. Cd-induced carcinogenicity depends on its oxidative and estrogenic actions. A possible role of Cd in breast cancer etiology has been recently suggested. Melatonin, because of its antioxidant and antiestrogenic properties could counteract the toxic effects of this metalloestrogen. Our aim was both to determine the effects of relevant doses of Cd on mice mammary glands and uterus and to test whether melatonin would counteract its effects. Female mice of different ages and estrogenic status (prepuberal, adult intact, adult ovariectomized) were treated with CdCl(2) (2-3 mg/kg, i.p.), melatonin (10 microg/mL in drinking water), CdCl(2) + melatonin, or diluents. Whereas in prepuberal animals Cd disturbs mammary ductal growth and reduces the number of terminal end buds, in adults, regardless of the steroidal milieu, Cd exerts estrogenic effects on mammary glands, increasing lobuloalveolar development and ductal branching. Uterine weight also increased as a result of Cd treatment. The effects of Cd are partially inhibited by melatonin. In adult ovariectomized mice, Cd concentration in blood of animals treated with CdCl(2) + melatonin was lower than in mice receiving only Cd; the opposite effects were found in non-castrated animals. As Cd mimics the effect of estrogens, the high incidence of breast cancer in tobacco smokers and women working in industries related with Cd could be explained because of the properties of this metal. The effects of melatonin point to a possible role of this indoleamine as a preventive agent for environmental or occupational Cd contamination.","2007",,"J Pineal Res"," Our aim was both to determine the effects of relevant doses of Cd on mice mammary glands and uterus and to test whether melatonin would counteract its effects ","other","Animals, FALSE, Cadmium, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Environmental Pollutants, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Estrogens, Non-Steroidal, FALSE, antagonists & inhibitors, Q000037, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Mammary Glands, Animal, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Melatonin, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Mice, FALSE, Uterus, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: A historical prospective cohort study was performed. The cohort was established from the Norwegian Board of Health's registry of nurses and included women who graduated from a nursing school before 1985. The cohort (N=43 316) was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway. The observed number of cases was compared with the expected number on the basis of national rates. Time since first employment, period of first employment, and duration of employment were used as indicators of exposure.

RESULTS: The nurses were followed over 1473931 person-years. During the follow-up (1953-2002), 6193 cancer cases were observed. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers combined was close to unity. Significantly lower risks were found for cancers with a known association with alcohol and tobacco consumption and sexual activity.

The estimated 2006 rates were applied to the corresponding estimated country population to obtain the best estimates of the cancer incidence and mortality in Europe in 2006.
RESULTS: In 2006 in Europe, there were an estimated 3,191,600 cancer cases diagnosed (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and 1,703,000 deaths from cancer. The most common form of cancers was breast cancer (429,900 cases, 13.5% of all cancer cases), followed by colorectal cancers (412,900, 12.9%) and lung cancer (386,300, 12.1%). Lung cancer, with an estimated 334,800 deaths (19.7% of total), was the most common cause of death from cancer, followed by colorectal (207,400 deaths), breast (131,900) and stomach (118,200) cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The total number of new cases of cancer in Europe appears to have increased by 300,000 since 2004. With an estimated 3.2 million new cases (53% occurring in men, 47% in women) and 1.7 million deaths (56% in men, 44% in women) each year, cancer remains an important public health problem in Europe and the ageing of the European population will cause these numbers to continue to increase even if age-specific rates remain constant. Evidence-based public health measures exist to reduce the mortality of breast and colorectal cancer while the incidence of lung cancer, and several other forms of cancer, could be diminished by improved tobacco control.","2007",,"Ann Oncol",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Epidemiology, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Europe, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Health Surveys, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Residence Characteristics, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The purpose of this study was to create a workflow for an outpatient setting that incorporated a computerized decision support system to implement preventive recommendations as well as to evaluate its impacts on facilitating preventive care.
METHODS: Subjects visiting National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin Branch were evaluated by a questionnaire, which contained items to trigger production rules to check the eligibility of screening for high coronary risk, diabetes mellitus, lipid disorder, hypertension, obesity, tobacco use, depression, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and osteoporosis. Patients were given health information about the diseases they were at risk for and the merits of preventive measures, scheduled for a clinic visit, and arranged to have access to screening tools. Physicians were prompted with clinical reminders on the encounter. The over-all effectiveness of 11 components in this screening program was evaluated in terms of expected life saving. The cost-effectiveness ratio was represented in US dollars per life-year saved.
RESULTS: A total of 283 men and 199 women were identified to need one to six preventive interventions during a 2-month period. Preventive consultation was arranged and screening tools were performed. It was estimated that 412-1014 subjects would be needed to attend the program so as to save one life. The cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from 30,000 US dollars to 40,000 US dollars per life-year saved.

Because cigarette smoking generates reactive species, we hypothesized that NOS3 and MPO polymorphisms could influence susceptibility to breast cancer, particularly among smokers. We examined the associations between NOS3 Glu298Asp and MPO G-463A polymorphisms and breast cancer risk by cigarette smoking among post-menopausal women in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. Included in this analysis were 502 women who provided blood samples and were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1992 and 2001 and 505 cancer-free controls who were matched to the cases by age, race/ethnicity and date of blood donation. Genotyping for NOS3 and MPO was performed using TaqMan, and unconditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). No statistically significant relationships were found between NOS3 and MPO genotypes and breast cancer risk. When considering smoking, variant NOS3 genotypes (GT and TT) were significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk among never smokers (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.45-0.99), but were associated with higher risk among ever smokers (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.05-2.41) and 2-fold increase in risk for those who smoked >10 cigarettes per day (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.21-3.97).

Mortality trends depend on a number of factors including exposures, health system interventions, and possibly artefact (e.g. classification change, variations of data completeness). Descriptive data on mortality only allow for generation of hypotheses to explain observed trends. Some clues on the respective role of possible mortality determinants may be found comparing mortality with incidence and survival data.
METHODS: Mortality data for the periods 1978-1993 and 1994-2004 were supplied by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Regional Causes of Death Registry (ReNCaM) respectively. Sex and site-specific mortality time trends were analysed by the ""joinpoint regression"" method.
RESULTS: For all sites combined, in both sexes, the standardised rate was first increasing before the end of the eighties and decreasing thereafter. Gastric cancer mortality showed a different trend by gender; that is the rate constantly decreased over the period among females while, for males, it was first increasing up to 1985 and decreasing thereafter. Liver cancer trend showed a pattern similar to gastric cancer. Large bowel cancer showed a gender specific trend, that is it was increasing among males and stable among females. Also lung cancer mortality varied by gender: it started to decline after 1989 among males but was steadily increasing over the study period among women. A decreasing trend for female breast cancer mortality began in 1994. Prostate cancer mortality trend is the only one showing two significant joinpoints: mortality decreased up to 1990, then it increased up to 1998 and, finally, was decreasing.
CONCLUSION: Overall cancer mortality was decreasing in both sexes in Umbria and this favourable trend will probably continue and further improve since population screening against breast, cervix, and large bowel cancers were recently introduced. Besides gastric cancer, tobacco-related cancers and prostate cancer mainly contributed to mortality reduction in males, whereas breast cancer mainly contributed to declining mortality in females.","2007",,"BMC Cancer"," The aim of the present paper was to analyse cancer mortality in the Umbria region , from 1978 to 2004 ","other","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Colorectal Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Italy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Liver Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Prostatic Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Regression Analysis, FALSE, Stomach Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Time Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: The data proceeds from the statistical bulletins on death. The 1995-1999 period is compared with the 2000-2004 period, using adjusted rates to the population of Navarre for the year 2001 and the rate of potential years of life lost between 0-70 years adjusted to the European population.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth in the 2000-2004 period was 77.9 years in men and 85 years in women, the latter being one of the highest registered at the world level. Infant mortality fell to 3.3 per 1,000 living newborn infants. The risk of death has fallen in practically all age groups, with a notable fall in mortality of 40% in the 25-34 group at the cost of AIDS. There has been a significant increase of mortality due to lung cancer amongst women under 65 years of age (46%) in the 2000-2004 period with respect to the previous five year period and a sharp fall in mortality due to breast cancer (45.4%). In both sexes there has been a continued fall of mortality due to cerebrovascular diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, cardiac failure and arteriosclerosis and of mortality due to ulcer and cirrhosis. The rates of mortality in Navarre in all the main groups of causes are lower than those of Europe, except for the rate of mortality due to external causes.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase of mortality due to lung cancer and other cancers related to smoking, due to the spread of consumption in recent decades, could have a negative influence on the life expectancy of women in Navarre in coming years. The prevention of mortality due to external causes and the prevention of deaths linked to tobacco consumption are the two priorities that emerge from the data on mortality in this autonomous community.","2006",,"An Sist Sanit Navar",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Catchment Area, Health, FALSE, Cause of Death, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Life Expectancy, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Registries, TRUE, Spain, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The study population consisted of 483 breast cancer patients and 482 healthy population controls, all of homogenous Finnish origin. No statistically significant overall associations were found between the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 genotypes and breast cancer risk. However, a significant increase in the breast cancer risk was seen for women who had smoked 1-9 cigarettes/day and carried the CYP1B1 432Val allele; the OR was 2.6 (95% CI 1.07-6.46) for women carrying the Leu/Val genotype and 5.1 (95% CI 1.30-19.89, P for trend 0.005) for women with the Val/Val genotype compared to similarly smoking women homozygous for the 432Leu allele. Furthermore, when CYP1B1 genotypes were combined with the previously analyzed N-acetyl transferase (NAT2) genotypes, a significant increase in breast cancer risk was found among women who had at least one CYP1B1 432Val allele together with the NAT2 slow acetylator genotype (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.03-2.24) compared to women carrying a combination of CYP1B1 Leu/Leu and NAT2 rapid acetylator genotypes. This risk was seen to be confined to ever smokers; the OR was 2.46 (95% CI 1.11-5.45) for ever smokers carrying at least one CYP1B1 432Val allele together with the NAT2 slow acetylator genotype compared to ever smokers with the CYP1B1 Leu/Leu and NAT2 rapid acetylator genotype combination.

,"17057027","Chemoprevention of second cancers.","Mayne ST","BACKGROUND: ""Second cancers"" can be thought of in two general categories: (a) those occurring as a consequence of cancer treatment and (b) primary cancers that are thought to develop largely as a consequence of prior lifestyle habits (e.g., chronic smoking, drinking, sun exposures), genetic susceptibility, or interactions of the two. Because there has been limited work on chemoprevention of treatment-related secondary cancers, this minireview will focus on chemoprevention of second cancers with lifestyle/genetic origins.
METHODS/RESULTS: Trials aimed at preventing second cancers in patients with tobacco-related cancers (head and neck, lung), skin cancers, breast cancer, and colorectal adenomatous polyps have been completed with some success. However, one finding that has emerged is that, across several cancer sites, subgroups are found with differential response to the chemopreventive agent. For example, smoking status, alcohol consumption, nutritional status, and host tumor characteristics seem to modify chemopreventive efficacy. Stratum-specific (subgroup) findings may occur by chance, requiring a need for supportive evidence from observational epidemiologic studies of the agent (where available), mechanistic studies, or results of other related trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Although chemoprevention of second cancers has been realized, it has become increasingly apparent that not all benefit equally. The finding of subgroup effects in completed trials results in the need to consider such subgroup effects in the design of future trials, by either restricting enrollment to particular subgroups (e.g., never or former smokers), or by increasing sample size requirements to allow for variation in response in subgroups in a statistically powerful way.","2006",,"Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev"," Trials aimed at preventing second cancers in patients with tobacco-related cancers ( head and neck , lung ) , skin cancers , breast cancer , and colorectal adenomatous polyps have been completed with some success "," review","Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, Anticarcinogenic Agents, FALSE, therapeutic use, Q000627, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Clinical Trials as Topic, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, prevention & control, Q000517, Neoplasms, Second Primary, FALSE, drug therapy, Q000188, Nutritional Status, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, beta Carotene, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We reviewed the overall evidence on ETS and breast cancer in nonsmoking women. We extracted details of available studies, derived relative risk (RR) estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) for various ETS exposure indices and conducted meta-analyses. Using an index for each study most closely equivalent to ""spouse ever smoked,"" a weak, but significant, association was seen (random-effects RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02-1.24, n = 22). However, the estimates were heterogeneous: close to 1.0 for prospective, North American and larger studies, and those adjusting for many potential confounders, but significantly (p < .05) elevated in case-control, European, and smaller studies, and those accounting for fewer potential confounders. Risk was increased in premenopausal women (RR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.16-2.05, n = 10), but not postmenopausal women. Dose-response findings were similarly heterogeneous. No significant increase was seen for ETS in childhood or the workplace or from the spouse specifically, but an increase was seen for total exposure (RR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.17-2.04, n = 6). Increases mainly derive from case-control studies asking detailed ETS histories, where RRs depend heavily on who is classified in the totally unexposed reference group, and may be prone to recall bias. Results from prospective studies using similar histories are needed. Study weaknesses and possible publication bias also limit interpretation. Because of the inherent implausibility that ETS exposure might cause breast cancer, given the similar risks of smokers and nonsmokers, one cannot confidently conclude ETS exposure increases risk in nonsmokers.","2006",,"Inhal Toxicol",,"meta analysis","Air Pollution, Indoor, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: Twenty-six published reports (including 3 meta-analyses) evaluating the association between ETS exposure and breast cancer were reviewed. A weight-of-evidence approach was applied to evaluate the data and draw conclusions about the association between breast cancer and ETS exposure.
RESULTS: The published data indicate an association between ETS and breast cancer in younger primarily premenopausal women. Thirteen of 14 studies (10 case-control and four cohort) that allowed analysis by menopausal status reported elevated risk estimates for breast cancer in premenopausal women, seven of which were statistically significant.

Antibodies targeting the ErbB-2 pathway are a preferred therapeutic option for patients with advanced breast cancer, but a worldwide deficit in the manufacturing capacities of mammalian cell bioreactors is foreseen.
METHODS: Herein, we describe a multi-platform approach for the production of recombinant Single chain Fragments of antibody variable regions (ScFvs) to ErbB-2 that involves their functional expression in (a) bacteria, (b) transient as well as stable transgenic tobacco plants, and (c) a newly developed cell-free transcription-translation system.
RESULTS: An ScFv (ScFv800E6) was selected by cloning immunoglobulin sequences from murine hybridomas, and was expressed and fully functional in all the expression platforms, thereby representing the first ScFv to ErbB-2 produced in hosts other than bacteria and yeast. ScFv800E6 was optimized with respect to redox synthesis conditions. Different tags were introduced flanking the ScFv800E6 backbone, with and without spacer arms, including a novel Strep II tag that outperforms conventional streptavidin-based detection systems. ScFv800E6 was resistant to standard chemical radiolabeling procedures (i.e. Chloramine T), displayed a binding ability extremely similar to that of the parental monovalent Fab' fragment, as well as a flow cytometry performance and an equilibrium binding affinity (Ka approximately 2 x 10(8) M(-1)) only slightly lower than those of the parental bivalent antibody, suggesting that its binding site is conserved as compared to that of the parental antibody molecule. ScFv800E6 was found to be compatible with routine reagents for immunohistochemical staining.

DATA SOURCES: Self-reported responses to a demographic and health status questionnaire, to a 3-day Diet Record, and to the 7-Day Physical Activity Questionnaire-Adapted provided data for the lifestyle behaviors. Baseline BMD (g/cm(2)) was determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were also measured in each of the 249 postmenopausal BCS.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an imbalance between consumed kilocalories and expenditure of energy. The majority of BCS were overweight or obese. They consumed less fruit and vegetable servings than recommended by the new 2005 U.S. Department of Agriculture's dietary guidelines, less dairy products, below average recommended grains and fiber, less protein and carbohydrate intake, and a slightly higher fat gram intake. Approximately, 43% did not take any supplemental calcium, with 46% taking less than 1000 mg a day. Likewise, 52.59% consumed less than 400 IU of vitamin D with both supplemental and dietary intake. This group of BCS consumed below accepted levels of caffeine and alcohol. Only 18 BCS continued to smoke. This group spent an average of 10.36 h in light (sedentary) activities on a daily basis. There were significant negative relationships with bone mass (g/cm(2)) at the total hip and daily intake of caffeine/mg and daily grams of alcohol. Weight and BMI both demonstrated a significant relationship with bone mass (g/cm(2)) at the total hip, spine L1-L4, and the forearm.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The healthcare provider must incorporate appropriate teaching strategies, intensive counseling, and coaching, along with a support mechanism, to enable BCS to understand the importance of a healthy diet, calcium, and vitamin D supplement, and a regular strength/weight program that will be integrated into their daily lifestyle. Early DEXA screens should be part of the protocol with BCS, and there is a particular need for forearm DEXA screens to be included in the treatment protocol for BCS.","2006",,"J Am Acad Nurse Pract"," PURPOSE : To describe the baseline healthy lifestyle behaviors ( dietary , calcium , vitamin D , caffeine and alcohol intake , smoking history , and physical activity ) of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors ( BCS ) ; and to identify any relationship of healthy lifestyle behaviors with bone mineral density","other","Absorptiometry, Photon, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, Attitude to Health, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Caffeine, FALSE, Calcium, Dietary, FALSE, administration & dosage, Q000008, Energy Intake, FALSE, Exercise, FALSE, Feeding Behavior, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Health Behavior, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Life Style, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Midwestern United States, FALSE, Obesity, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal, FALSE, complications, Q000150, Self Care, TRUE, methods, Q000379, Smoking Prevention, FALSE, Surveys and Questionnaires, FALSE, Survivors, FALSE, psychology, Q000523",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHOD: Subjects were 147 women (47% Black, 53% White) newly diagnosed with breast cancer and participating in an epidemiologic interview study conducted at two metropolitan area cancer centers in the same city. The epidemiologic interview included women's tobacco, alcohol, and drug use history, medical and family history, and depression symptoms.
RESULTS: Among all women in the sample, 33% reported clinically significant depression symptoms, 10% currently smoked cigarettes, and 57% currently drank alcohol. Seventy percent of women reported experiencing one or more behavioral risk factors, and White women were more likely than Black women to do so. After controlling for other demographic variables, White women were 50% more likely to report clinical symptoms of depression (odds ratio=1.55, 95% confidence interval=1.03, 2.30) and over two times more likely to report being current drinkers (odds ratio=2.19, 95% confidence interval=1.45, 3.30) than were Black women (p<0.05).

,"16924830","Environmental contaminants in pathogenesis of breast cancer.","Mukherjee S","This review is an attempt to comprehend the diverse groups of environmental chemical contaminants with a potential for pathogenesis of breast cancer, their probable sources and the possible mechanisms by which these environmental contaminants act and interplay with other risk factors. Estrogens are closely related to the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Oxidative catabolism of estrogen, mediated by various cytochrome P450 enzymes, generates reactive free radicals that can cause oxidative damage. The same enzymes of estrogenic metabolic pathways catalyze biological activation of several environmental (xenobiotic) chemicals. Xenobiotic chemicals may exert their pathological effects through generation of reactive free radicals. Breast tissue can be a target of several xenobiotic agents. DNA-reactive metabolites of different xenobiotic compounds have been detected in breast tissue. Many phase I and II xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes are expressed in both normal and cancerous breast tissues. These enzymes play a significant role in the activation/detoxification of xenobiotic and endogenous compounds including estrogens. More than 30 carcinogenic chemicals are present in tobacco smoke; many of them are fat-soluble, resistant to metabolism and can be stored in breast adipose tissue. Similarly, pesticides are also known to cause oxidative stress; while some act as endocrine disruptor, some are shown to suppress apoptosis in estrogen sensitive cell lines. Reports have shown an association of smoking (both active and passive) and pesticides with breast cancer risk. However, the issues have remained controversial. Different mutagenic substances that are generated in the cooking process e.g., heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be a threat to breast tissue. PAHs and dioxins exert their adverse effects through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which activates several genes involved in the metabolisms of xenobiotic compounds and endogenous estrogens. These chemicals also induce AhR-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction. Many of the environmental pollutants suppress the immune system, which are implicated to risk. A better understanding about the biological effects of different environmental carcinogenic compounds and determination of their impact on rising incidence of breast cancer will be beneficial in improving preventive policy against breast cancer.","2006",,"Indian J Exp Biol",," review","Animals, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogens, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Pesticides, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Xenobiotics, FALSE, chemistry, Q000737",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

In the present study, the mechanism of CSC-induced transformation of breast epithelial cells was examined. We first determined whether benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)- and CSC-induced levels of APC are capable of inhibiting long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) since our earlier studies had shown that an interaction of APC with DNA polymerase beta (pol-beta) blocks strand-displacement synthesis. With the use of a novel in vivo LP-BER assay, it was demonstrated that increased and decreased APC levels in different breast cancer cell lines were associated with a decrease or increase in LP-BER activity, respectively. The effect of APC on LP-BER in malignant and pre-malignant breast epithelial cell lines was produced by either overexpression or knockdown of APC. Furthermore, it was shown that the decreased LP-BER in B[a]P- or CSC-treated pre-malignant breast epithelial cells is associated with an increased level of APC and decreased cell growth. Our results suggest that the decreased growth allows cells to repair the damaged DNA before mitosis, and failure to repair damaged DNA has the potential to transform pre-malignant breast epithelial cells.","2007",,"Oncogene",,"other","Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Benzo(a)pyrene, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Breast, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cell Line, FALSE, Cell Line, Tumor, FALSE, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, TRUE, DNA Polymerase beta, FALSE, DNA Repair, TRUE, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, RNA, Small Interfering, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Smoke, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Nicotiana, TRUE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"16922636","Cytochrome P450 interactions in human cancers: new aspects considering CYP1B1.","Roos PH","Molecular epidemiological studies are now a powerful tool to determine differential genetic susceptibilities to cancer-causing agents, and to obtain information on potential mechanisms. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) allelic variants are considered biomarkers of susceptibility to cancer. Such variants have an influence on the bioactivation and thereby on the potency of chemical carcinogens. This is very much straight forward for tobacco smoke-related human cancers. A new aspect is the implication of CYP1B1 in tobacco smoke-related cancers at several organ sites. On this basis, the present review is focused on lung, breast, urinary bladder and head and neck cancer. The CYP profile of the human lung includes CYP1A1, -1B1, -2A6, -2A13, -2B6, -2C18, -2E1, -2F1, -3A5 and -4B1. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines, as active components of tobacco smoke, appear as primary chemical factors for lung malignancies. For human mammary cancer, the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been shown to be associated with an increase of breast cancer risk, and there seems to be a link between risks caused by HRT use and modifying polymorphisms of drug/xenobiotic enzymes. Specifically, an association of the CYP1B1*3/*3 genotype with increased breast cancer risks has been postulated. Cigarette smoking is a major cause of human urinary bladder cancer. Arylamines, PAHs and nitrosamines are locally activated within the urothelium. Important CYPs in the bladder epithelium of experimental animals and man are CYP1B1 and -4B1. Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking are known as the major causes of head and neck cancers. Recently, it appears that a polymorphic variant CYP1B1*3/*3 relates significantly to the individual susceptibility of smokers to head and neck cancer, supporting the view that PAH are metabolically activated through CYP1B1. It appears that CYP1B1 plays a key role for the activation of carcinogens at several organ targets, with a likelihood of complex gene-environment interactions implying Phase II enzymes.","2005",,"Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol",," review","Animals, FALSE, Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1, FALSE, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

As tobacco smoking may be one of the few modifiable risk factors for breast cancer, we focused on the association between tobacco smoking and the risk of breast cancer in this review.
METHODS: A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify epidemiological studies on the association between smoking and breast cancer incidence or mortality among the Japanese from 1966 to 2005. Evaluation of associations was based on the strength of evidence and the magnitude of association, together with biological plausibility as previously evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
RESULTS: Three cohort studies and eight case-control studies were identified. The relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) of breast cancer for current smokers ranged from 0.71 to 6.26 in these studies. A significantly increased risk among current smokers compared with never smokers (RR = 1.7) was reported in one out of the three cohort studies. Moderate or strong associations between smoking and breast cancer risk (OR > 2.0) were observed in four of the eight case-control studies.

,"16755941","Modelling predictions of cancer deaths in Northern Ireland.","French D","BACKGROUND: An ageing population has service planners concerned about future levels of disease which are age dependent. Predictions of mortality for colorectal, lung and breast cancers, which account for 30% of cancer cases and 40% of cancers deaths, were calculated for 2010 and 2015, based on trends in death rates and the predicted change in the demography of the Northern Ireland population.
METHODS: The U.S. National Cancer Institute's ""Joinpoint"" program was used to check for structural breaks in the time series of cancer death rates from 1984 to 2004. The prediction models applied to the data allowed variations in trends across age groups to be taken into account. A linear model was used for increasing or constant trends and a log linear model was used where the trend was decreasing. The models assume the number of deaths in each stratum, defined by age-sex and time-period, is Poisson distributed, with the average value determined by a log or linear function.
RESULTS: Recent trends in rates of cancers studied were downwards except for female lung. Predictions include decreased colorectal cancer deaths in females and lung cancer deaths in males. In females, lung cancer deaths are predicted to more than double by the year 2015 (473 deaths), based on the 1984 level. Colorectal death rates in males are predicted to drop, but the number of deaths will increase by more than 10%, due to demographic change. Numbers of breast cancer deaths are likely to rise slightly, despite falling age standardised death rates, due to an ageing population.
CONCLUSIONS: This work has provided estimates of early future trends, useful to service planners, and highlights the need for tobacco control, to reduce numbers of lung cancer deaths in females.

Crosslinkages within the Cancer Register and the Registers of Death and Emigration enabled follow-up. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) of oesophageal and gastric cancer represented relative risks. Among 138 885 cohort members contributing with 1 075 724 person-years of follow-up, we found a nonsignificantly increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma during the potential tamoxifen exposure period (SIR 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-3.08), but the risk estimates decreased with increasing latency interval. No association was observed during the unexposed period. No increased risk of cardia adenocarcinoma was identified in either period. The risk of non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma was increased in the potential tamoxifen period (SIR 1.27, 1.03-1.57), and almost doubled (SIR 1.86, 95% CI 1.10-3.14) in the period of longest latency (10-14 years). The corresponding overall SIR was increased in the unexposed group also, but here SIR did not increase with longer latency intervals. An increased risk of tobacco-related tumours, that is, oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and lung cancer, was limited to the unexposed cohort, indicating that confounding by smoking might explain the increased SIR during the unexposed period.

Some of the findings presented here suggest possible effect modification by genotype. In particular, 14 epidemiologic studies have tended to show positive associations with long-term smoking among NAT2 slow acetylators, especially among postmenopausal women. Summary analyses produced overall meta-relative risk (RR) estimates for smoking of 1.2 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.0-1.5] for rapid acetylators and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8) for slow acetylators. After stratification by menopausal status, the meta-RR for postmenopausal slow acetylators was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.7-3.3), whereas similar analyses for the other categories showed no association. In addition, summary analyses produced meta-RRs for smoking of 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-1.4) when GSTM1 was present and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1-2.1) when the gene was deleted. Overall, however, interpretation of the available literature is complicated by methodologic limitations, including small sample sizes, varying definitions of smoking, and difficulties involving single nucleotide polymorphism selection, which likely have contributed to the inconsistent findings. These methodologic issues should be addressed in future studies to help clarify the association between smoking and breast cancer.","2006",,"Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev",,"meta analysis","Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Confidence Intervals, FALSE, Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA-Binding Proteins, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Epidemiologic Studies, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Genotype, TRUE, Glutathione Transferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Postmenopause, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Superoxide Dismutase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Drug- or toxin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia is indistinguishable from idiopathic acute or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia by clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic criteria. The diagnosis is supported by a temporal relationship to a drug or toxin. The condition usually resolves with removal from the agent and recurs with rechallenge. Treatment involves discontinuation of the offending drug or toxin and treatment with corticosteroids in severe respiratory failure. There are also mass outbreaks of eosinophilic pneumonia reported, such as the toxic-oil syndrome in 1981 and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome related to the ingestion of L-tryptophan in 1989.

In the past, she had been treated for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the face; the referring physician was concerned that the new lesions might also be BCC. The patient had an extensive past medical history. In addition to BCC, she had been treated for breast cancer, colon cancer, and cervical cancer prior to emigrating to the USA. Her colonic malignancy had been localized proximal to the splenic flexure. She also had a history of colonic polyps and distal colonic villous adenoma. She denied ever being treated with radiation. Further details of her medical history and cancer staging were not available. Her family history was significant for a sister with colon cancer and transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. In addition, she had a great aunt with oral cancer and a great uncle with lung cancer. Neither the patient or her relatives had any history of tobacco use. On physical examination, in addition to scars from a radical mastectomy and midline abdominal laparotomy, four skin lesions were noted: two on the scalp, one on the tragus, and one on the mid-back. The first lesion on the vertex of the scalp was a yellow-brown waxy papule measuring 0.6 x 0.5 cm. This lesion was similar to that on the mid-back, except in size. The lesion on the back measured 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The second lesion on the frontal scalp measured 0.8 x 0.6 cm and was red-brown with a pearly appearance and some central hyperkeratosis. The tragus lesion was similar in appearance to that on the frontal scalp. Shave biopsies of all lesions were obtained. The lesions on the scalp and mid-back revealed lobules of sebaceous cells in the dermis with a minority of surrounding basaloid cells, consistent with a diagnosis of sebaceous adenoma (Fig. 1). Although the lesion on the frontal scalp also showed sebaceous differentiation, there were a greater number of basaloid cells, some with hyperchromatic nuclei and mitotic figures; this was consistent with a diagnosis of sebaceous epithelioma (Fig. 2). The final lesion (tragus) was histologically consistent with a keratotic BCC. No further treatment was required for these benign sebaceous tumors, but their presence defined our patient's condition as Muir-Torre syndrome. Mohs' micrographic surgery was performed on the tragus BCC and the margins were tumor free in one stage. The patient returned 1 year later with a lesion anterior to the left axilla which was biopsied to rule out BCC (Fig. 3).

,"16474179","The parity-related protection against breast cancer is compromised by cigarette smoke during rat pregnancy: observations on tumorigenesis and immunological defenses of the neonate.","Steinetz BG","Early pregnancy is a powerful negative risk factor for breast cancer (BCa) in women. Pregnancy also protects rats against induction of BCa by carcinogens such as N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), making the parous rat a useful model for studying this phenomenon. Smoking during early pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of BCa in later life, possibly attributable to carcinogens in cigarette smoke (CS), or to reversal of the parity-related protection against BCa. To investigate these possibilities, 50-day-old timed first-pregnancy rats were exposed to standardized mainstream CS (particle concentration = 50 mg/m3) or to filtered air (FA) 4 h/day, Day 2-20 of gestation. Age-matched virgin rats were similarly exposed to CS or FA. At age 100 days, the CS or FA-exposed, parous and virgin rats were injected s.c. with MNU (50 mg/kg body wt), or with MNU vehicle. Mammary tumors (MTs) first appeared in virgin rats 9 weeks post-MNU injection. While no MTs were detected in FA-exposed parous rats until 18 weeks post-MNU, MTs appeared in the CS-exposed parous rats as early as 10 wks (P < 0.02). As no MTs developed in CS-exposed rats not injected with MNU, CS did not act as a direct mammary carcinogen. Serum prolactin concentration on Day 19 of pregnancy in CS-exposed dams was reduced by 50% compared with FA-exposed dams (P < 0.005). CS exposure during a pregnancy may thus 'deprotect' rats, enhancing their vulnerability to MNU-induced BCa. Prenatal CS exposure had no detectable effect on the immune responses of the pups examined at 3, 8 or 19 weeks of age. However, prolactin concentration in stomach contents (milk) of 3-day-old pups suckled by CS-exposed dams was decreased when compared with that of FA-exposed dams (P < 0.032). As milk-borne prolactin modulates development of the central nervous and immune systems of neonatal rats, CS exposure of the dams could adversely affect later maturation of these systems by reducing milk prolactin.","2006",,"Carcinogenesis"," To investigate these possibilities , 50-day-old timed first-pregnancy rats were exposed to standardized mainstream CS ( particle concentration = 50 mg / m3 ) or to filtered air ( FA ) 4 h / day , Day 2-20 of gestation ","other","Animals, FALSE, Carcinogens, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Killer Cells, Natural, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Lymphocytes, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Male, FALSE, Mammary Neoplasms, Animal, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Methylnitrosourea, FALSE, Pregnancy, FALSE, Pregnancy, Animal, FALSE, Prolactin, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, FALSE, Sex Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

We hypothesized that COMT-LL women exposed actively or passively to tobacco smoke would have higher exposure to 2-hydroxylated estradiol than never-active/never passive exposed women, and should therefore have a lower risk of breast cancer than women exposed to tobacco smoke or with higher COMT activity.
METHODS: We used a case-only design to evaluate departure from multiplicative interaction between COMT genotype and smoking status. We identified 502 cases of invasive incident breast cancer and characterized COMT genotype. Information on tobacco use and other potential breast cancer risk factors were obtained by structured interviews.
RESULTS: We observed moderate departure from multiplicative interaction for COMT-HL genotype and history of ever-active smoking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7, 3.8) and more pronounced departure for women who smoked 40 or more years (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 0.8, 7.0). We observed considerable departure from multiplicative interaction for COMT-HL genotype and history of ever-passive smoking (aOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 0.8, 5.2) or for having lived with a smoker after age 20 (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 0.8, 10).

Functional, allelic, single nucleotide polymorphisms occur in an SP1-binding element of hGSTA1 and in the coding regions of hGSTA2 and hGSTA3. The main effects of these polymorphisms are the low hepatic expression of hGSTA1 in individuals homozygous for hGSTA1*B and the low specific activity of the hGSTA2E-2E variant toward FA-OOH. These properties suggest that alpha class GSTs will be involved in susceptibility to diseases with an environmental component (such as cancer, asthma, and cardiovascular disease) and in response to chemotherapy. Although hGSTM1, hGSTT1, and hGSTP1 have been associated with such diseases (on the basis of genetic polymorphisms as indicators of expression), alpha class GSTs have been little studied in this respect. Nevertheless, hGSTA1*B has been associated with increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer and with increased efficacy of chemotherapy for breast cancer.

The inhibitory effects on estrogen were also examined using the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, the aromatase assay, and the 17beta-estradiol (E2) metabolism assay. The results showed that MSC induced the antiestrogenic effect via the ER-mediated pathway, while THC, CBD, and CBN did not have any antiestrogenic activity. This suggests that the combined effects of the marijuana smoke components are responsible for the antiestrogenicity of marijuana use. In addition, MSC induced the CYP1A activity and the E2 metabolism, but inhibited the aromatase activity, suggesting that the antiestrogenic activity of MSC is also related to the indirect ER-dependent pathway, as a result of the depletion of the in situ E2 level available to bind to the ER.

African-American (AA) men in South Carolina have among the highest prostate cancer rates in the world, and thus provide an ideal population in which to investigate this hypothesis.
METHODS: We recruited AA men attending prostate cancer screenings in and around Columbia, South Carolina. Because very few men had elevated PSAs, we restricted our study to the 77 men whose PSA was below the cutpoint used by the screening program to indicate need for diagnostic workup. These men provided spot urine samples and answered demographic and lifestyle questions including self-reported body weight, height, exercise, tobacco use, medications, cancer history and age. Levels of urinary 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) and 16alpha-hydroxyestrone (16alpha-OHE1), and their ratio (2/16) and blood PSA levels were determined.
RESULTS: After adjusting for a statistically significant interaction between age and BMI, we found a reduction of 14.2% in 2-OHE1 for each 1.0 ng/ml increase in PSA (p=0.05). For obese AA men only (BMI> or =30 kg/m2), 2-OHE1 increased by 36% for each decade of age (p=0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen metabolites may be related to PSA level in AA men. Older men with BMIs greater than 30 kg/m2 had an unexpected increase in 2-OHE1, suggesting a dysregulation of this estrogen metabolism pathway.

SAs comprise people having origins mainly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. We calculated age-adjusted incidence and time trends of cancer in the SA population of California (state with the largest concentration of SAs) between 1988-2000 and compared these rates to rates in native Asian Indians as well as to those experienced by the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and White, non-Hispanic population (NHW) population of California.
METHODS: Age adjusted incidence rates observed among the SA population of California during the time period 1988-2000 were calculated. To correctly identify the ethnicity of cancer cases, 'Nam Pehchan' (British developed software) was used to identify numerator cases of SA origin from the population-based cancer registry in California (CCR). Denominators were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. Incidence rates in SAs were calculated and a time trend analysis was also performed. Comparison data on the API and the NHW population of California were also obtained from CCR and rates from Globocan 2002 were used to determine rates in India.
RESULTS: Between 1988-2000, 5192 cancers were diagnosed in SAs of California. Compared to rates in native Asian Indians, rates of cancer in SAs in California were higher for all sites except oropharyngeal, oesophageal and cervical cancers. Compared to APIs of California, SA population experienced more cancers of oesophagus, gall bladder, prostate, breast, ovary and uterus, as well as lymphomas, leukemias and multiple myelomas. Compared to NHW population of California, SAs experienced more cancers of the stomach, liver and bile duct, gall bladder, cervix and multiple myelomas. Significantly increasing time trends were observed in colon and breast cancer incidence.
CONCLUSION: SA population of California experiences unique patterns of cancer incidence most likely associated with acculturation, screening and tobacco habits. There is need for early diagnosis of leading cancers in SA.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 483 incident breast cancer cases and 482 population controls of Finnish Caucasian origin. The genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP-based methods. Odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: No statistically significant overall effect in the breast cancer risk was seen for any of the studied polymorphisms. However, a significant increase in breast cancer risk was seen among ever smoking women if they carried at least one XRCC1-399 Gln allele (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.30-4.19, pint 0.025) or XPD-751 Gln/Gln genotype (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.27-5.03, pint 0.011) compared to smoking women not carrying these genotypes. The risks were found to be confined to women smoking at least five pack-years; the respective ORs were 4.14 (95% CI 1.66-10.3) and 4.41 (95% CI 1.62-12.0). Moreover, a significant trend of increasing risk with increasing number of the putative at-risk genotypes (p for trend 0.042) was seen.

We accessed the lung dose in relation to different radiotherapy techniques, provided the excess relative risk (ERR) estimate for radiation-associated lung cancer, and evaluated the influence of tobacco use.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Swedish Cancer Registry was used to identify 182 women diagnosed with breast and subsequent lung cancers in Stockholm County during 1958 to 2000. Radiotherapy was administered to 116 patients. Radiation dose was estimated from the original treatment charts, and information on smoking history was searched for in case records and among relatives. The risk of lung cancer was assessed in a case-only approach, where each woman contributed a pair of lungs.
RESULTS: The average mean lung dose to the ipsilateral lung was 17.2 Gy (range, 7.1 to 32.0 Gy). A significantly increased relative risk (RR) of a subsequent ipsilateral lung cancer was observed at > or = 10 years of follow-up (RR = 2.04; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.36). Squamous cell carcinoma (RR = 4.00; 95% CI, 1.50 to 10.66) was the histopathologic subgroup most closely related to ionizing radiation. The effect of radiotherapy was restricted to smokers only (RR = 3.08; 95% CI, 1.61 to 5.91). The ERR/Gy for women with latency > or = 10 years after exposure was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.44).

A polymorphism in the sulfotransferase 1A1 gene (SULT1A1) results in an amino acid change from Arg to His at codon 213. The His allele (SULT1A1*2) has been shown to encode a protein with much lower catalytic activity than the protein encoded by the Arg allele (SULT1A1*1). We examined whether this polymorphism modified breast cancer risk in a Finnish-Caucasian study population consisting of 483 breast cancer patients and 482 healthy population controls. No significant genotype effects were seen in the overall breast cancer risk. However, a decreased risk of breast cancer was found among premenopausal women with at least three pregnancies and at least one SULT1A1*2 allele (odds ratio = 0.23, 95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.63) compared to women with two SULT1A1*1 alleles.

In contrast, its impact on the risk of adult leukemia has received little attention.
METHODS: We used the lifetime residential and occupational ETS exposure histories from a population-based sample of 1068 incident and histologically confirmed adult leukemia cases and 5039 population controls age 20 to 74 years to evaluate the relationship between ETS exposure and adult leukemia risk among nonsmokers in Canada. The duration of exposure and smoker-years index were used as indices of ETS exposure. We restricted our analysis to the 266 case and 1326 control subjects who reported being lifetime nonsmokers and provided residential ETS exposure history for at least 75% of their lifetime.
RESULTS: No association was found for most leukemia subtypes, and in particular for acute myeloid leukemia. In contrast, the risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was clearly associated with ETS exposure, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-4.5) for more than 83 smoker-years of residential exposure and 2.4 (1.3-4.3) for more than 72 smoker-years of occupational exposure.

Mammary epithelial cells (MECs) from sexually immature (3-week (wk)-old) Fischer 344 rats were more sensitive than mature (8-wk-old) rats to the carcinogenic, lethal, and mutagenic effects of N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU). The work reported here was undertaken to better define this age-specific susceptibility of the mammary gland to NMU. Using the alkaline comet assay, it was found that MECs from immature but not mature rats displayed an increase in single-strand DNA breaks or alkali-labile lesions 2 h following NMU treatment. Hoechst staining indicated apoptosis was not responsible for the increase. Inhibition of methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) did not affect immature MECs but caused mature MECs to recapitulate the immature response to NMU. Direct measurement of MGMT activity revealed that immature MECs are significantly deficient in MGMT activity relative to mature MECs. MECs had the lowest MGMT activity of all organs tested. Immature kidneys, which preferentially developed nephroblastomas after NMU treatment, also displayed significantly lower MGMT activity than mature kidneys. These results suggest that age-related differences in MGMT activity may play a significant role in age-differential susceptibility to rat mammary gland and kidney carcinogenesis, and argue the importance of extending these studies to humans. They also provide a mechanistic basis for studying, as potentially initiating events in breast cancer, exposures of prepubertal girls to alkylating agents, to which humans are exposed in cigarette smoke, the diet, and as chemotherapy.","2005",,"Mol Carcinog",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Apoptosis, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Carcinogens, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Cell Differentiation, TRUE, Cells, Cultured, FALSE, Comet Assay, FALSE, Disease Susceptibility, TRUE, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Female, FALSE, Mammary Neoplasms, Animal, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139, Methylnitrosourea, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase, FALSE, deficiency, Q000172, Rats, FALSE, Rats, Inbred F344, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the effect of increasing B[a]P concentrations on COX-II expression, PGE(2) output, and invasion using MDA-MB-231 cells, an invasive estrogen unresponsive breast cancer cell line. B[a]P significantly increased invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells at concentrations greater than 4 x 10(-8) M.

Immunohistochemical staining and Western blots demonstrated a significant B[a]P treatment-induced increase in both the number of COX-II immunopositive MDA-MB-231 cells and COX-II protein levels. Moreover, B[a]P-treatment induced a profound (46 fold) increase in PGE(2) production by MDA-MB-231 cells. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonists resveratrol (RES) and alpha-naphthaflavone (alpha-NF) had no effect on their own, whereas B[a]P-induced invasion was significantly inhibited by co-treatment with RES and alpha-NF.

RESULTS: Overall, 18 cases were observed compared with 8.9 expected, corresponding to a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.2].

Women who possess homozygous polymorphic alleles have a slower rate of metabolic activation of aryl aromatic amines, one of the constituents of tobacco smoke that has been identified as carcinogenic. We hypothesized that women with breast cancer who were slow acetylators would be at increased risk of breast cancer associated with active and passive exposure to tobacco smoke.
METHODS: We used a case-only study design to evaluate departure from multiplicativity between acetylation status and smoking status. We extracted DNA from buccal cell samples collected from 502 women with incident primary breast cancer and assigned acetylation status by genotyping ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Information on tobacco use and breast cancer risk factors was obtained by structured interviews.
RESULTS: We observed no substantial departure from multiplicativity between acetylation status and history of ever having been an active smoking (adjusted odds ratio estimate of departure from multiplicativity = 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.7) or ever having had passive residential exposure to tobacco smoke (adjusted odds ratio = 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.5). The estimates for departure from multiplicativity between acetylation status and various measures of intensity, duration, and timing of active and passive tobacco exposure lacked consistency and were generally not supportive of the idea of a gene-environment interaction.

METHODS: During 1995--2000, 54,487 invasive breast cancer cases were reported in Texas. We identified 12 toxicants released into the environment by industry that: (1) were positively associated with breast cancer in epidemiological studies, (2) were Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) chemicals designated as carcinogens or had estrogenic effects associated with breast cancer risk, and (3) had releases consistently reported to EPA TRI for multiple Texas counties during 1988--2000. We performed univariate, and multivariate analyses adjusted for race and ethnicity to examine the association of releases for these toxicants during 1988--2000 with the average annual age-adjusted breast cancer rate at the county level.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis indicated that formaldehyde, methylene chloride, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, chromium, cobalt, copper, and nickel were positively associated with the breast cancer rate. Multivariate analyses indicated that styrene was positively associated with the breast cancer rate in women and men (beta=0.219, p=.004), women (beta=0.191, p=0.002), and women >or= 50 years old (beta=0.187, p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: Styrene was the most important environmental toxicant positively associated with invasive breast cancer incidence in Texas, likely involving women and men of all ages.

Women prenatally exposed to maternal cigarette smoke may, therefore, have a lower breast cancer risk because the fetal mammary gland's exposure to maternal estrogen is decreased. Associations between prenatal maternal cigarette smoke exposure and breast cancer, however, have not been observed in previous case-control studies that relied on exposure assessment after the onset of cancer. At the start of this study, cigarette smoking history was obtained directly from the mother.
METHODS: The National Cooperative DES Adenosis project was a follow-up study of health outcomes in women prenatally exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES). At the start of the study, women's mothers provided information about cigarette smoking habits during the time they were pregnant with the study participant. In the current study, the breast cancer rates are compared among 4031 women who were or were not prenatally exposed to maternal cigarette smoke. The resultant relative rate (RR) is adjusted for potential confounding by other breast cancer risk factors using Poisson regression modeling.
RESULTS: Fetal exposure to maternal cigarette smoke appeared to be inversely associated with breast cancer incidence (RR = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-1.03). The inverse association was more apparent among women whose mothers smoked 15 cigarettes or fewer per day than among daughters of heavier smokers.

RESULTS: The overall risk for breast cancer in women who were carriers of at least one SULT1A1*2 allele was not significantly different from that for women with the SULT1A1*1/*1 genotype (adjusted odds ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.66-1.06). Risk for breast cancer with respect to several smoking variables did not differ substantially between carriers of the *2 allele and noncarriers. However, among NAT2 fast acetylators, the odds ratio associated with passive smoking only (3.23, 95% confidence interval 1.05-9.92) was elevated in homozygous carriers of the SULT1A1*1 allele but not in carriers of the SULT1A1*2 allele (odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 0.50-3.31).
CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that the SULT1A1 genotype in itself modifies breast cancer risk associated with smoking in women up to age 50 years. In combination with NAT2 fast acetylator status, however, the SULT1A1*1/*1 genotype might increase breast cancer risk in women exposed to tobacco smoke.","2005",,"Breast Cancer Res",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Age of Onset, FALSE, Arylsulfotransferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Germany, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Polymerase Chain Reaction, FALSE, Polymorphism, Genetic, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: We followed 102,098 women, ages 30 to 50 years, completing a mailed questionnaire at recruitment to the Norwegian-Swedish Cohort Study in 1991/1992, through December 2000. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate relative risk (RR) of breast cancer associated with different measures of smoking initiation, duration, and intensity adjusting for confounding variables. We conducted analyses on the entire study population, among women who had smoked for at least 20 years, among nondrinkers, and separately for each country.
RESULTS: Altogether, 1,240 women were diagnosed with incident, invasive breast cancer. Compared with never smokers, women who smoked for at least 20 years and who smoked 10 cigarettes or more daily had a RR of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.06-1.70). Likewise, those who initiated smoking prior to their first birth (1.27, 1.00-1.62), before menarche (1.39, 1.03-1.87), or before age 15 (1.48, 1.03-2.13) had an increased risk. In contrast, women who had smoked for at least 20 years, but started after their first birth, did not experience an increased breast cancer risk. The increased RR associated with smoking was observed among nondrinkers of alcohol, women with and without a family history of breast cancer, premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and in both countries.

Remarkably, there is little knowledge about the impact smoking has on the efficacy and side effects of HRT. However, it has been proven that, depending on the type, duration and intensity of nicotine consumption, smoking can reduce or completely cancel the efficacy of orally administered estrogens. Not only does smoking diminish the otherwise well-established beneficial effects of estrogen on hot flashes and urogenital symptoms and its positive effects on lipid metabolism, i.e. by reducing cholesterol, but smoking also specifically reduces estrogen's ability to prevent osteoporosis. The reduction or loss of therapeutic efficacy is mainly caused by dose-dependent elevated hepatic clearance, partially in conjunction with lower estrogen levels, and has been demonstrated only with oral estrogen applications. This failure of therapeutic action should not be compensated for by increasing the dose in smokers as this might result in the production of toxic, even potentially mutagenic estrogen metabolites--compounds recently associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. The favorable effects of estrogens are not lost in smokers when they are applied transdermally. This route enables low dosage and also avoids the formation of unphysiological metabolites by bypassing the liver. Women who continue to smoke despite all warnings should therefore only be treated via the transdermal route. Oral contraceptives, but not HRT, are contraindicated in elderly smokers. However, the principal conclusion of the WHI study was that the lowest dose possible should be chosen, especially in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, as is the case in smokers.","2005",,"Curr Med Chem Cardiovasc Hematol Agents",,"other","Administration, Cutaneous, FALSE, Cardiovascular System, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Clinical Trials as Topic, FALSE, Estradiol, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogens, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Female, FALSE, Hormone Replacement Therapy, TRUE, Humans, FALSE, Osteoporosis, FALSE, prevention & control, Q000517, Smoking, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The NAT2 gene is highly polymorphic and several different allelic variants exist that determine the acetylator phenotype.

We wished to determine if this regulation exists in breast adenocarcinomas. Expression of mRNA that encodes a G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK1) has been shown in tissue samples from approximately 40% of primary human breast cancers. Previously, GIRK channels have been associated with beta-adrenergic signaling.
METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were screened for GIRK channels by RT-PCR. Cell cultures of breast cancer cells were treated with beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists, and changes in gene expression were determined by both relative competitive and real time PCR. Potassium flux was determined by flow cytometry and cell signaling was determined by western blotting.
RESULTS: Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-361 MDA-MB 453, and ZR-75-1 expressed mRNA for the GIRK1 channel, while MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-435S did not. GIRK4 was expressed in all six breast cancer cell lines, and GIRK2 was expressed in all but ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-435. Exposure of MDA-MB-453 cells for 6 days to the beta-blocker propranolol (1 microM) increased the GIRK1 mRNA levels and decreased beta2-adrenergic mRNA levels, while treatment for 30 minutes daily for 7 days had no effect. Exposure to a beta-adrenergic agonist and antagonist for 24 hours had no effect on gene expression. The beta adrenergic agonist, formoterol hemifumarate, led to increases in K+ flux into MDA-MB-453 cells, and this increase was inhibited by the GIRK channel inhibitor clozapine. The tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a high affinity agonist for beta-adrenergic receptors stimulated activation of Erk 1/2 in MDA-MB-453 cells.

Most of these were from central and eastern European countries with comparably high cancer mortality rates and with relatively unfavorable trends. Therefore, it is important to provide updated mortality data regarding major cancers in various countries and to analyze trends for the current population of the EU.
METHODS: The authors considered mortality rates (directly standardized to the world standard population) for all cancers and for 8 major cancer sites in the year 2000 in the 25 countries of the EU and analyzed corresponding trends since 1980 using data derived from the World Health Organization data base.
RESULTS: For men, overall cancer mortality in the year 2000 varied by a factor > 2 between the highest rate of 258.5 per 100,000 men in Hungary and the lowest rate of 122.0 per 100,000 men in Sweden. Central and Eastern European accession countries had the highest rates not only for lung and other tobacco-related cancers but also for gastrointestinal cancers and leukemias. The geographic pattern was different and the range of variation was smaller for women, i.e., between 136.7 per 100,000 women in Denmark and 76.4 per 100,000 women in Spain in the year 2000. In the EU as a whole, lung cancer mortality in men peaked at 55.4 per 100,000 men in 1988 and declined thereafter to 46.7 per 100,000 men in 2000. Gastric cancer steadily declined from 19.7 per 100,000 men in 1980 to 10.1 per 100,000 men in 2000. Other major sites showed moderately favorable trends over the last few years. In women, breast cancer peaked at 21.7 per 100,000 in 1989 and declined to 18.9 per 100,000 in 2000. Mortality from gastric, (cervix) uterus, and intestinal cancers demonstrated steady decreases, but lung cancer increased from 7.7 per 100,000 women in 1980 to 11.1 per 100,000 women in 2000. The increase in lung cancer mortality in women age < 55 years was 38% between 1990 and 2000 (from 2.16 per 100,000 women to 2.99 per 100,000 women), reflecting the spread of tobacco smoking among women in the EU over the last few decades.

It involves a comparison of variation in incidence and prevalence rates between Jews and non-Jews. However, the reader must exercise a certain amount of skepticism when considering secular changes in cancer incidence and prevalence and the public health implications of such cancer variation. Ashkenazi Jews have a lifetime CRC risk of 9--15%. This elevated CRC risk is similar to that of individuals in the ""familial risk'' category, and differs strikingly from the 5-6% CRC risk for non-Ashkenazi members of general Western populations. A MedLine search tested the hypothesis that site-specific and/or all-cancer incidence and mortality rates are either higher or lower than expected in Ashkenazi Jews worldwide, when compared with reference populations. Results showed that all cancer incidence and mortality is not higher in Ashkenazi Jews when compared to North American non-Hispanic whites. Indeed, rates for some cancers, such as carcinoma of the lung in Ashkenazi males, are low; this example is likely attributable in large part to decreased tobacco use. Carcinoma of the ovary, pancreas, stomach, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have a higher incidence rate in Ashkenazi. Even though BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations which predispose to carcinoma of the breast and ovary appear increased in Ashkenazi breast cancer affected women, there was no evidence supporting an elevated risk of breast cancer among Ashkenazi women. Our primary concern, however, is that Ashkenazi Jews may have one of the highest lifetime CRC risks of any ethnic group in the world, a risk that diverges significantly from that of the general population; therein, it logically calls for more intensive CRC screening guidelines. We have emphasized that the reader use caution in the interpretation of statistics which portray variation in incidence and prevalence figures for cancer in any racial, ethnic, or religious group, inclusive, of course, of Jews. Clearly, more research will be required in the interest of accuracy in the understanding of these cancer variations, since they portend the need for special cancer control strategies. A lesser degree of attention can then be given to carcinoma of the penis and uterine cervix, which occur very infrequently in Jews.

Three components were studied that included analysis of factors related to cardiac function (prior cardiac surgery, specific cardiac disorders, and cardiac medications), analysis of risk factors related to cardiac disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and tobacco use), and analysis of factors related to the reconstruction (selection of recipient vessels, type of reconstruction). The women were stratified based on age-50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, and older than 70 years-to analyze trends based on advancing age. Results demonstrated that the incidence of coronary artery disease was 2 in 240 women (0.8%) and that the incidence of factors related to cardiac function and the incidence of risk factors related to cardiac disease appear to increase with advancing age. The internal mammary vessels were used in 35 of 114 free tissue transfers with no adverse sequelae. No woman in whom the internal mammary artery was used has developed coronary artery disease.

METHODS: Analyses were based on 1995 data collected from the California Teachers Study (CTS) and were restricted to those with complete and usable tobacco data (n = 128,174). Age-adjusted and race-adjusted odds ratios (OR) were generated by unconditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: Compared with never smokers, both current and former smokers experienced menarche at an earlier age. Current and former smokers also were more likely than their never smoking counterparts to be nulliparous. Among parous women, current, but not former smokers were less likely than never smokers to have had their first child at an older age. Similarly, among never smokers, those exposed to household passive smoking experienced menarche at an earlier age, were more likely to be nulliparous, and among parous women, were less likely to have had their first child at an older age than never smokers not exposed to passive smoking. Greater alcohol consumption was strongly associated with both active and passive smoking exposures. Compared with never smokers, current smokers were less likely to take antioxidant supplements, whereas former smokers were more likely to take antioxidant supplements. Among never smokers, antioxidant use did not differ depending on passive smoking exposure. A number of other dietary correlates of active and passive smoking were identified.

National data based on a total of 4388 cases diagnosed during the year 1998 were reviewed and analyzed.
METHODS: Crude and age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population were calculated and results were contrasted with estimates from developed and selected developing countries in the region.
RESULTS: Among males, bladder (18.5%), prostate (14.2%), and lung cancer (14.1%) were the most frequently reported malignancies. Among females, breast cancer alone accounted for over a third of all cancers, followed by colon cancer (5.8%), and cancer of the corpus uteri (4.8%). Sex-differentials in incidence rates were highest for tobacco-related cancers (lung, larynx, and bladder). Compared with current estimates worldwide, ASRs for bladder cancer in Lebanon showed strikingly high rates. Whereas ASRs for breast and prostate cancer remained lower than those observed in developed countries, they were greater than those estimated from neighboring countries with a similar epidemiological transition as Lebanon.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the comparative assessments most likely reflect differentials in prevalence of risk factors and lifestyle variables (e.g., lung and breast cancers) and can be partly explained by improvement in cancer detection rate in recent years (for prostate cancer).

Deletion polymorphisms in the genes GSTM1 and GSTT1 and a base transition polymorphism at codon 105 (Ile-->Val) in GSTP1 were investigated in relation to breast cancer risk. Tobacco smoking and reproductive factors were examined as potential effect modifiers. Individual data from seven case-control studies were pooled within the International Collaborative Study on Genetic Susceptibility to Environmental Carcinogens. To measure the effect of GSTs on breast cancer risk, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed adjusting for study center and age. The modifying effect was investigated by stratification on variables of smoking habits and reproductive history. A total of 2,048 cases with breast cancer and 1,969 controls were analyzed. The relative odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of breast cancer was 0.98 (0.86-1.12) with the GSTM1 null, 1.11 (0.87-1.41) with the GSTT1 null, 1.01 (0.79-1.28) with GSTP1 heterozygous mutants, and 0.93 (0.62-1.38) with GSTP1 homozygous mutants. Stratification by smoking or reproductive factors did not reveal a modifying effect of these variables, nor was there any association between GSTM1 and age at diagnosis of breast cancer. This is the largest study investigating susceptibility to breast cancer due to polymorphisms in the GST genes. The results conclusively show that single gene GST polymorphisms do not confer a substantial risk of breast cancer to its carriers. Furthermore, GSTs did not interact with smoking or reproductive history to modify cancer risk.","2004",,"Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev",,"other","Acyltransferases, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Base Sequence, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Carcinogens, Environmental, FALSE, pharmacokinetics, Q000493, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Chromosome Deletion, FALSE, Codon, FALSE, DNA Mutational Analysis, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genetic Carrier Screening, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Genotype, FALSE, Glutathione Transferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Humans, FALSE, Meta-Analysis as Topic, FALSE, Polymorphism, Genetic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

HDL-C represents an important aspect of the syndrome, yet its role in breast cancer is still undefined.
METHODS: In two population-based screening surveys during 1977-1983 and 1985-1987, serum HDL-C was assayed enzymatically among 38,823 Norwegian women aged 17-54 years at entry. Height, weight, blood pressure, serum lipids, fat and energy intake, physical activity, parity, oral contraceptive use, hormone therapy use, alcohol intake, and tobacco use were also assessed. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer associated with serum HDL-C levels and to adjust for potential confounding variables. We performed stratified analyses to evaluate effect modification by body mass index (BMI) and menopausal status. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 17.2 years, we identified 708 cases of invasive breast cancer. In multivariable analysis, the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer was inversely related to quartile of HDL-C (P(trend) =.02). Among women with HDL-C above 1.64 mmol/L (highest quartile) versus below 1.20 mmol/L (lowest quartile), the relative risk was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58 to 0.97). The HDL-C association was confined to women in the heavier subgroup (BMI > or =25 kg/m2), for whom the relative risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in those with HDL-C above 1.64 mmol/L versus below 1.20 mmol/L was 0.43 (95% CI = 0.28 to 0.67; P(trend)<.001; P(interaction) =.001).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between indicators of extreme poverty and social unrest, along with unemployment, and mortality in Barcelona, during the years 1989 to 1993. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out using Primary Health Care Areas (PHCAs) as the unit of analysis. The study population consisted of residents in Barcelona City. The indicators studied as dependent variables were the age-standardized mortality rates of the following causes of death: total mortality; lung cancer; bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma; cirrhosis; cerebrovascular disease; ischemic heart disease; breast cancer; traffic accidents; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); and drug overdose. Independent variables were male unemployment rate of the primary health care areas and indicators of extreme poverty and social conflict. A descriptive analysis, a bivariate analysis using Spearman correlation coefficients, and a multivariate analysis fitting Poisson regression models were carried out. For the main results, one group of causes of death was associated only with unemployment: bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (both men and women); lung cancer (only among men); total mortality and cirrhosis (only among women). Among men, another group of causes of death was associated with extreme poverty and/or social unrest, as well as unemployment: total mortality, cirrhosis, and drug overdose. AIDS in men was only associated with extreme poverty and social unrest. We concluded that we see different types of relationships between deprivation and mortality. Unemployment has been related to mortality because of pathologies with socially accepted risk factors (tobacco and alcohol). Causes of death with risk factors not socially accepted (illegal drug use) have been related to indicators of marginality as well as unemployment.","2004",,"J Urban Health"," The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between indicators of extreme poverty and social unrest , along with unemployment , and mortality in Barcelona , during the years 1989 to 1993 ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Bronchitis, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Cause of Death, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Liver Cirrhosis, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, TRUE, Multivariate Analysis, FALSE, Pensions, FALSE, Poverty, FALSE, Respiratory Tract Diseases, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Socioeconomic Factors, FALSE, Spain, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Unemployment, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: We evaluated the association of breast cancer with CYP1A1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking in a population-based, case-control study of invasive breast cancer in North Carolina. The study population consisted of 688 cases (271 African Americans and 417 whites) and 702 controls (285 African Americans and 417 whites). Four polymorphisms in CYP1A1 were genotyped using PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis: M1 (also known as CYP1A1*2A), M2 (CYP1A1*2C), M3 (CYP1A1*3), and M4 (CYP1A1*4)
RESULTS: No associations were observed for CYP1A1 variant alleles and breast cancer, ignoring smoking. Among women who smoked for longer than 20 years, a modest positive association was found among women with one or more M1 alleles (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-3.5) but not among women with non-M1 alleles (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.9-1.6).

The anchorage-dependent growth of these cells was decreased due to increased cell cycle arrest in S-G2/M phase; however, the surviving cells developed resistance due to an increased Bcl-xL to Bax ratio. Levels of PCNA and gadd45 proteins--involved in DNA repair in response to genomic damage--were increased, suggesting that the cells were responding to CSC-induced genomic damage. The transformation of MCF10A cells was determined by their colony-forming efficiency in soft-agar in an anchorage-independent manner. CSC-treated MCF10A cells efficiently formed colonies in soft-agar. We then re-established cell lines from the soft-agar colonies and further examined the persistence of their transforming characteristics. The re-established cell lines, when plated after 17 passages without CSC treatment, still formed colonies in the soft-agar. An increased staining of neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) further showed a transformation characteristic of MCF10A cells treated with CSC.

Considerable variation exists in cancer mortality between the sexes and among different racial/ethnic populations and geographic locations. The description of mortality data by state, sex, and race/ethnicity is essential for cancer-control researchers to target areas of need and develop programs that reduce the burden of cancer.
REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 1990-2000.
DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Mortality data from CDC were used to calculate death rates and trends, categorized by state, sex, and race/ethnicity. Trend analyses for 1990-2000 are presented for all cancer sites combined and for the four leading cancers causing death (lung/bronchus, colorectal, prostate, and breast) categorized by state, sex, and race/ethnicity. Death rates per 100,000 population for the 10 primary cancer sites with the highest age-adjusted rates are also presented for each state and the District of Columbia by sex. For males, the 10 primary sites include lung/bronchus, prostate, colon/rectum, pancreas, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, esophagus, stomach, and urinary bladder. For females, the 10 primary sites include lung/bronchus, breast, colon/rectum, pancreas, ovary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain/other nervous system, uterine corpus, and myeloma.
RESULTS: For 1990-2000, cancer mortality decreased among the majority of racial/ethnic populations and geographic locations in the United States. Statistically significant decreases in mortality among all races combined occurred with lung and bronchus cancer among men (--1.7%/year); colorectal cancer among men and women (--2.0%/year and--1.7%/year, respectively); prostate cancer (--2.6%/year); and female breast cancer (--2.3%/year). For 1990-2000, cancer mortality remained stable among American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Statistically significant increases in lung and bronchus cancer mortality occurred among women of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, except among Asian/Pacific Islanders.
INTERPRETATION: Although cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, the overall declining trend in cancer mortality demonstrates considerable progress in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: More effective tobacco-cessation programs are necessary to reduce lung and bronchus cancer mortality among women and sustain the decrease in lung and bronchus cancer mortality among men. Additional programs that deter smoking initiation among adolescents are essential to ensure future decreases in lung and bronchus cancer mortality.

We determined standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), adjusted for several variables, for cancer among men and women in four educated groups and compared them with those with less than 9 years of education. Total cancer risks did not differ much, but at individual sites, the university-educated population showed consistent, increasing or decreasing trends. The educated group showed high SIRs for melanoma and skin cancer and for female breast cancer. At all these sites, SIRs for in situ tumours exceeded those for invasive tumours; the highest SIR was 4.81 for male MD, PhDs for in situ melanoma.

Nurses are required to provide information on how to avoid cancer, and, once the diagnosis is made, how to cope with it. Prevention and early detection of the cancers described in this article are in the very early stages of knowledge development, but general health promotion guidance can be offered on how to avoid most cancers (ie, no tobacco use, a high-fiber and low fat diet, exercise, and maintaining a normal weight). Nurses also can advise patients to be screened for colorectal cancer at the appropriate ages and time intervals and to be aware as new developments occur in the scientific base for screenings in the areas of prostate, penile, and testicular cancer. Finally, coping with these forms of cancer often requires the patient to make major lifestyle and psychological changes, especially if surgery in the genital area occurs. Decreased libido, incontinence, and impotence are major complications that can occur with these illnesses. The male cancers described vary tremendously in their prevalence, incidence, mortality, treatment, and survival rates. Within this group, there are remarkably positive outcomes and outcomes much in need of improvement. Penile and testicular cancers are the bright spots in this picture; both are uncommon, and both are eminently treatable. Prostate cancer, on the other hand, is quite common, difficult to screen, difficult to treat without major sexual problems, and yet receives relatively little funding from the NIH. Although as many men die from prostate cancer as women die from breast cancer, NIH funds breast cancer research at much higher levels than prostate cancer. According to the latest data available at the NIH Web site, during the 1990s, the amount of NIH funding varied from four times more for breast cancer (1993) to 2.9 times more in 1999. For fiscal year 2002, NIH is providing $522 million in funding for breast cancer and $278 million for prostate cancer. Private foundation funds for prostate cancer are much smaller than those available for breast cancer. Both types of cancer are extremely important to address, and both should receive adequate research attention. Nurses can advocate for more funding for prostate cancer, from basic science approaches to behavioral science strategies.","2004",,"Nurs Clin North Am",," review","Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Aged, 80 and over, FALSE, Cause of Death, FALSE, Health Promotion, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Mass Screening, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasm Staging, FALSE, Nurse's Role, FALSE, Patient Care Planning, FALSE, Penile Neoplasms, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Primary Prevention, FALSE, organization & administration, Q000458, Prostatic Neoplasms, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, Risk Factors, FALSE, SEER Program, FALSE, Self-Examination, FALSE, Testicular Neoplasms, TRUE, diagnosis, Q000175, United States, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Most lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoke. Despite all that is known about the devastating effects of cigarettes, one quarter of women in the United States continue to smoke. Women are targeted in tobacco advertising, and teenage girls are often drawn to cigarette smoking under a variety of social pressures. Following the increase in smoking, the death rate from lung cancer in US women rose 600% from 1930 to 1997. Women may be more susceptible than men to the carcinogenic properties of cigarette smoke. In addition, differences in the biology of lung cancer exist between the 2 sexes with higher levels of DNA adduct formation, increased CYP1A1 expression, decreased DNA repair capacity, and increased incidence of K-ras gene mutations in women. The novel estrogen receptor beta has also been detected in lung tumors and suggests that estrogen signaling may have a biological role in tumorigenesis. Given these differences and given the enormous toll this disease has on US women, undertaking sex-specific research in lung cancer is crucial. Finally, disseminating information about this epidemic may prevent a similar epidemic in other parts of the world where women are just now becoming addicted to tobacco.","2004",,"JAMA",," review","Disease Susceptibility, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Sex Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, United States, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"15082451","Alcohol and cancer.","Pöschl G","Epidemiological data have identified chronic alcohol consumption as a significant risk factor for upper alimentary tract cancer, including cancer of the oropharynx, larynx and the oesophagus and of the liver. The increased risk attributable to alcohol consumption of cancer in the large intestine and in the breast is much smaller. However, although the risk is lower, carcinogenesis can be enhanced with relatively low daily doses of ethanol. Considering the high prevalence of these tumours, even a small increase in cancer risk is of great importance, especially in those individuals who exhibit a higher risk for other reasons. The epidemiological data on alcohol and other organ cancers is controversial and there is at present not enough evidence for a significant association. Although the exact mechanisms by which chronic alcohol ingestion stimulates carcinogenesis are not known, experimental studies in animals support the concept that ethanol is not a carcinogen but under certain experimental conditions is a cocarcinogen and/or tumour promoter. The metabolism of ethanol leads to the generation of acetaldehyde (AA) and free radicals. Evidence has accumulated that acetaldehyde is predominantly responsible for alcohol associated carcinogenesis. Acetaldehyde is carcinogenic and mutagenic, binds to DNA and proteins, destructs folate and results in secondary hyperproliferation. Acetaldehyde is produced by tissue alcohol hydrogenases, cytochrome P 4502E1 and through bacterial oxidative metabolism in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Its generation or its degradation is modulated due to functional polymorphisms of the genes coding for the enzymes. Acetaldehyde can also be produced by oral and faecal bacteria. Smoking, which changes the oral bacterial flora, and poor oral hygiene also increase acetaldehyde. In addition, cigarette smoking and some alcoholic beverages such as calvados contain acetaldehyde. Other mechanisms by which alcohol stimulates carcinogenesis include the induction of cytochrome P-4502E1, which is associated with an enhanced production of free radicals and enhanced activation of various procarcinogens present in alcoholic beverages; in association with tobacco smoke and in diets, a change in the metabolism and distribution of carcinogens; alterations in cell cycle behaviour such as cell cycle duration leading to hyperproliferation; nutritional deficiencies, such as methyl-, vitamin E-, folate-, pyridoxal phosphate-, zinc- and selenium deficiencies and alterations of the immune system eventually resulting in an increased susceptibility to certain virus infections such as hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. In addition, local mechanisms may be of particular importance. Such mechanisms lead to tissue injury such as cirrhosis of the liver, a major prerequisite for hepatocellular carcinoma. Also, an alcohol-mediated increase in oestradiols may be at least in part responsible for breast cancer risk. Thus, all these mechanisms functioning in concert actively modulate carcinogenesis leading to its stimulation.","2004",,"Alcohol Alcohol",," review","Acetaldehyde, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Animals, FALSE, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Ethanol, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, chemically induced, Q000139",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

An association between smoking and pulmonary metastases from breast cancer has been suggested by epidemiologic studies.
STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between exposure to cigarette smoke and pulmonary metastasis in a murine model of metastatic mammary cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study.
SETTING: Animal research laboratory.
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS: Female sexually mature BALB/cAnN mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Mice were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. Experimental animals were exposed to cigarette smoke in specialized exposure chambers, at concentrations chosen to approximate active cigarette smoking. Control animals were exposed to filtered air. One week after the initiation of exposures, mouse mammary tumor cells (tumor cell line 4526) were injected into the tail veins of experimental animals at one of three concentrations (50,000, 100,000, or 150,000 cells per 100 micro L). Three weeks later, the mice were killed, and pulmonary metastases were counted and measured.
RESULTS: The mean metastatic burden in the lungs was consistently greater for smoke-exposed animals at each concentration of cells injected (at 50,000 cells per 100 micro L, 9.8 vs 4.8 micro m(3), respectively [p < 0.01]; at 100,000 cells per 100 micro L, 34.5 vs 17.4 micro m(3), respectively [p < 0.10]; and at 150,000 cells per 100 micro L, 54.0 vs 31.5 micro m(3), respectively [p < 0.05]). This was largely attributable to a significant increase in the number of metastatic nodules per animal (at 50,000 cells per 100 micro L, 8.7 vs 4.8, respectively [p < 0.001]; at 100,000 cells per 100 micro L, 24.3 vs 14.0, respectively [p > 0.10]; and at 150,000 cells per 100 micro L, 42.0 vs 20.1, respectively [p < 0.02]) rather than to a change in nodule size.
CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoke exposure is associated with an increase in the total pulmonary metastatic burden in this murine model of metastatic mammary cell cancer.

,"15075010","Karachi Cancer Registry Data--implications for the National Cancer Control Program of Pakistan.","Bhurgri Y","Cancer registries play a major role in providing the data to justify establishment, implementation and monitoring of cancer control programs, therefore stability in cancer registration is of pivotal importance. An erroneous assessment of the cancer burden can have long-term negative implications for the limited health resources of a country. Thus, registries starting simultaneously with cancer control programs clearly cannot be adequate for the purpose. The Karachi Cancer Registry (KCR) is the first population-based registry of Pakistan, with 9 years proven data stability (1995-2003) for Karachi South (KS), a location with a population distribution similar to that for the country in general as regards age, gender, and religion. It also has the distinction of being the only district in the country with representation of all ethnic and socio-economic groups of the country. The primary recommended strategy for the 'National Cancer Control Program' (NCCP), Pakistan based on the assessment of eight common cancers in Karachi and the WHO estimates would be identical. A curb on the epidemic levels of tobacco and areca nut use would reduce malignancies in males by 43.7% and in females by 17.8%. WHO estimates put these figures at 45% and 18.5% for males and females respectively. Primary prevention in the form of diet control, checks on preservatives, dyes, and pesticides; protection from occupational hazards, control of biological agents and solar UV protection would help control of another half of the malignancies. Resource restrictions put high technology methods beyond the scope of Pakistan today. Early detection of cancers of accessible sites, though not an urgent requirement, would be warranted for oral, cervical and breast cancer, after sufficient capacity building, initially in the high-risk groups. In females, this could help target 47.6% (approximately half) of the malignancies and in men 13% of the total. Establishment of equitable pain control and a palliative care network throughout the country is an urgent and essential measure as more than 70% of cancer patients report with very advanced stages of malignancy. The estimated annual incident cancer cases for Pakistan, year 2000 on the basis of KCR data were 138,343 for males and 135,054 for females; approximately twice the number cited by WHO for the same year. The argument that higher KCR estimates reflect an urban catchment population may be justified, the urban: rural ratio being 2:1 in Pakistan. Evidence-based strategies, however,support the counter argument, that the rising incidence of cancer in Pakistan is primarily attributable to risk factors equally prevalent in the rural and urban areas viz. increasing tobacco use, low socio-economic conditions, dietary deficiencies and prevalence of oncogenic viruses. Pakistan has a significant cancer burden and rising trends of risk factors - it is a country in dire need of a Cancer Control Program. KCR data along with WHO estimates can form the initial framework of a NCCP in Pakistan; the lack of a national cancer registration should not deter initiatives. Benefits of an immediate, prompt and targeted implementation established today will be realized after 20-30 years. Otherwise the country should be prepared to face epidemic proportions of the disease in the next decade or two. Prerequisite 'qualification criteria' or 'sincerity of intent test' for NCCP funding by international donors should be legislation against tobacco and areca nuts in Pakistan and stringent evaluative criteria.","2004",,"Asian Pac J Cancer Prev"," Thus , registries starting simultaneously with cancer control programs clearly cannot be adequate for the purpose ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Cost of Illness, FALSE, Epidemiologic Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Forecasting, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Pakistan, FALSE, Palliative Care, FALSE, Public Policy, TRUE, Quality of Health Care, FALSE, Registries, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, World Health Organization, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Trends in mortality are also given in graphic form for 23 major countries plus the European Union as a whole over the period 1960-1999. In the European Union, total cancer mortality declined by 7% for both sexes over the last 5 years considered. The fall since the late 1980s was 10% in both sexes, corresponding to the avoidance of over 90000 deaths per year, as compared to the rates of the late 1980s. For the first time, over the last few years, some leveling of mortality was reported also in the Russian Federation, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and other Eastern European countries, although cancer rates in those areas remain exceedingly high. The overall favorable pattern of cancer mortality over recent years is largely driven by the decline of tobacco-related cancer mortality in men. However, important components of the trends are also the persistence of substantial falls in gastric cancer, mainly in Russia and Eastern Europe, the recent decline in intestinal cancer in both sexes and of breast cancer in women, together with the long-term falls in uterine (cervical) cancer, leukemias, Hodgkin's disease and other neoplasms amenable to advancements in diagnosis and treatment. Female lung cancer mortality has been declining in the Russian Federation, but is still rising in other areas of the continent. Thus, urgent intervention is needed to bring under control the tobacco-related lung cancer epidemic in European women before it reaches the high level observed in North America.

Beta carotene was added in the present work to study its anti oxidant effect on nicotine induced changes.

Known risk factors for breast cancer, which are related to the reproductive life of women, and other factors, such as inheritance and socioeconomic status, explain only about half of the breast cancer cases in the US. Ionizing radiation is a well established environmental risk factor for breast cancer. Chemicals that induce mammary cancer in rodents have served as leads for studies in humans, but occupational and environmental exposure to these chemicals have for the most part lacked association with breast cancer risk. However, there is recent evidence in rats that cadmium at very low doses acts as an estrogen mimic, indicating a need to investigate the effects of metals on breast cancer risk. Studies suggest that circadian rhythm disruption is linked with breast cancer, but too few studies have been done to be conclusive. Over the years, cigarette smoking as a risk factor for breast cancer has remained controversial. However, recent research has found passive smoke exposure to be associated with increased breast cancer risk, which is hypothesized to be accounted for on the basis of an antiestrogenic effect of smoking. Solar radiation has been noted to be associated with reduced breast cancer, supporting the hypothesis that vitamin D plays a protective role in reducing this risk. Although, most of the environmental factors discussed in this review have not been convincingly found to influence breast cancer risk, research suggests that environmental exposure in combination with genetic pre-disposition, age at exposure, and hormonal milieu have a cumulative effect on breast cancer risk.","2004",,"Breast Cancer Res Treat"," However , there is recent evidence in rats that cadmium at very low doses acts as an estrogen mimic , indicating a need to investigate the effects of metals on breast cancer risk "," review","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Environmental Exposure, TRUE, Environmental Pollutants, FALSE, poisoning, Q000506, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Sunlight, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Vitamin D, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

,"14975514","Schizophrenia and cancer: the adrenochrome balanced morphism.","Foster HD","Cancer might be expected to be more common amongst schizophrenics than the general population. They frequently live in selenium deficient regions, have seriously compromised antioxidant defense systems and chain-smoke. The available literature on the cancer-schizoprenia relationship in patients from England, Wales, Ireland, Denmark, USA and Japan, however, strongly suggests that the reverse is true. One of the authors (Hoffer) has treated 4000 schizophrenics since 1952. Only four of these patients has developed cancer. Since low cancer incidence has been recorded amongst patients treated by both conventional physicians using pharmaceuticals and by orthomolecular doctors who emphasize vitamins and minerals, it follows that this depressed cancer incidence must be related to the biochemistry of the disorder itself. Taken as a whole, therefore, the evidence seems to suggest that schizophrenics, their siblings and parents are less susceptible to cancer than the general population. These relationships seem compatible with one or more genetic risk factors for schizophrenia that offer(s) a selective advantage against cancer. There is experimental evidence that appears to support this possibility. Matrix Pharmaceuticals Inc. has received a US patent covering the composition of IntraDose Injectable Gel. This gel contains cisplatin and epinephrine (adrenaline) and is designed to be injected directly into tumour masses. Cisplatin is a very powerful oxidant which will almost certainly rapidly convert the adrenaline to adrenochrome. While the manufacturers of IntraDose consider cisplatin to be the active cytotoxic agent in IntraDose, it seems more likely that adrenochrome and its derivatives may, in fact, be more effective. IntraDose gel has undergone or is undergoing a series of Phase III open-label clinical studies, being injected into patients' tumours that have been identified as the most troublesome by their physicians. The results have been impressive for breast cancer, malignant melanoma, esophageal cancer and cancer of the head, neck and liver. The evidence suggests that there are balanced morphisms in schizophrenia that result in above normal exposure to catecholamine derivatives. Since such catecholamines are both hallucinogenic and anticarcinogenic abnormally high exposure to them simultaneously increases susceptibility to schizophrenia and reduces the probability of developing cancer. These observations have significant implications for the treatment of both illnesses.","2004",,"Med Hypotheses",,"other","Adrenochrome, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Catecholamines, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Schizophrenia, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"14973414","The effects of smoking on estradiol metabolism.","Tansavatdi K","Smoking remains a major health problem especially among women and it influences estrogen metabolism and the risk for multiple estrogen sensitive outcomes. Many indirect effects of smoking exist through the ability of the by-products to modify a variety of drugs, enzymes, and hormones. The results of several in vitro studies have shown that constituents of cigarette smoke have significant effects on production and metabolism of estrogens. In some cases, such as osteoporosis and endometrial cancer, smoking appears to attenuate the effects of estrogen. However, for other outcomes such as breast cancer, venous thromboembolic events (VTE), and coronary heart disease (CHD), the relationship between smoking and estrogen exposure is less defined. Based on the preponderance of evidence, smokers are likely to require higher doses of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to achieve comparable clinical effect to that observed in nonsmokers. However, uptitrating the dose of HRT in smokers to achieve a desired systemic level or clinical response may simultaneously increase risk for adverse effects that are primarily driven by hepatic rather than systemic exposure. The healthy benefits from smoking cessation should be expressed to women who choose to use HRT, and every effort should be made to encourage them to stop smoking so that they can be effectively treated with the lowest possible dose of HRT.","2004",,"Minerva Ginecol",," review","Adult, FALSE, Age Factors, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Clinical Trials as Topic, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Contraceptives, Oral, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Coronary Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Endometrial Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Estradiol, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogen Replacement Therapy, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009, Estrogens, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Postmenopause, FALSE, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Smoking Cessation, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE, Venous Thrombosis, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

To date, literature addressing this question has been mixed, and the question has seldom been examined in large prospective study designs.
METHODS: In a 1995 baseline survey, 116 544 members of the California Teachers Study (CTS) cohort, with no previous breast cancer diagnosis and living in the state at initial contact, reported their smoking status. From entry into the cohort through 2000, 2005 study participants were newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer associated with several active smoking and household passive smoking variables using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Irrespective of whether we included passive smokers in the reference category, the incidence of breast cancer among current smokers was higher than that among never smokers (HR = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10 to 1.57 relative to all never smokers; HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.53 relative to only those never smokers who were unexposed to household passive smoking). Among active smokers, breast cancer risks were statistically significantly increased, compared with all never smokers, among women who started smoking at a younger age, who began smoking at least 5 years before their first full-term pregnancy, or who had longer duration or greater intensity of smoking. Current smoking was associated with increased breast cancer risk relative to all nonsmokers in women without a family history of breast cancer but not among women with such a family history. Breast cancer risks among never smokers reporting household passive smoking exposure were not greater than those among never smokers reporting no such exposure.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that active smoking may play a role in breast cancer etiology and suggests that further research into the connection is warranted, especially with respect to genetic susceptibilities.","2004",,"J Natl Cancer Inst",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, California, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Confidence Intervals, FALSE, Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic, FALSE, Family Characteristics, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Follow-Up Studies, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Odds Ratio, FALSE, Pregnancy, FALSE, Pregnancy Complications, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Research Design, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Teaching, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The results have implications for public health policy formulation on disease incidence and the drivers of mortality risks. The research methodology is a fixed-effects GLS regression model of breast cancer mortality in US females age 25 and above, using 1990-1997 time-series data pooled across 50 US states and DC. The covariates are age, years schooled, family income, 'screening' mammography, insurance coverage types, race, and US census region. The regressions have strong explanatory powers. Finding education and income to be significantly and positively correlated with mortality supports the 'life in the fast lanes' hypothesis of Phelps. The policy of raising a woman's education at a given income appears more beneficial than raising her income at a given education level. The relatively higher mortality rate for Blacks suggests implementing culturally appropriate set of disease prevention and health promotion programs and policies. Mortality differs across insurance types with Medicaid the worst suggesting need for program reform. Mortality is greater for women ages 25-44 years, females 40-49 years who have had screening mammography, smokers, and residents of some US states. These findings suggest imposing more effective tobacco use control policies (e.g., imposing a special tobacco tax on adult smokers), creating a more tractable screening mammography surveillance system, and designing region-specific programs to cut breast cancer mortality risks.","2003",,"Health Care Manag Sci",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, diagnostic imaging, Q000000981, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Insurance, Health, FALSE, classification, Q000145, Mammography, FALSE, economics, Q000191, Middle Aged, FALSE, Models, Econometric, TRUE, Regression Analysis, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Socioeconomic Factors, FALSE, United States, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"14602137","Cancer incidence and mortality in Portugal.","Pinheiro PS","In this paper, we present estimates of national cancer incidence in Portugal in 1996-1998, predictions for the year 2000, and interpret the recent cancer mortality trends in light of observations from epidemiological research and risk factor patterns. In Portugal, national mortality data from vital statistics are available from 1960, while cancer registration has been mandatory since 1988, when three regional cancer registries covering the mainland of the Portuguese Republic were set up. Up until now, however, none of these registries has been able to produce data with an acceptable completeness of registration--hence this study. Mortality data from Portugal for 1996-1998 and incidence data for 1990-1995 from Vila Nova de Gaia (RVNG) (the most complete of the Portuguese cancer registries), 14 Italian registries and nine Spanish registries were assembled to produce the best possible estimates of numbers of incident cases for each age group and gender. A total of 19,880 new cancer cases are estimated to have been diagnosed among men in the year 2000, and nearly 17,000 new cancer cases in women. The most common cancer among Portuguese men in 2000 is cancer of the colorectum (3173 new cases), followed by cancers of the prostate (2973), lung (2611), stomach (2206) and urinary bladder (1360). In women, breast cancer is the most common cancer (4358) followed by cancers of the colorectum (2541), stomach (1494) and corpus uteri (1083). The overall age-standardised cancer mortality rate for men in Portugal increased steeply (1.4% annually) during the period 1988-1998, with prostate cancer (3.6% annually), colon and rectum (3.3%) and lung (2.4%) mostly contributing. Among women, the overall cancer mortality rate was stable (a non-significant decrease of approximately 0.2% per year). These remarkable results, particularly in males, demonstrate the need for a comprehensive national programme against cancer. Since the increasing epidemic of lung cancer (in men), as well as other tobacco-related cancers, is observed in Portugal, the important component of such a programme should be a nationwide tobacco control programme. Improving accessibility to highly effective diagnostic and treatment procedures for cancer in general and colorectal and prostatic cancers in particular should be a priority in the fight against cancer.","2003",,"Eur J Cancer",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Portugal, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Registries, FALSE, Survival Rate, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: From a sampling frame of 31 Aboriginal newspapers published in English from 1996-2000, 14 newspapers were randomly selected allowing for national and regional representation. Newspaper archives were searched at the National Library of Canada and articles selected if the disease terms cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS appeared in the headline, or in the first or last paragraph of the article. Articles were coded for inclusion of mobilizing information (local, distant, unrestricted, not specified, none) and content focus (scientific, human interest, commercial, other). Cancer articles were categorized by tumor site specificity. Data were analyzed by frequency, cross tabulations, and chi-square analysis.
RESULTS: Of 400 chronic disease articles, there were significantly more articles on HIV/AIDS (167 or 41.8%) and diabetes (135 or 33.8%) and few articles on cancer (56 or 14%) and cardiovascular disease (30 articles or 7.5%) (p<0.001). Slightly more than one third (36.5%) of the articles contained mobilizing information to enable readers to take further health action. Mobilizing information was virtually absent from cardiovascular (7/30 or 23%) and diabetes (29/135 or 21.5%) articles. Site specific cancer coverage differed significantly from chance (p<0.001) with 41% of the articles on breast cancer and no articles on lung or colorectal cancers.
INTERPRETATION: Given the burden of tobacco-related cardiovascular disease and cancer in Canadian Aboriginal people, the lack of coverage and limited mobilizing information in ethnic newspapers are a missed opportunity for health promotion.","2003",,"J Health Commun"," PURPOSE : To determine the volume and focus of articles on four chronic diseases in newspapers targeting First Nations , Métis , and Inuit in Canada ","other","Bibliometrics, TRUE, Canada, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cardiovascular Diseases, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208, Chronic Disease, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Diabetes Mellitus, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208, HIV Infections, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208, Humans, FALSE, Indians, North American, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Inuit, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Neoplasms, FALSE, ethnology, Q000208, Newspapers as Topic, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

In a case-only study on 282 women with breast cancer, we studied the interaction effects (ORi) between smoking habits and the gene polymorphisms of Cytochrome P450 1B1 (Val432Leu CYP1B1), Phenol-sulfotransferase 1A1 (Arg213His SULT1A1) and Catechol-O-methyltransferase (Val158Met COMT). The smokers carrying the Val CYP1B1 allele associated with a high hydroxylation activity had a higher risk of breast cancer than never smokers with the Leu/Leu genotype (ORi=2.32, 95%CI: 1.00-5.38). Also, the smokers carrying the His SULT1A1 allele associated with a low sulfation activity had a 2-fold excess risk compared to never smokers carrying Arg/Arg SULT1A1 common genotype (ORi= 2.55, 95%CI: 1.21-5.36). The His SULT1A1 allele increased the risk only in premenopausal patients. The Met COMT allele with a lower methylation activity than Val COMT did not modify the risk among smokers. The excess risk due to joint effect could result from a higher exposure to activated tobacco-compounds for women homo/heterozygous for the Val CYP1B1 allele. Also, a lower sulfation of the tobacco carcinogens among women with His SULT1A1 could increase exposure to genotoxic compounds. Alternatively, the Val CYP1B1 or His SULT1A1 allele with modified ability to metabolize estrogens could increase the level of genotoxic catechol estrogen (i.e., 4-hydroxy-estradiol) among smokers.

METHODS: The source population comprised Massachusetts residents who gave birth between 1987 and 1999 with a birth record in the Massachusetts Vital Statistics Registry. Cases were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1988 and 2000 at ages 25-55 with a record in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry. Three controls were matched to each case on maternal age, year of giving birth, and birth facility. Information on smoking, the matched factors, and potential confounders were collected from the birth certificate. The data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, women who smoked during pregnancy did not have an increased risk of breast cancer compared to women who did not smoke during pregnancy (relative risk = 1.0, 95% Confidence interval CI = 0.81-1.2). We observed no dose response relation between number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy and breast cancer risk. There was no evidence that our results were biased by misclassification from women inaccurately reporting their smoking status.

Using a joinpoint regression model, based on data from a national mortality routine reporting system in China (CHIS), time trends in mortality for 9 major cancers are analyzed. Between 1987 and 1999, the age-standardized mortality rates for all cancers combined declined slightly in rural areas but have increased since 1996 in urban areas. The mortality rates for cancers in oesophagus, stomach, cervix uteri, leukaemia (except for urban males after 1996) and nasopharynx declined, while lung cancer and female breast cancer showed significant increasing trends in both urban and rural areas and for both sexes. Cancers of the colon-rectum and liver had different trends in mortality in urban and rural populations. The trends in age-specific mortality rates suggest some different trends in the younger population, which may presage future overall trends, for example, increasing mortality from cancer of the cervix. The observed trends primarily reflect the dramatic changes in socioeconomic circumstances and lifestyles in China in the last 2 decades. Tobacco smoking remains a major problem, with increases in mortality from lung cancer. The improvements in socioeconomic status, diet and nutrition may be responsible for the declining risk of some cancers (oesophagus, stomach and nasopharynx), while increasing the risk for others (breast and colon-rectum). Screening programs (especially for cervix cancer), and more available and better facilities for cancer therapy, may have helped to reduce mortality for several cancers. The large increases in the absolute number of deaths that resulted from the increasing and aging population are much more important in determining the future cancer burden than any changes due to change in risk, emphasizing the increasing importance of cancer as a health problem in the 21st century in China.","2003",,"Int J Cancer",,"other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, China, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Registries, FALSE, statistics & numerical data, Q000706, Rural Population, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE, Survival Rate, FALSE, Time Factors, FALSE, Urban Population, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Using immunohistochemistry, the cellular distribution and the level of expression of CYP2E1 was assessed in breast tumour and surrounding tumour free (control) breast tissue in 25 pairs of samples obtained from females with infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Cells staining with the CYP2E1 antibody showed only cytoplasmic positivity with varying intensities in 100% (25/25) of tumours and 96% (24/25) of normal breast tissues. Cytoplasmic staining was present in invasive ductal carcinoma cells but not in tumour stroma.

No positive staining was detected in other non-epithelial cells such as fibroblasts in normal breast tissues. When CYP2E1 staining was assessed semiquantitatively the mean staining score values of CYP2E1 was found to be significantly higher in tumours compared to that of normal breast tissues.

Neither NAT1 slow genotype, or GSTT1 null genotype, alone or in combination with smoking, affected breast cancer risk.

Although there are a number of new leads with regard to risk factors for prostate cancer, more research is required to confirm them. There is little purpose in conducting further case-control studies of prostate cancer-particularly since the use of PSA testing has become wide-spread. Instead, future epidemiologic studies should focus on prostate tumor subclassification, in terms of method of detection, markers of biological ""aggressiveness,"" and genetic changes. Many of these new leads involve the possible influence of polymorphisms in key genes involved in important physiologic processes in the prostate. To fully explore the complexity of interrelationships between the several elements in these pathways will require large cohort studies in which blood is sampled prior to diagnosis. Such studies will be important for identifying which modifiable aspects of lifestyle (such as diet, alcohol, tobacco, physical activity) might be targeted for intervention, to reduce risk. The detection of early prostate cancers by PSA testing relatives of men with prostate cancer has affected the prevalence of phenocopies and, hence, the meaningfulness of risk estimation in prostate cancer families. Because multiple-case families form the substrate for gene hunting via linkage analysis, this phenocopy phenomenon is going to cause considerable confusion and wasted effort. Presently, men with a family history of prostate cancer can be provided with little advice in terms of preventive action. It is likely that one or more genetic mutations associated with a high risk for prostate cancer will be identified in the near future. Even so, the risks probably will be similar to those for mutations in the first two breast cancer genes--informative for very few families. It is difficult to foresee, as and when high-risk mutation carriers are identified, what advice should be offered to them: prophylactic prostatectomies seem to have less attraction than do prophylactic mastectomies for women at high risk of breast cancer. This issue becomes more complex when considering counseling on the basis of a genetic profile involving many low-risk polymorphisms. Hopefully, such genetic screening should occur only after its efficacy has been established; when there is a better understanding of prostate biology, tumor heterogeneity, and prognosis; and when there are proven treatment or prevention options available. Prevention is held to be better than cure, and there are some potentially interesting chemopreventive agents that require careful trial before public health initiatives can be promoted. Potential candidates include vitamin E, selenium, zinc, and lycopene as dietary supplements. There are other agents that may be appropriate for pharmaceutical development, including inhibitors of COX-2 and IGF-1 activity. It is important that chemoprevention trials are followed-up for a sufficient period of time and that other endpoints also are captured, because the supplementation of diets with superphysiologic doses of individual micronutrients sometimes has caused unexpected and unwanted results--for example, an 18% increase in lung cancers observed in the beta-carotene arm of the ATBC trial.","2003",,"Urol Clin North Am"," There is little purpose in conducting further case-control studies of prostate cancer-particularly since the use of PSA testing has become wide-spread "," review","Body Composition, FALSE, Diet, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Prevalence, FALSE, Prostatic Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Risk Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Only approximately 50% of the disease is associated with known risk factors including highly penetrant genes and lifestyle factors. Thus, environmental carcinogens may play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. The arylamine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) is a tobacco smoke constituent, an environmental contaminant, and a well-established bladder carcinogen in rodents and humans. In this study, we investigated the role of 4-ABP in the etiology of human breast cancer by measuring 4-ABP-DNA adducts using a monoclonal antibody based immunoperoxidase method that had been validated by comparison with gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of liver tissues from 4-ABP-treated mice. Adducts were analyzed in 150 paraffin-embedded breast tumors and in 55 adjacent normal tissues collected from cases in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. The role of polymorphisms in genes involved in the metabolism of 4-ABP including N-acetyl transferase 2 (NAT2), cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) and glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and the nucleotide excision repair gene XPD was also explored in the same patients. The mean log-transformed relative staining intensity for 4-ABP-DNA adducts was higher in normal (5.93 +/- 0.54) than in the corresponding tumor (5.44 +/- 0.62, P < 0.0001) tissues. However, a highly significant positive correlation was observed between the levels of 4-ABP-DNA in both tissues (r = 0.72, P < 0.0001). Smoking status was correlated with the levels of 4-ABP-DNA in tumor adjacent normal tissues with a significant linear trend (P = 0.04) for current, former and never smokers; adducts were not related to smoking status in tumor tissues.

Major avoidable or manageable risk factors for cancer identified from previous studies are tobacco, diet and infection. Some cancer could be prevented by controlling those risk factors. In Japan screenings for gastric cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and colo-rectal cancer have been widely conducted under the Law of Health Maintenance for the Aged. In planning and evaluating cancer control activities in Japan, it was considered useful to estimate the potential of primary and secondary prevention of cancer. The author estimated the potential of cancer prevention in Japan twice previously in 1990 and 1999. In this paper the potential of cancer prevention in Japan was re-estimated by using a different method and more recent data. From the present study it was estimated that about 25% of cancer occurrence could be prevented by control of smoking, diet and infection, about 9-15% of cancer deaths could be prevented by cancer screening, and about 6- 10 % of cancer deaths could be prevented by application of the state-of-the art diagnosis and treatment of cancer, altogether about 40-50% of cancer occurrences/deaths could be prevented if all possible measures for cancer prevention are applied to the general public and cancer patients in Japan.","2001",,"Asian Pac J Cancer Prev",,"other","NULL",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

,"12608008","Smoking, estradiol metabolism and hormone replacement therapy.","Mueck AO","Products for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the postmenopause are the second most frequently prescribed drugs in the USA. Among the women receiving this treatment many are smokers. In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), one of the largest interventional studies on HRT to date and which recently had to be discontinued, 50% of the 8,500 women on HRT had smoked before or continued to smoke during the study. Remarkably, there is little knowledge about the impact smoking has on the efficacy and side effects of HRT. However, it has been proven that, depending on the type, duration and intensity of nicotine consumption, smoking can reduce or completely cancel the efficacy of orally administered estrogens. Not only does smoking diminish the otherwise well-established beneficial effects of estrogen on hot flashes and urogenital symptoms and its positive effects on lipid metabolism, i.e. by reducing cholesterol, but smoking also specifically reduces estrogen's ability to prevent osteoporosis. The reduction or loss of therapeutic efficacy is mainly caused by dose-dependently elevated hepatic clearance, partially in conjunction with lower estrogen levels, and has been demonstrated only with oral estrogen applications. This failure of therapeutic action should not be compensated for by increasing the dose in smokers as this might result in the production of toxic, even potentially mutagenic estrogen metabolites-compounds recently associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. The favorable effects of estrogens are not lost in smokers when they are applied transdermally. This route enables low dosage and also avoids the formation of unphysiological metabolites by bypassing the liver. Women who continue to smoke despite all warnings should therefore only be treated via the transdermal route. Oral contraceptives, but not HRT, are contraindicated in elderly smokers. However, the principal conclusion of the WHI study was that the lowest dose possible should be chosen, especially in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, as is the case in smokers.","2003",,"Arzneimittelforschung",," review","Aged, FALSE, Cardiovascular System, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Drug Interactions, FALSE, Estradiol, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estrogen Replacement Therapy, TRUE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Osteoporosis, FALSE, prevention & control, Q000517, Smoking, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

METHODS: This was a prospective survey of consecutive adults seated in the ED waiting area during a representative week on predetermined shifts. The survey asked them to indicate whether they would be interested in obtaining information about the following preventive health issues: breast cancer, prostate cancer, smoking, obesity, stress reduction, exercise programs, alcohol/drugs, HIV, blood pressure screening, immunizations, referrals to primary care physicians, Pap smears, car safety, smoke detectors, domestic and youth violence, depression, gun safety, and safe sex.
RESULTS: Of the 1284 subjects approached, 878 (68%) made up the study group (56% female, mean age = 44 years, 60% white); 406 refused. The information people were most interested in obtaining was the following: 52% of the respondents were interested in referral to stress reduction programs, 51% in information about exercise programs, 42% in blood pressure screening, 40% in information about breast cancer screening, 33% in depression information/screening, 33% in prostate cancer screening, 26% in immunization against pneumococcus, 24% in immunization against tetanus, 26% in smoking cessation programs, and 26% in safe driving information.

,"12562662","Cancer mortality in Ireland, 1926-1995.","Boyle P","BACKGROUND: Investigation of long time series of cancer data can still be very useful in helping to identify Cancer Control priorities and achievements. Since the partition of Ireland into the independent Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom, cancer mortality data have been published in an essentially similar format in both countries. The information presented here will contribute to providing a basis for the collaborative Cancer Research programme initiated recently.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer mortality data have been assembled and analysed separately for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland: the data have then been combined to present mortality rates for the whole of Ireland, covering the period from 1926 to 1995. Several rubrics had to be aggregated to provide data continuously over the time span (e.g. colon and rectum and cervix and body of the uterus). When data were only available in 10-year classes of age, the EM algorithm was employed to obtain 5-year age-specific rates. All rates presented are age-standardised, employing the World Standard Population.
RESULTS: In women, the death rate from all neoplasms combined increased very slightly from 117 per 100 000 in 1946-1950 to 120 per 100 000 in 1991-1995. In men, the death rate increased from 127 per 100 000 to 172 per 100 000 over the same time period. The overall cancer death rate in Ireland is currently similar to the European average in men, although in women it is among the top fifth of national cancer mortality rates in European countries. While cancer is a major cause of death in Ireland, there is no evidence of an evolving epidemic building up: the death rates from most forms of cancer are declining towards the end of the time period considered.
CONCLUSIONS: As demonstrated by falling death rates from Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer, major treatment advances appear to have been incorporated effectively into clinical practice in Ireland. Progress is apparent in tobacco control and further initiatives in this area must be undertaken since tobacco appears to be the only major new carcinogen introduced recently into the Irish environment during the period covered by this study. Effective population-based screening programmes for cervix and breast cancer and, more controversially, consideration of a National Prostate Cancer Screening programme, offer scope for further improvement in mortality. Examination of this long time series of mortality data from Ireland provides information about the evolving cancer pattern and provides the necessary background to evaluate the impact of the cross-border cancer research activities now being launched.","2003",,"Ann Oncol"," Effective population-based screening programmes for cervix and breast cancer and , more controversially , consideration of a National Prostate Cancer Screening programme , offer scope for further improvement in mortality ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Female, FALSE, History, 20th Century, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Ireland, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Mortality, FALSE, trends, Q000639, Neoplasms, FALSE, history, Q000266, Preventive Medicine, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Over 80% of the relevant information worldwide on alcohol and tobacco consumption and breast cancer were collated, checked and analysed centrally. Analyses included 58,515 women with invasive breast cancer and 95,067 controls from 53 studies. Relative risks of breast cancer were estimated, after stratifying by study, age, parity and, where appropriate, women's age when their first child was born and consumption of alcohol and tobacco. The average consumption of alcohol reported by controls from developed countries was 6.0 g per day, i.e. about half a unit/drink of alcohol per day, and was greater in ever-smokers than never-smokers, (8.4 g per day and 5.0 g per day, respectively). Compared with women who reported drinking no alcohol, the relative risk of breast cancer was 1.32 (1.19-1.45, P<0.00001) for an intake of 35-44 g per day alcohol, and 1.46 (1.33-1.61, P<0.00001) for >/=45 g per day alcohol. The relative risk of breast cancer increased by 7.1% (95% CI 5.5-8.7%; P<0.00001) for each additional 10 g per day intake of alcohol, i.e. for each extra unit or drink of alcohol consumed on a daily basis. This increase was the same in ever-smokers and never-smokers (7.1% per 10 g per day, P<0.00001, in each group). By contrast, the relationship between smoking and breast cancer was substantially confounded by the effect of alcohol. When analyses were restricted to 22 255 women with breast cancer and 40 832 controls who reported drinking no alcohol, smoking was not associated with breast cancer (compared to never-smokers, relative risk for ever-smokers=1.03, 95% CI 0.98-1.07, and for current smokers=0.99, 0.92-1.05). The results for alcohol and for tobacco did not vary substantially across studies, study designs, or according to 15 personal characteristics of the women; nor were the findings materially confounded by any of these factors. If the observed relationship for alcohol is causal, these results suggest that about 4% of the breast cancers in developed countries are attributable to alcohol. In developing countries, where alcohol consumption among controls averaged only 0.4 g per day, alcohol would have a negligible effect on the incidence of breast cancer. In conclusion, smoking has little or no independent effect on the risk of developing breast cancer; the effect of alcohol on breast cancer needs to be interpreted in the context of its beneficial effects, in moderation, on cardiovascular disease and its harmful effects on cirrhosis and cancers of the mouth, larynx, oesophagus and liver.","2002",,"Br J Cancer",,"meta analysis","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Cardiovascular Diseases, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Developing Countries, TRUE, Epidemiologic Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Our aim was to assess the carcinogenic and possibly antioestrogenic effects of cigarette smoke on risk of breast cancer.
METHODS: We sent a questionnaire to 1431 women younger than age 75 years who had breast cancer and were listed on the population-based British Columbia cancer registry between June 1, 1988, and June 30, 1989. We also sent questionnaires to 1502 age-matched controls, randomly selected from the 1989 provincial voters list. We obtained information on all known and suspected risk factors for breast cancer, and on lifetime smoking, alcohol consumption, and occupational history. We assessed the effect of smoking separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal women, adjusting for confounding variables.
FINDINGS: 318 premenopausal women and 340 controls replied. Risk of breast cancer was significantly increased (adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.13-2.51) in women who had been pregnant and who started to smoke within 5 years of menarche, and in nulliparous women who smoked 20 cigarettes daily or more (7.08, 1.63-30.8) and had smoked for 20 cumulative pack-years or more (7.48, 1.59-35.2). Postmenopausal women (700 breast cancer and 685 controls) whose body-mass index increased from age 18 to current and who started to smoke after a first fullterm pregnancy had a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (0.49, 0.27-0.89).
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that cigarette smoke exerts a dual action on the breast, with different effects in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

The findings of smoking-specific DNA adducts and p53 gene mutations in the breast tissue of smokers also support the biological plausibility of a positive association between cigarette smoking and breast cancer, as does the detection of carcinogenic activity in breast fluid. However, epidemiological studies conducted over the past few decades have variably shown positive, inverse, or null associations. To help reconcile the discrepant findings, epidemiologists have paid increasing attention to measures of exposure to tobacco smoke that might be of the greatest etiological importance, to aspects of the smoker that might modify the association between smoking and breast cancer risk, and to the potentially different associations that might exist with different types of breast tumors, such as those with and without estrogen or progesterone receptors. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that smoking probably does not decrease the risk and indeed suggest that there may be an increased breast cancer risk with smoking of long duration, smoking before a first full-term pregnancy, and passive smoking.

METHODS: Deaths according to year, age, gender and municipality of residence, were ascertained from the Ministry of Health. Age-adjusted rates were calculated for specific cancer sites by gender in the five Brazilian geographic regions.
RESULTS: Lung and breast cancers were, respectively in males and females, the main causes of cancer deaths in the Brazilian population. Overall cancer mortality rates for whole country declined among males (-0.3%) and females (-4.8%). But, rates were on increase for cancers of prostate (38.3%), lung (10.5%) and, more recently, colorectal (14.5% from 1989 to 1995) in males, and for lung (26.7%), breast (9.9%) and colorectal (10.2% from 1989 to 1995) in females. Mortality rates by lung and other tobacco related cancers were higher in the Southern and Southeastern. Females in the Northern and Northeastern had more expressive mortality rates by cervical cancer than other regions, and an inverse trend was observed for breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates by all cancers were heterogeneous in Brazil. The risk of death by cancer was higher in the Southern and Southeastern regions, but was decreasing in these regions, the more developed in the country.

One genetic polymorphism (G-->A, Arg-->Gln at codon 399) occurs within a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase binding region and within the central breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 product COOH terminus domain of XRCC1. The variant 399Gln allele of XRCC1 has been associated with elevated biomarkers of DNA damage in human cells. We conducted an analysis of the Arg399Gln polymorphism in XRCC1 using genomic DNA, and questionnaire information from 309 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 964 controls that were part of a population-based, case-control study conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1994 and 2001. We genotyped individuals using a mass spectrometry-based method. Because smoking and obesity are known and suspected pancreas cancer risk factors, and have been associated with DNA damage and oxidative stress in target tissues, we estimated odds ratios (ORs), interaction contrast ratios (ICRs), and 95% confidence intervals for the combined effects of XRCC1 genotype and smoking or body mass index (in kg/m(2)). We also assessed potential gene-gene interactions between polymorphisms in XRCC1 and CYP1A1, GSTT1, and GSTM1. We found little or no evidence for an association between XRCC1 genotype and pancreatic cancer among Caucasians, African-Americans, or Asians. There was evidence for interaction between XRCC1 399Gln and smoking that was stronger among women than men. Relative to never active or passive smokers with the Arg/Arg genotype, the age- and race-adjusted ORs and ICRs (95% confidence limits) for heavy smoking (>or=41 pack-years) were: for Gln/Gln or Arg/Gln genotypes [women OR = 7.0 (2.4, 21), ICR = 3.1 (0.03, 6.2); men OR = 2.4 (1.1, 5.0), ICR = 1.3 (-0.20, 2.8)]; and for the Arg/Arg genotype [women OR = 2.2 (0.73, 6.4); men OR = 1.5 (0.68, 3.2)]. Analyses of combined genotypes suggested an interaction between XRCC1 (Gln/Gln or Arg/Gln) and GSTT1/GSTM1-null/null among women but not among men. There was no evidence of interaction between XRCC1 genotype and body mass index. Our results suggest that the XRCC1 399Gln allele is a potentially important determinant of susceptibility to smoking-induced pancreatic cancer.

Because the physicochemical composition of mainstream and sidestream smoke differ, we conducted a case-control study to assess a possible differential effect of NAT2 genotype on the relationship between active/passive smoke exposure and breast cancer risk.
METHODS: Breast cancer patients diagnosed by 50 years of age and population-sampled controls were interviewed to obtain detailed lifetime active and passive smoking history. NAT2 genotype was determined in 422 breast cancer patients and 887 controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate breast cancer risk in relation to smoking history by acetylator status and interaction effects.
RESULTS: Compared with women never regularly exposed to tobacco smoke, odds ratios (ORs) for current smoking and ex-smoking were 1.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-2.9] and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.0) in slow acetylators, and not increased in rapid acetylators. Active smoking variables, such as pack-years, duration of smoking, and time since cessation, showed significant dose-response relationships with breast cancer risk among slow acetylators but not rapid acetylators. In contrast, passive smoking was associated with higher risk in rapid than in slow acetylators, with ORs of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0-4.1) and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.0), respectively.

A substantial proportion of the Caucasian population has a homozygous deletion (null) of the GSTMI or GSTT1 gene, which results in lack of production of these isoenzymes. We conducted a case-control study in a cohort of postmenopausal Iowa women who in 1986 completed a mailed questionnaire on lifestyle factors including information on cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk factors. DNA samples and information related to charred meat intake were obtained, in the case-control study, from breast cancer cases diagnosed during 1992-1994, and a random sample of cancer-free cohort members. Included in this study were 202 cases and 481 controls who were genotyped for GSTM1 or GSTT1 gene polymorphisms. Compared to women who had both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes, a 60% elevated risk (95% CI = 1.0-2.5) was observed among those whose GSTM1 or GSTT1 gene was deleted. When stratified by meat eating habits, the risk of breast cancer associated with null GSTM1 or GSTT1 genotype was observed primarily among women who ate meats consistently well- or very well-done. Women who carried either one of the null genotypes and consumed meat consistently well- or very well-done had a 3.4-fold elevated risk of developing breast cancer (95% CI = 1.6-7.1). Cigarette smoking was not a risk factor for breast cancer among women who had either the GSTM1 or GSTT1 genes. Among those with the null GSTT1 genotype, however, a significantly elevated risk of breast cancer was associated with cigarette smoking (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.4) and the association was stronger among former (OR = 4.4, 95% CI = 1.5-12.8) than current smokers (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.4-4.1).

TAM has been shown to be an effective agent for prevention of breast cancer in women of varying degrees of risk and has been proposed to be used prophylactically in women whose genetic background suggests a high risk for breast cancer. However, it is not known whether TAM given prophylactically will alter the response of women to carcinogens from common environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke. Therefore, we studied the effects of TAM pretreatment on mammary DNA adducts of the model carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), in the female rats to assess whether TAM would alter the adduct pattern of DMBA. TAM (0.3 mg/day) was given for 7 days prior to a single 20 mg DMBA gavage treatment that is considered a carcinogenic dose in the rat. At 7 days post-DMBA, there was a reduction in the major DMBA-DNA adduct and a significant reduction in the minor DMBA-DNA adduct in mammary glands (P=0.002) of TAM pretreated rats compared to control rats. These data indicate that TAM may alter either metabolic steps in the formation of DNA binding species and/or enhance adduct removal.

However, if colorectal cancer develops only after an induction period of about 35 years, as has been proposed recently, then studies in which all subjects have fewer than about 35 years between smoking commencement and assessment of outcome would be unlikely to detect this association. Few studies have examined smoking of several decades' duration among women. Therefore, in the cohort study reported here, we used proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios relating cigarette smoking to colorectal cancer risk among 89,835 women aged 40-59 years at recruitment into the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, a randomized controlled trial of mammography screening for breast cancer. During an average 10.6 years of follow-up (936,433 person-years), a total of 527 women were diagnosed with incident colorectal cancer (363 colon and 164 rectal). We found that smoking was associated with increased risk of rectal cancer 30 years or more after commencement, and especially with smoking of 40 years' duration or longer (hazard ratio=3.14, 95% CI=1.33-7.42). There was little evidence for altered risk of colon cancer.

Many epidemiological studies have provided evidence that women are more susceptible than men to the adverse effects of tobacco smoke. These observations suggest the possible role of estrogens in lung carcinogenesis. We report here the expression of mRNA for estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) in cultured human non-small cell lung cancer cells, cultured lung fibroblasts, and primary cultures of normal bronchial epithelium. Western analysis of ERalpha suggested that the main protein expressed in lung tumor cells is a variant, probably attributable to alternative splicing. Protein for ERbeta was found to be a mixture of full-length as well as alternatively spliced variants. beta-Estradiol produced a proliferative response in vitro in both normal lung fibroblasts and cultured non-small cell lung tumor cells. This effect was also observed in vivo. In this regard, beta-estradiol stimulated growth of the non-small cell lung tumor line, H23, grown as tumor xenografts in SCID mice. This effect was blocked by fluvestrant (ICI 182,780). In paraffin sections of non-small cell lung tumors, ERbeta immunoreactivity was localized to the nucleus, whereas ERalpha immunoreactivity was mainly localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that both nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling may be involved in estrogenic responses in the lung. To show that the ERs found in the lung are functional, we demonstrated that beta-estradiol stimulated transcription of an estrogen response element-luciferase construct transfected in non-small cell lung tumor cell lines. Antiestrogens blocked this effect. Treatment of lung fibroblasts with beta-estradiol also increased secretion of hepatocyte growth factor by 2-fold. These results suggest that estrogen signaling plays a biological role in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme in the lung and that estrogens could potentially promote lung cancer, either through direct actions on preneoplastic or neoplastic cells or through indirect actions on lung fibroblasts. Additionally, it is possible that antiestrogens may have therapeutic value to treat or prevent lung cancer.","2002",,"Cancer Res",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cell Division, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Estradiol, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Estrogen Receptor Modulators, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Estrogen Receptor alpha, FALSE, Estrogen Receptor beta, FALSE, Fibroblasts, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Humans, FALSE, Immunocompromised Host, FALSE, Immunohistochemistry, FALSE, Lung, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Mice, FALSE, RNA, Messenger, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Receptors, Estrogen, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Transcription, Genetic, FALSE, drug effects, Q000187, Tumor Cells, Cultured, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Prevention would be the most efficient way of eradicating this disease. This goal, however, cannot be accomplished until the specific agent(s) or mechanisms that initiate the neoplastic process are identified. Experimental studies have demonstrated that mammary cancer is a hormone-dependent multistep process that can be induced by a variety of compounds and mechanisms, that is, hormones, chemicals, radiation, and viruses, in addition to or in combination with genetic factors. Although estrogens have been shown to play a central role in breast cancer development, their carcinogenicity on human breast epithelial cells (HBECs) has not yet been clearly demonstrated. Breast cancer initiates in the undifferentiated lobules type 1, which are composed of three cell types: highly proliferating cells that are estrogen-receptor negative (ER-), nonproliferating cells that are ER positive (ER+), and very few (<1%) ER+ cells that proliferate. Interestingly, endogenous 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme isoforms CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, which also activate benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a carcinogen contained in cigarette smoke. We postulate that if estrogens are carcinogenic in HBECs, they should induce the same transformation phenotypes induced by chemical carcinogens and ultimately genomic changes observed in spontaneously developing primary breast cancers. To test this hypothesis we compared the transforming potential of E(2) on the HBEC MCF-10F with that of B[a]P. Both E(2) and B[a]P induced anchorage-independent growth, colony formation in agar methocel, and loss of ductulogenic capacity in collagen gel, all parameters indicative of cell transformation. In addition, the DNA of E(2)-transformed cells expressed LOH in chromosome 11 at 11q23.3, 11q24.2-q25, and LOH at 13q12-q13. B[a]P-induced cell transformation was also associated with LOH at 13q12-q13 and at 17p13.2.

Studies in humans demonstrate that tobacco constituents can reach breast tissue. The uptake and metabolic activation of mammary carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 4-aminobiphenyl are frequently higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. Although it is likely that specific mammary carcinogens in tobacco smoke can reach breast tissue, evidence is lacking at the present time. Some PAHs present in cigarette smoke can be metabolized to sterically hindered diol epoxides, which are potent mammary carcinogens. Thus, compounds such as benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]P), not classically considered to be a strong carcinogen in rodents, could nevertheless be metabolized in humans to diol epoxides carcinogenic to the breast.

Large numbers of women continue to smoke, and new smokers are almost as likely to be female as male. Lung cancer is still a largely incurable disease; annual lung-cancer mortality in women exceeds that of breast cancer, and lung cancer now accounts for 12% of all new female cancer cases. The results of several studies suggest that women are more susceptible than men to lung cancer and to conditions that predispose to this cancer, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is still much controversy about whether there is an increased lung-cancer risk in women across all populations.

Women may be particularly at risk. The purpose of our study was to assess differences in the likelihood of exposure to ETS at home and at work among an ethnically diverse sample of women age 40 and older in the United States. We used data from the U.S. Women's Determinants Study and restricted the sample to include only nonsmoking women (n = 2326). Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for exposure to ETS by sociodemographic characteristics, health risk behaviors, and the type of workplace smoking policy were calculated using logistic regression. Exposure to ETS at home was associated with being American Indian/Alaska Native (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0, 2.6), age 40-44 (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0, 2.6) and 45-54 (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2, 2.6), having eighth grade (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3, 3.6) or high school education (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4, 3.3), inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0, 2.1), and not getting screened for breast cancer (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1, 2.0). Women who did not have regular breast (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.9, 1.9) and cervical (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5, 5.3) cancer screening were more likely to be exposed to ETS at work.

METHODS: Data and statistics for 1997 subdivided into 31 cancer sites are presented. Trends in age-standardized rates for major cancer sites are plotted from 1955 to 1997.
RESULTS: The age-standardized (world standard) death certification rates from all neoplasms steadily declined from the peak of 199.2/100,000 males in 1988 to 174.7 in 1997 and for females from 102.5 to 93.0. The decline was larger in truncated rates, by about 26% for males since 1983 and by 24% for females since the top rate of the early 1960's. A major component of the favorable trend in males was lung cancer, which showed a 16% decline from the peak of 1987-88, to reach 50.6/100,000 in 1997, corresponding to about 5,000 avoided deaths. The decline in lung cancer was about 34% at age 35 to 64. For females, in contrast, both the absolute number of lung cancer deaths and the age-standardized rate of 7.9/100,000 were among the highest values ever registered, reflecting the different pattern of spread of the tobacco-related lung cancer epidemic in the two sexes. Intestinal cancer rates were stable for males but declined by approximately 10% for females, mostly in middle age, as did breast cancer mortality. Among neoplasms showing favorable trends, there were other tobacco-related neoplasms in men, plus the continuing fall in stomach and cervix uteri. Upward trends were observed for non Hodgkin's lymphomas.
CONCLUSIONS: The fall in cancer mortality observed over the last decade in Italy is attributable to a decline in lung and other tobacco-related neoplasms in males, together with a persistent fall in stomach and uterine (cervical) cancer. In women, there were also recent falls in intestinal and breast cancer rates, and declines in both sexes in rarer neoplasms influenced by therapeutic advancements.","2001",,"Tumori"," AIMS AND BACKGROUND : To update data and statistics on cancer death certification in Italy to 1997 ","other","Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Italy, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Time Factors, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"11750846","Estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Europe in 1995.","Bray F","Cancer incidence and mortality estimates for 1995 are presented for the 38 countries in the four United Nations-defined areas of Europe, using World Health Organization mortality data and published estimates of incidence from national cancer registries. Additional estimation was required where national incidence data was not available, and the method involved incorporating the high quality incidence and mortality data available from the expanding number of population-based cancer registries in Europe. There were an estimated 2.6 million new cases of cancer in Europe in 1995, representing over one-quarter of the world burden of cancer. The corresponding number of deaths from cancer was approximately 1.6 million. After adjusting for differing population age structures, overall incidence rates in men were highest in the Western European countries (420.9 per 100,000), with only Austria having a rate under 400. Eastern European men had the second highest rates of cancer (414.2), with extremely high rates being observed in Hungary (566.6) and in the Czech Republic (480.5). The lowest male all-cancer rate by area was observed in the Northern European countries, with fairly low rates seen in Sweden (356.6) and the UK (377.8). In contrast to men, the highest rates in women were observed in Northern Europe (315.9) and were particularly high in Denmark (396.2) and the other Nordic countries excepting Finland. The rates of cancer in Eastern European women were lower than in the other three areas, although as with men, female rates were very high in Hungary (357.2) and in the Czech Republic (333.6). There was greater disparity in the mortality rates within Europe--generally, rates were highest in Eastern European countries, notably in Hungary, reflecting a combination of poorer cancer survival rates and a higher incidence of the more lethal neoplasms, notably cancer of the lung. Lung cancer, with an estimated 377,000 cases, was the most common cancer in Europe in 1995. Rates were particularly high in much of Eastern Europe reflecting current and past tobacco smoking habits of many of its inhabitants. Together with cancers of colon and rectum (334,000), and female breast (321,000), the three cancers represented approximately 40% of new cases in Europe. In men, the most common primary sites were lung (22% of all cancer cases), colon and rectum (12%) and prostate (11%), and in females, breast (26%), colon and rectum (14%) and stomach (7%). The number of deaths is determined by survival, as well as incidence; by far the most common cause of death was lung cancer (330,000)--about one-fifth of the total number of cancer deaths in Europe in 1995. Deaths from cancers of the colon and rectum (189,000) ranked second, followed by deaths from stomach cancer (152,000), which due to poorer survival ranked higher than breast cancer (124,000). Lung cancer was the most common cause of death from cancer in men (29%). Breast cancer was the leading cause of death in females (17%). Cancer registries are a unique source of information on cancer incidence and survival, and are used here with national mortality to demonstrate the very substantial burden of cancer in Europe, and the scope for prevention. Despite some provisos about data quality, the general patterns which emerge in Europe verify the role of past exposures and interventions, and more importantly, firmly establish the need for cancer control measures which target specific populations. In particular, there is a clear urgency to combat the ongoing tobacco epidemic, now prevalent in much of Europe, particularly in the Eastern countries.","2002",,"Eur J Cancer"," Cancer registries are a unique source of information on cancer incidence and survival , and are used here with national mortality to demonstrate the very substantial burden of cancer in Europe , and the scope for prevention ","other","Adolescent, FALSE, Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Child, FALSE, Child, Preschool, FALSE, Europe, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Infant, FALSE, Infant, Newborn, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, mortality, Q000401, Registries, FALSE, Sex Distribution, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Because smoking-related DNA adducts are detectable in both normal and malignant breast tissues, we hypothesized that breast cancer patients may be sensitive to tobacco-induced carcinogenesis, and this sensitivity could be modulated by variants of metabolic genes. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide (BPDE)-induced mutagen sensitivity and polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in a pilot case-control study of breast cancer. Short-term cell cultures were established from blood samples of 100 female breast cancer patients and 105 healthy controls. After 5 h of in vitro exposure to 4 microM of BPDE, we harvested the lymphocytes for cytogenetic evaluation and recorded and compared the frequency of BPDE-induced chromatid breaks between cases and controls. We used a multiplex PCR-based assay to simultaneously detect polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 from genomic DNA. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cases had a significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks than did controls (P < 0.0001). The level of chromatid breaks greater than the median value of controls was associated with a >3-fold increased risk of breast cancer [adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) = 3.11; 95% CI = 1.72-5.64]. The risk was more pronounced in those who were < 45 years (ORadj = 4.79; 95% CI = 1.87-12.3), ever-smokers (ORadj = 5.55; 95% CI = 1.85-16.6), alcohol drinkers (ORadj = 4.64; 95% CI = 1.70-12.7), and those who had the GSTT1 null variant (ORadj = 8.01; 95% CI = 1.16-55.3).

Anthropometric measures, such as body mass index (BMI) or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) do not seem to influence total IGF-I concentrations in peripheral blood, but may modulate IGF-I bioavailability through insulin-dependent changes in IGFBP-1 and -2 concentrations. Age at menarche, phase of the menstrual cycle at blood draw, parity, menopause, past oral contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy use, and tobacco smoking do not appear to exert an independent effect on IGF-I and its binding proteins.

Among these genes, we have identified the S100A2 gene, which encodes a nuclear calcium-binding protein, as being down-regulated in the 1170-I cells. Because this gene has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, we examined its potential role as a tumor suppressor in lung carcinogenesis. Levels of S100A2 transcript and protein, which were high in NHBE cells, decreased by up to 50% in immortalized HBE cells (BEAS-2B and 1799) and to low to nearly undetectable levels in transformed (1198) and tumorigenic (1170-I) HBE cells. Furthermore, S100A2 mRNA and protein were undetectable in 8 and expressed at a reduced level in 3 of 11 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Positive immunohistochemical staining of S100A2 was detected in the majority (75-83%) of normal and hyperplastic lung tissues, whereas it was detected in <10% of metaplastic lung tissues, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. Treatment of 1170-I HBE and NSCLC cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in partial restoration of S100A2 expression in seven of eight cell lines. Indeed, CpG methylation was detected in the promoter region of the S100A2 gene. Our results suggest that S100A2 expression is suppressed early during lung carcinogenesis, possibly by hypermethylation of its promoter, and that its loss may be a contributing factor in lung cancer development or a biomarker of early changes in this process.","2001",,"Cancer Res",,"other","Animals, FALSE, Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic, FALSE, pharmacology, Q000494, Azacitidine, FALSE, analogs & derivatives, Q000031, Base Sequence, FALSE, Biomarkers, Tumor, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Bronchi, FALSE, cytology, Q000166, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Cell Line, Transformed, FALSE, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Chemotactic Factors, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Decitabine, FALSE, Epithelial Cells, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Mice, FALSE, Mice, Nude, FALSE, Molecular Sequence Data, FALSE, Neoplasm Staging, FALSE, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, FALSE, RNA, Neoplasm, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Rats, FALSE, S100 Proteins, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Transplantation, Heterologous, FALSE, Tumor Cells, Cultured, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

Since 1980, 3 million women have died prematurely from smoking-related diseases and injuries. Lung cancer mortality rates among U.S. women have increased about 600% since 1950, and now lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, having surpassed breast cancer in 1987. Although the report documents the devastating impact of the tobacco epidemic among women, a growing arsenal of science-based recommendations for implementing comprehensive tobacco control programs suggests that achieving the nation's ambitious Healthy People 2010 objectives, including cutting in half the rates of smoking among women and girls, is within our reach. While states continue to debate the use of tobacco settlement funds, it is important to note that when significant resources have been devoted to the implementation of evidence-based strategies, the results have been dramatic for the population overall and for women in particular. For example, in California, which has had a comprehensive tobacco control program for 11 years, smoking prevalence has declined throughout the 1990s at rates two or three times faster than in the rest of the country, and while lung cancer incidence rates increased by 13% among women in other parts of the United States, they decreased by 4.8% among women in California.

Implications for cancer control prioritization efforts.","Feldman GE","BACKGROUND: Recent genetic susceptibility findings in Jews of Eastern European descent, commonly called Ashkenazi Jews, have led to concerns that they may be stigmatized as being more cancer prone than other groups.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that site-specific or all-cancer incidence and mortality rates are higher than expected in Ashkenazi Jews worldwide when compared with referent populations.
METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed using keywords ""Jews,"" ""cancer,"" ""incidence"" and ""mortality"" to identify studies directly relevant to the primary study question.
RESULTS: Little evidence suggested that all-cancer incidence or mortality is higher in Ashkenazi Jews than in North American non-Hispanic whites. Ashkenazi Jewish men appear to have relatively low cancer rates, which may be due to lower tobacco use. Colorectal cancer was shown to disproportionately overburden Ashkenazi Jews, who may also be at increased risk for ovarian, pancreatic and stomach cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Little evidence was found supporting an elevated risk of breast cancer in Ashkenazi Jewish women. Rates of lung, cervical, penile and prostate cancers appear low in this population. Rate disparities were generally attributed to lifestyle differences, particularly diet and tobacco use, rather than to genetic predisposition.
CONCLUSIONS: Ashkenazi Jews do not appear to have a higher total cancer burden than comparable North American populations. Any cancer rate differentials in this group are more likely to be related to lifestyle and dietary factors than to genetics. However, colorectal cancer rates in Ashkenazi Jews may be the highest of any ethnic group in the world and cancer controllers should consider this when developing future screening, diagnostic and policy strategies.","2001",,"Isr Med Assoc J"," OBJECTIVE : To examine the hypothesis that site-specific or all-cancer incidence and mortality rates are higher than expected in Ashkenazi Jews worldwide when compared with referent populations ","other","Humans, FALSE, Jews, TRUE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Risk Factors, FALSE, United States, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

RESULTS: In comparison with adjusted estimates for the US female population, lesbians/bisexual women exhibited greater prevalence rates of obesity, alcohol use, and tobacco use and lower rates of parity and birth control pill use. These women were also less likely to have health insurance coverage or to have had a recent pelvic examination or mammogram.

Since genetic factors such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as reproductive history constitute only 30% of the cause, environmental exposure may play a significant role in the development of breast cancer. Likewise, the relevant enzymes involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics (from tobacco smoke, diet or other environmental sources) might play a role in breast carcinogenesis. Since individuals with modified ability to metabolize these carcinogens could have a different risk for breast cancer, we investigated the role of cytochromes P-450 (CYP1A1, CYP2D6), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1) and N-acetyltransferases (NAT1, NAT2) gene variants in breast carcinogenesis. A case-control study was conducted on 149 women with breast carcinoma and 207 healthy controls, both of French-Canadian origin. The CYP1A1*4 allele was found to be a significant risk determinant of breast carcinoma (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.7), particularly among post-menopausal women (OR = 4.0, 95% CI 1.2-13.8). The frequency of NAT2 rapid acetylators was increased among smokers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 0.8-8.2), while the NAT1*10 allele conferred a 4-fold increase in risk among women who consumed well-done meat (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.0-18.9).

While cigarette smoking may be associated with breast cancer, smokeless tobacco use has never been evaluated as a breast cancer risk factor. This study explores such an association.
METHODS: A complete census was carried out among Eastern Band Cherokee women aged 18 years and older, residing on tribal lands in western North Carolina. Self-reported alcohol, cigarette and smokeless tobacco use, demographic information, and personal history of breast cancer (stratified by age of onset < 55 years or > or = 55 years) were obtained by questionnaire.
RESULTS: 1,070 out of 1,408 (76%) eligible women were interviewed. Current and former smokeless tobacco use was common (6% and 21%, respectively). Five cases of breast cancer were identified in women under the age of 55 years and 3 cases were found in women at > or = 55 years. Only the odds ratio (OR) for younger-onset breast cancer among ever-users of smokeless tobacco was significantly elevated (OR = 7.79, 95% CI = 1.05-66.0). While the ORs for younger onset breast cancer were elevated among ever-smokers or women reporting at least monthly alcohol use, these were not significant (OR 8.49, 95% CI = 0.09-200; and OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 0.19-15.2, respectively). No ORs were significantly elevated for breast cancer among older women.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data are the first to document an apparent relationship between smokeless tobacco use and breast cancer risk, but should be confirmed in other studies due to the small number of cases.

Some studies suggest that this is due to a more advanced stage at diagnosis, on average. Our present aim was to assess whether smoking is associated with other prognostic markers as well, e.g., hormone receptor status, histopathology and tumour differentiation. The evaluation was based on 268 incident cases in a cohort of 10,902 women (35% smokers) followed for an average of 12.4 years. An immunohistochemical method on recuts of tumour tissue was used to assess hormone receptor status. One pathologist classified all tumours according to the WHO system, Nottingham grade and Nottingham Prognostic Index. The relative risk (RR) of oestrogen receptor-negative tumours was, for current smokers, 2.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-3.96] and, for ex-smokers, 2.67 (95% CI 1.41-5.06) compared to never-smokers. Ex-smokers had an increased risk of progesterone receptor-negative tumours (RR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.07-2.41), but there were no other significant associations between smoking habits and oestrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive or -negative tumours. The incidence of Nottingham grade III tumours was higher in ex-smokers than in never-smokers (RR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.17-3.54).

A comparison of two modes of data collection.","Duell EJ","PURPOSE: Farming is associated with exposure to many potential hazards including pesticides and other agents, but the quality of self-reported data on farm exposures has not been well studied.
METHODS: The reproducibility of self-reported farming history was evaluated among women in a population-based, case-control study of breast cancer in North Carolina. Thirty cases and 31 controls were randomly re-interviewed by telephone an average of 13.8 months after the initial interview. The initial interview was based on a farm-by-farm questionnaire, while the repeat interview was based on a shorter ever/never questionnaire. Agreement was estimated using proportions in exact agreement, kappa (kappa), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).
RESULTS: In general, group prevalences and means were higher on re-interview. Kappa estimates ranged from 0.15 to 0.84 among cases, and 0.26 to 0.87 among controls, with most estimates falling between 0.5 and 0.8. Moderate to almost perfect agreement (kappa) was observed for questions on crop work (0.47-0.70), crop type (0.56-0.82), pesticide application to tobacco (0.77), and farm residence (0.84). ICC estimates for continuous variables showed fair to substantial agreement (0.30 to 0.69 among cases, 0.38 to 0.69 among controls). Older cases, less educated cases, cases who lived on more than one farm, and cases with longer time intervals between interviews gave lower total agreement than similar groups of controls.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The well-documented factors in lifestyle and environment causing cancer in Denmark were identified from the IARC Monograph series. The population attributable risk per cent (PAR%) and the annual number of preventable cancers were calculated for each aetiology and cancer type around the year 2000.
RESULTS: A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix is potentially avoidable, whereas only a small proportion of breast and colorectal cancers is preventable on the given knowledge. The main causative factors include active and passive smoking, alcohol intake, exposure to asbestos and other occupational carcinogens, solar and ionising radiation, obesity, human papillomavirus infection in the female genital tract, and infection with Helicobacter pylori. More than 5000 cancers in men and almost 3500 in women annually in Denmark could have been avoided by eliminating exposure to these known carcinogens. This is equivalent to 39% and 23% of all cancers occurring respectively in men and women, around the year 2000. Smoking habits account for more than half of these avoidable cases.
DISCUSSION: The incidence of cancer could be greatly reduced through primary prevention, especially of tobacco smoking, which is the major single factor. A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix are potentially avoidable. More research in the field of aetiological factors causing female breast cancer and colorectal cancer is much needed in order to be able to prevent these types of cancer.","2001",,"Ugeskr Laeger"," The aim of the study was to estimate the preventable potential of various types of cancer in Denmark on the basis of present knowledge ","other","Alcohol Drinking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Carcinogens, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Denmark, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Environmental Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Epidemiologic Methods, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Life Style, FALSE, Male, FALSE, Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Occupational Exposure, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

,"11181440","Single nucleotide polymorphisms, metabolic activation and environmental carcinogenesis: why molecular epidemiologists should think about enzyme expression.","Williams JA","This commentary was written to stimulate thoughts on, and consideration of, enzyme expression data in target organs when investigating possible associations between polymorphisms in carcinogen activation enzymes, lifestyle/dietary factors and cancer risk. The lung and breast are taken as examples. There is overwhelming evidence for a genotoxic mechanism in lung cancer development, and compelling evidence for the contribution of genotoxins to breast cancer aetiology. A consistent association has been shown where lung cancer risk is decreased by a G-->A polymorphism in the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene, which is expressed in neutrophils recruited to the lung after chemical or immunological insults. In the breast, a consistent lack of association has been observed for women who are fast N:-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2) acetylators consuming cooked meat. This could be explained by the lack of detectable NAT2-associated sulfamethazine acetylation activity in cytosols prepared from mammary tissue, suggesting a minor contribution to carcinogen activation. The recent identification in mammary cytosols of detectable sulfotransferase isoforms (SULT1A1 and SULT1A3), which have high catalytic efficiency for activating N:-hydroxylated heterocyclic amines (HCAs, mutagens in cooked meat), offers a more important role for these enzymes in the metabolic activation of genotoxins in the breast. The possible contribution of MPO and lactoperoxidase enzymes to carcinogen activation in mammary tissue is also considered. Sulfotransferases and peroxidases have wide substrate specificity in terms of carcinogen activation (HCAs, aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-all present in cooked meat and tobacco smoke) compared with NATs (HCAs and aromatic amines only). For gene-environment interactions, investigations into functional polymorphisms in SULT and peroxidase genes may, therefore, offer new evidence for the involvement of genotoxins in the initiation of carcinogenesis. Identification of the isoforms (if any) of carcinogen activation enzymes that are expressed in the organs of interest will help to determine which genes to investigate in these studies.","2001",,"Carcinogenesis"," Identification of the isoforms ( if any ) of carcinogen activation enzymes that are expressed in the organs of interest will help to determine which genes to investigate in these studies "," review","Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Biotransformation, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Carcinogens, Environmental, FALSE, toxicity, Q000633, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Enzyme Activation, FALSE, physiology, Q000502, Enzymes, FALSE, biosynthesis, Q000096, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Male, FALSE, Molecular Epidemiology, FALSE, Peroxidase, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Risk Factors, FALSE, Sulfotransferases, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The principal cancers in males were tobacco-related - lung (age-standardised incidence rate (ASR) 61.6), bladder (ASR 11.0) and larynx (ASR 10.6), consistent with the high prevalence of smoking, and use of traditional high-tar tobaccos. Skin cancers were also relatively common (ASR 11.5 for cancers excluding melanoma). Gastrointestinal cancers were relatively rare. In women, breast cancer was by far the most common malignancy (ASR 24.4); cervical cancer was relatively rare (ASR 5.4).

,"11036112","Passive smoking exposure and female breast cancer mortality.","Wartenberg D","BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported positive associations between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and increased risk of breast cancer. However, studies of active smoking and risk of breast cancer are equivocal and in general do not support a positive association. To try to resolve this paradox, we examined the association between breast cancer mortality and potential ETS exposure from spousal smoking in an American Cancer Society prospective study of U.S. adult women.
METHODS: We assessed breast cancer death rates in a cohort of 146 488 never-smoking, single-marriage women who were cancer free at enrollment in 1982. Breast cancer death rates among women whose husbands smoked were compared with those among women married to men who had never smoked. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to control for potential risk factors other than ETS exposure.
RESULTS: After 12 years of follow-up, 669 cases of fatal breast cancer were observed in the cohort. Overall, we saw no association between exposure to ETS and death from breast cancer (rate ratio [RR] = 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8-1.2). We did, however, find a small, not statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer mortality among women who were married before age 20 years to smokers (RR = 1. 2; 95% CI = 0.8-1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the results of previous studies, this study found no association between exposure to ETS and female breast cancer mortality. The results of our study are particularly compelling because of its prospective design as compared with most earlier studies, the relatively large number of exposed women with breast cancer deaths, and the reporting of exposure by the spouse rather than by proxy.","2000",,"J Natl Cancer Inst",,"other","Age Factors, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, American Cancer Society, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Marital Status, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Proportional Hazards Models, FALSE, Prospective Studies, FALSE, Risk, FALSE, Spouses, FALSE, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, United States, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

They do have a lot in common: similar political systems, same standard of living, and even a common language root for a large part of the population. The Nordic countries have collaborated quite closely after the Second World War in fields like the labour market, pension rights and passport control. However, the health status has varied considerably during the twentieth century, even though death rates from some of the most common diseases such as cardiovascular disease are starting to converge.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vital statistics have been compared with regard to some common diseases. The differences are described according to current knowledge on preventive programmes such as breast cancer screening and screening for cardiovascular risk. The prevalence of some lifestyle variables such as alcohol, smoking, physical activity and fat consumption are reported.
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Lung cancer and cancer of the stomach still show substantial variation between the countries. Both discrepancies and similarities must be related to lifestyle, culture, politics and to some extent genetics. The five countries have their own viewpoints on tobacco, alcohol and nutrition policy, with the Danes the more liberal, and Swedes, Finns and Norwegians pursuing a stricter policy. These differences are to some extent reflected in the incidence of lung cancer, which are more positive in Finland, and the high death rates from liver cirrhosis in Denmark.

We did observe an interesting association between PTS and the development of a noncholestatic elevation of transaminases. Of PTS patients treated with prednisone therapy for a median of 105.5 days (range, 44-300 days), 91% achieved resolution of their PTS without pulmonary sequelae. At 3 years, the overall survival (OS) of stage II or III patients who developed PTS was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73%-95%); of metastatic breast cancer patients with PTS, the OS was 58% (95% CI, 38%-78%). These values were not significantly different from those of patients who did not develop PTS (91% [95% confidence interval [CI], 81%-100%] and 53% [95% CI, 32%-74%], respectively). No significant differences in disease-free or event-free survival were observed between patients with and without PTS. The incidence of PTS in breast cancer patients treated with a BCNU-containing HDC regimen can be remarkably high.

N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme activity is believed to play a role in the activation of tobacco smoke carcinogens. We examined the effect of NAT2 genetic polymorphisms on risk of breast cancer from active and passive smoking. Women were recruited from those who had suspicious breast masses detected clinically and/or mammographically. Questionnaire data were collected prior to biopsy diagnosis to blind subjects and interviewers. Histopathology showed 113 cases with mammary carcinoma (30 carcinoma in situ) and 278 controls with benign breast disease. NAT2 genotype was determined using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction amplification to detect slow acetylator mutations. Effects of passive and active tobacco smoke and of NAT2 genotype on breast cancer risk were examined with logistic regression controlling for known risk factors. Models first included all controls, and subsequently 107 with no or low risk (normal breast or no hyperplasia), and finally 148 with high risk (hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, complex fibroadenomas). Referents had no active or passive smoke exposure. We found no association between breast cancer risk and NAT2, smoking status (never, former, current), smoking duration, or cigarettes per day. There were no effects of passive exposure among never-smokers. Models were unchanged across control groups. There were no statistical interactions between tobacco smoke exposure and NAT2. The results were similar when restricting the analysis to invasive cancers. These findings do not support the hypothesis that NAT2 is a risk factor for breast cancer or that it alters susceptibility to tobacco smoke.","2000",,"Pharmacogenetics",,"other","Adult, FALSE, Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Likelihood Functions, FALSE, Logistic Models, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, TRUE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1970 and December 1990, 1,029 breast cancer patients at our institution underwent LRT. A cohort of 1,387 breast cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment by mastectomy (MAST), and who did not receive postoperative radiation during the same time period, served as a comparison group. Second malignancies were categorized as contralateral breast versus nonbreast. In the cohort of patients undergoing LRT, a detailed analysis was carried out with respect to age, disease stage, smoking history, radiation therapy technique, dose, the use of chemotherapy or hormone therapy, and other clinical and/or pathologic characteristics.
RESULTS: As of March 1999, the median follow-up was 14.6 years for the LRT group and 16 years for the MAST group. The 15-year risk of any second malignancy was nearly identical for both cohorts (17.5% v 19%, respectively). The second breast malignancy rate at 15 years was 10% for both the MAST and LRT groups. The 15-year risk of a second nonbreast malignancy was 11% for the LRT and 10% for the MAST group. In the subset of patients 45 years of age or younger at the time of treatment, the second breast and nonbreast malignancy rates at 15 years were 10% and 5% for patients undergoing LRT versus 7% and 4% for patients undergoing mastectomy (P, not statistically significant). In the detailed analysis of LRT patients, second lung malignancies were associated with a history of tobacco use. There were fewer contralateral breast tumors in patients undergoing adjuvant hormone therapy, although this did not reach statistical significance. The adjuvant use of chemotherapy did not significantly affect the risk of second malignancies.
CONCLUSION: There seems to be no increased risk of second malignancies in patients undergoing LRT using modern techniques, compared with MAST. Continued monitoring of these patient cohorts will be required in order to document that these findings are maintained with even longer follow-up periods. With nearly 15 years median follow-up periods, however, these data should be reassuring to women who are considering LRT as a treatment option.","2000",,"J Clin Oncol"," PURPOSE : To determine the risk of second malignancies after lumpectomy and radiation therapy ( LRT ) , and to compare it with that in a similar cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy without radiation ( MAST ) ","other","Adult, FALSE, Aged, FALSE, Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, radiotherapy, Q000532, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Mastectomy, Radical, TRUE, Mastectomy, Segmental, TRUE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Neoplasms, Second Primary, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Radiotherapy, Adjuvant, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

The opinion of various groups concerned, either as health professionals or as representatives of the general population, was gathered to identify the health determinants and health problems perceived as most important, to clarify the reasons for these choices, and to recommend interventions to be undertaken in order to improve the situation in the identified priority areas. Five panels, including health professionals as well as selected leaders of community groups with no direct involvement in health, were given the opportunity to reply to two rounds of questionnaires. There was a high convergence of opinion on health determinants and problems to be given priority between panels and between the first and second round. Priorities identified are mainly physical problems (cardiovascular disease, respiratory and breast cancer, AIDS, injuries due to road accidents, chronic back pain), psychosocial disorders (depression, suicide, violence in the family, stress), and problems of substance abuse (alcohol and tobacco). Unemployment and social isolation were chosen because of their perceived impact on health. Very few interventions were proposed in the medical technical or research areas. This may be due partly to the fact that good quality care is widely available and accessible in Geneva, whereas preventive programmes have not received enough attention in the past. Through the identified priorities and the proposed activities, a new vision of health emerges which gives more importance to psychosocial problems and the social environment. In this context, health promotion is seen as essential, acknowledging that sustained change in individual behaviours can only occur if the social and cultural context is taken into consideration. In conclusion, the results of this survey show that the Delphi method is a useful tool to reach consensus on health priorities and corresponding activities among a variety of actors.","2000",,"Soc Sci Med",,"other","Delphi Technique, TRUE, Health Behavior, FALSE, Health Priorities, TRUE, Health Promotion, FALSE, Health Status, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Switzerland, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"

To identify a set of robust health priorities an original approach was used triangulating results between three methods.
METHODS: The study calculated potential years of life lost, disability adjusted years of life lost, and conducted a Delphi survey to gather the opinion of health professionals and the general public.
MAIN RESULTS: Several health conditions were unanimously selected by all three methods as top priorities: cardiovascular diseases, AIDS, respiratory cancer, breast cancer for women, suicide and traffic accidents. In addition, two determinants-alcohol abuse and tobacco abuse-for which a clear conceptual link could be established between all methods were chosen. Connections between priorities identified through the DALY and the Delphi method lead to further inclusion of chronic back pain and depression. Some issues solely identified through the Delphi survey were included as they were consistently considered important by professionals and the lay public alike-violence in the family, unemployment, social exclusion.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that health priorities, and by extension health care priorities, would benefit from using a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods.

To further explore that possibility we examined the relationships of cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure, and medical treatment with ionizing radiation during adolescence with subsequent breast cancer risk.
METHODS: Data from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a population-based, case-control study of breast cancer in North Carolina women aged 20-74 years (864 cases, 790 controls), were analyzed.
RESULTS: A modest increase in breast cancer risk was suggested for women who began to smoke cigarettes between the ages of 10 and 14 years (OR: 1.5, CI: 0.9-2.5), and for women exposed to ionizing radiation between ages 10 and 19 years to treat or monitor a medical condition (OR: 1.6, CI: 0.5-2.5).

However, the five published studies examining passive smoking and breast cancer have all suggested associations with both passive and active smoking, particularly premenopausal risk.
METHODS: We analyzed data collected through the Canadian National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System, from 805 premenopausal and 1512 postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed (incident), histologically confirmed, primary breast cancer and 2438 population controls. The mailed questionnaire included questions on breast cancer risk factors and a lifetime residential and occupational history of exposure to passive smoking.
RESULTS: Among premenopausal women who were never active smokers, regular exposure to passive smoke was associated with an adjusted breast cancer odds ratio (OR) of 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.6). Passive exposure showed a strong dose-response trend (test for trend p = 0.0007) with an OR of 2.9 (95% CI 1.3-6.6) for more than 35 years of passive residential and/or occupational exposure. When premenopausal women who had ever actively smoked were compared with women never regularly exposed to passive or active smoke, the adjusted OR for breast cancer was also 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.5). Among postmenopausal women who were never-active smokers, regular exposure to passive smoke was associated with an adjusted breast cancer OR of 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.8) and an OR of 1.4 (95% CI 0.9-2.3) for the most highly exposed quartile of women. The adjusted OR for postmenopausal breast cancer risk for ever-active smokers compared with women never regularly exposed to passive or active smoke was 1.5 (95% CI 1.0-2.3). Statistically significant dose-response relationships were observed with increasing years of smoking, increasing pack-years and decreasing years since quitting. Women with 35 or more years of smoking had an adjusted OR of 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.7).

,"10756694","[Nutrition and cancer].","Eichholzer M","The complex process of carcinogenesis is mainly due to environmental factors and therefore preventable. Diet may account for about 35% of cancer. This review presents the nutritional evidence for the development of the four most common cancers in Switzerland. The clearest risk factors for breast cancer are those associated with hormonal and reproductive factors. In relation to dietary factors, high alcohol intake, weight gain and adipositas (postmenopausal breast cancer) probably increase the risk of breast cancer. The evidence is less clear for the consumption of (animal) fat, meat, fruit and vegetables (inverse association). Hormones may also play an important role in the development of prostate cancer. There is no convincing evidence that any dietary factors modify the risk of prostate cancer. Diets high in vegetables are possibly protective, regular consumption of fat and meat possibly increase the risk. Intervention trials revealed protective effects of supplementation with selen or alpha-tocopherol. The main cause of lung cancer is cigarette smoking, and smokers whose diet is protective nevertheless remain at high risk. The evidence that diets high in vegetables and fruit protect against lung cancer is convincing, but it is not clear what constitutents are responsible for this effect. Intervention trials revealed no protective effect of beta-carotene, and in high risk groups, lung cancer risk was even increased. There is convincing evidence that diets high in vegetables decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. The same is true for regular physical activity. Alcohol and consumption of diets high in (red) meat, probably increase the risk of colorectal cancer. For cancer prevention it is recommended to choose a predominantly plant-based diet, to avoid obesity, to reduce the intake of fat, (red) meat, alcohol and salt, not to smoke and to be physically active.

,"10691062","Measuring the projected public health impact of lung cancer through lifetime and age-conditional risk estimates.","Merrill RM","PURPOSE: Lifetime and age-conditional probability (risk) estimates of developing lung cancer in the United States are presented by age, race, and gender. Effects on the risk estimates of an aging population and changing tobacco use are identified.
METHODS: Risk estimates were derived by applying cross-sectional, population-based incidence rates of malignant lung cancer and mortality rates from other causes to a hypothetical cohort. The cohort was aged through a double-decrement life table to determine the expected proportion of the population that would develop the disease across age intervals. Incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the National Centers for Health Statistics, respectively.
RESULTS: Among all cancers, risk estimates of developing lung cancer within 10 years, conditioned on being free of the disease at age 50, 60, or 70, ranked second to prostate cancer for men and second to breast cancer for women. For men, despite higher incidence rates of lung cancer for blacks than whites across most age groups, the risk of developing this disease over the life-span becomes similar, because white men are more likely to live to older ages where lung cancer is common. For women, lung cancer incidence rates are similar between Whites and Blacks, but an older age distribution among white women explains their greater lifetime risk of being diagnosed with the disease. Changes in the age distribution between the mid 1970s and the mid 1990s had little impact on the short-term risk estimates of developing lung cancer for younger ages but had a large influence on long-term risk estimates, particularly for the older age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Declining lung cancer among younger age groups may be attributed to declining tobacco use among the cohorts, but several more years may be required before the trends begin to fall in older age groups, particularly in women. In the meantime, an aging population is contributing to more people being diagnosed with lung cancer. Consequently, the projected risk of developing lung cancer will remain high for several years to come.","2000",,"Ann Epidemiol"," PURPOSE : Lifetime and age-conditional probability ( risk ) estimates of developing lung cancer in the United States are presented by age , race , and gender ","other","Adult, FALSE, Age Distribution, FALSE, Age of Onset, TRUE, Aged, FALSE, Cohort Studies, FALSE, Cross-Sectional Studies, FALSE, Female, FALSE, Humans, FALSE, Incidence, FALSE, Life Tables, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, epidemiology, Q000453, Male, FALSE, Middle Aged, FALSE, Probability, FALSE, Racial Groups, FALSE, Risk Assessment, FALSE, Sex Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
,"10667460","Genetic polymorphism of CYP genes, alone or in combination, as a risk modifier of tobacco-related cancers.","Bartsch H","Tobacco use is causally associated with cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, esophagus, kidneys, urinary tract, and possibly, breast. Major classes of carcinogens present in tobacco and tobacco smoke are converted into DNA-reactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 (CYP)-related enzymes, several of which display genetic polymorphism. Individual susceptibility to cancer is likely to be modified by the genotype for enzymes involved in the activation or detoxification of carcinogens in tobacco and repair of DNA damage. We summarize here the results of case-control studies published since 1990 on the effects of genetic variants of CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2D6, 2E1, 2C9, 2C19, 17, and 19 alone or in combination with detoxifying enzymes as modifiers of the risk for tobacco-related cancers. The results of studies on gene-gene interactions and the dependence of smoking-related DNA adducts on genotype were also analyzed. Some CYP variants were associated with increased risks for cancers of the lung, esophagus, and head and neck. The risk was often increased in individuals who also had GSTM1 deficiency. For breast cancer in women, a few studies suggested an association with CYPs related to metabolism of tobacco carcinogens and steroidal hormones. The overall effects of common CYP polymorphisms were found to be moderate in terms of penetrance and relative risk, with odds ratios ranging from 2 to 10. Some CYP1A1/GSTM1 0/0 genotype combinations seem to predispose the lung, esophagus, and oral cavity of smokers to an even higher risk for cancer or DNA damage, requiring, however, confirmation. Future strategies in molecular cancer epidemiology for identifying such susceptible individuals are discussed with emphasis on well-designed larger studies.","2000",,"Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev",," review","Breast Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Carcinogens, FALSE, metabolism, Q000378, Case-Control Studies, FALSE, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, FALSE, classification, Q000145, DNA Adducts, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, DNA Damage, FALSE, DNA Repair, FALSE, Esophageal Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Female, FALSE, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, FALSE, Genotype, FALSE, Glutathione Transferase, FALSE, deficiency, Q000172, Head and Neck Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Humans, FALSE, Lung Neoplasms, FALSE, etiology, Q000209, Neoplasms, FALSE, enzymology, Q000201, Phenotype, FALSE, Polymorphism, Genetic, FALSE, genetics, Q000235, Risk Factors, FALSE, Smoking, FALSE, adverse effects, Q000009",,,1,"projTutoBreastCan","2024-02-02"
