Vascular calcification (VC) has been established as a critical risk factor for accelerated CVD. In CKD, phosphorus (Pi), iron (Fe) and Nrf2 are modulators of VC and important agonists and antagonists of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether Fe administration, which is commonly used to treat renal anemia, affects aortic Fe overload and VC, and whether Nrf2 and its related genes, ferritin H and HIF-1α, are involved in the development of VC.
METHODS: A CKD model was created in rats by administering adenine and simultaneously feeding a high-Pi diet. In addition to control and CKD rats without Fe administration (No-Fe group), Fe was administered orally (PO-Fe group) or intraperitoneally (IP-Fe group) to CKD animals to clarify the effects of Fe administration on the aortic Fe and calcium (Ca) contents and the involvement of Nrf2 and its induced antioxidative proteins, ferritin H and HIF-1α, in VC.
RESULTS: The aortic Fe content increased significantly in the IP-Fe group, which was closely correlated with liver HAMP (hepcidin) expression in all animals. Fe administration had no significant effect on the aortic Ca and Pi contents regardless of the route of Fe administration. The aortic mRNA level of Nrf2 was significantly increased in the IP-Fe group and correlated with serum Pi levels and aortic Fe contents, which could respond to oxidative stress. Notably, the mRNA level of Nrf2 was also significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of ferritin H and HIF-1α. Since we could not measure Nrf2 protein levels in this study, we confirmed the upregulation of HMOX1 and NQO1 mRNA expression in parallel with Nrf2 mRNA.
CONCLUSION: Parenteral Fe administration increased aortic Fe in parallel with the liver HAMP mRNA level but did not affect VC. Aortic Nrf2 mRNA levels correlated significantly with aortic Fe and serum Pi levels and with aortic mRNA levels of ferritin H and HIF-1α as well as HMOX1 and NQO1.","2023",,"BMC Nephrol"," The aim of this study was to determine whether Fe administration , which is commonly used to treat renal anemia , affects aortic Fe overload and VC , and whether Nrf2 and its related genes , ferritin H and HIF-1α , are involved in the development of VC ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"38098876","Iron Supplements Concomitant within Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain Inhibitors in the Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease Anemia.","Wang X","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common and important complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Accordingly, the current treatment is based on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) have been developed to treat renal anemia through a novel mechanism. HIF-PHIs increase erythropoietin at physiologic blood concentrations and also improve the supply of hematopoietic iron. Iron is the main component of hemoglobin, and ensuring efficient iron metabolism is essential in the treatment of anemia.
SUMMARY: HIF-PHIs may have advantages in improving iron utilization and mobilization compared to ESAs. Most HIF-PHI trials revealed a significant decline of hepcidin, increase in transferrin level and total iron binding capacity in patients. From a clinical point of view, improvements in iron metabolism should translate into reductions in iron supplementation. There are differences in the iron treatment regimentation currently used, so it is important to evaluate and timely iron supplementation across studies.
KEY MESSAGES: This review summarizes the mechanism of HIF-PHIs on improved iron metabolism and the route of iron usage in the trials for dialysis-dependent CKD and non-dialysis CKD. And this review also makes an interpretation of the clinical practice guidelines in China and recommendation by Asia Pacific Society of Nephrology.","2023",,"Kidney Dis (Basel)",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

,"37994409","Renal specific loss of Ferroportin disrupts iron homeostasis and attenuates recovery from acute kidney injury.","Soofi A","Chronic kidney disease is increasing at an alarming rate and correlates with the increase in diabetes, obesity, and hypertension that disproportionately impacts socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Iron plays essential roles in many biological processes including oxygen transport, mitochondrial function, cell proliferation, and regeneration. However, excess iron induces the generation and propagation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to oxidative stress, cellular damage, and ferroptosis. Iron homeostasis is regulated in part by the kidney through iron resorption from the glomerular filtrate and export into the plasma by ferroportin (FPN). Yet the impact of iron overload in the kidney has not been addressed. To test more directly whether excess iron accumulation is toxic to kidneys, we generated a kidney proximal tubule specific knockout of FPN. Despite significant intracellular iron accumulation in FPN mutant tubules, basal kidney function was not measurably different from wild type kidneys. However, upon induction of acute kidney injury (AKI), FPN mutant kidneys exhibited significantly more damage and failed recovery, evidence for ferroptosis, and increased fibrosis. Thus, disruption of iron export in proximal tubules, leading to iron overload, can significantly impair recovery from AKI and can contribute to progressive renal damage indicative of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Understanding the mechanisms that regulation iron homeostasis in the kidney may provide new therapeutic strategies for progressive kidney disease and other ferroptosis-associated disorders.","2023",,"Am J Physiol Renal Physiol",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

More data are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of roxadustat in regulating iron metabolism in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs).
METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled PD patients with a mean hemoglobin level of 60-100 g/L. All subjects were randomized into two groups at a ratio of 2:1 the roxadustat group (106 cases), and the ESA group (53 cases). The primary endpoint was the change in the iron biomarker levels and the proportion of patients with absolute iron deficiency and functional iron deficiency.
RESULTS: Compared with ESAs, roxadustat significantly decreased hepcidin level (difference, - 20.09 ng/mL; 95% CI, - 30.26 to - 9.92), attenuated the increase in serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTFR) level (difference, - 7.87 nmol/L; 95% CI, - 12.11 to - 3.64), and reduced the proportion of patients with functional iron deficiency (roxadustat, 11.43%; ESA, 33.33%). There was no significant difference in safety of the two groups over the duration of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ESA group, roxadustat group showed significant differences in all iron biomarker levels except serum ferritin (sFt) and transferrin saturation (TSAT). These results suggest that roxadustat was superior to ESAs as a therapy for iron metabolism in PD patients.

,"37701608","FGF23 AND ALTERED MINERAL HOMEOSTASIS IN KIDNEY DISEASE AND FOLLOWING INTRAVENOUS IRON.","Wolf M","Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an endocrine hormone that stimulates renal phosphate excretion and suppresses circulating concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). These effects of FGF23 are most evident in rare diseases that are characterized by FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemic rickets-osteomalacia. More commonly, elevated FGF23 is a ubiquitous, early consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in which it helps to maintain normal serum phosphate levels but causes secondary hyperparathyroidism by suppressing 1,25D, and directly promotes cardiovascular disease and death. Elevated FGF23 is also a common complication of intravenous administration of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), which is widely used to treat iron deficiency anemia. Among patients with normal kidney function who receive FCM, the resulting increase in FGF23 and subsequent FGF23-mediated reduction of 1,25D and secondary hyperparathyroidism promote hypophosphatemia that can be symptomatic, severe, and associated with musculoskeletal complications. Ongoing research is needed to design novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate FGF23-related illnesses.","2023",,"Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

This narrative review describes the effects of roxadustat on iron parameters and on hemoglobin levels in the context of iron supplementation in patients with anemia of non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) or dialysis-dependent (DD) chronic kidney disease (CKD). Roxadustat use was associated with a greater reduction in serum ferritin levels than seen with ESAs and an increase in serum iron levels compared to a decrease with ESAs. Decreases in transferrin saturation in patients treated with roxadustat were relatively small and, in the case of patients with NDD CKD, not observed by Week 52. These changes reflect the concomitant increases in both serum iron and total iron-binding capacity. Compared to placebo and an ESA, roxadustat improved iron availability and increased erythropoiesis while requiring less intravenous iron use. Hepcidin levels generally decreased in patients who received roxadustat compared to baseline values in all CKD populations; these decreases appear to be more robust with roxadustat than with an ESA or placebo. The mechanisms behind the effects of roxadustat and ESAs on iron availability and stores and erythropoiesis appear to differ and should be considered holistically when treating anemia of CKD.","2023",,"J Clin Med",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Patients with serum transferrin saturation <20% demonstrated an increased risk of CVD [subdistribution hazard ratio (HR) 2.13] and congestive heart failure (subdistribution HR 2.42). The magnitude of reduction in CVD risk with iron supplementation was greater in patients with lower transferrin saturations (P = .042).

,"37151072","An Analytical Method for Determination of Total Iron in Pharmaceuticalgrade Intravenous Iron Colloidal Complexes by Redox-Potentiometry.","Kamisetty MK","BACKGROUND: Iron carbohydrate complexes are colloidal dispersions made up of polynuclear Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide cores surrounded by a carbohydrate shell that stabilizes the complex in iron colloidal formulations. The current study provides an improved method that is precise, accurate, and linear for quantifying total iron in most Iron Carbohydrate Colloid Drug Products.
METHODS: Redox iodometry with a potentiometric determination is used to evaluate total iron in intravenous formulations. The visual indicator approach is more prone to fluctuations at endpoint calculations. Hence, the voltage potential approach is widely accepted as it is more accurate and sensitive. It tracks the actual change in activity that coincides with the equivalence point that is finally considered an endpoint. The principle is based on the idea that ferric iron in formulation reduces to ferrous iron in the presence of the iodide, which oxidizes to iodine. The released iodine is titrated using sodium thiosulfate.
RESULTS: The proposed method was precise, with %RSD (relative standard deviation) not more than 1. The method was linear between 80% and 120%, with a linear regression of 0.999. The percent recovery ranged from 98.20 to 99.98 for the concentration ranges of 80-120. The method's robustness was checked by various analysts using different reagent grades.
CONCLUSION: The proposed potentiometric determination method was precise, accurate, linear, and sensitive. The method was successfully validated, and the total iron content determined for commercial batches agrees with the iron claim on the label. Therefore, this method can be adapted widely for total iron content determination in any Intravenous formulation currently available on the market. The proposed method is more accessible at the Quality Control facilities on an industrial scale.","2023",,"Pharm Nanotechnol",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Nonetheless, it is unclear how JPYS influences renal anemia and iron metabolism.
AIM OF THE STUDY: An analysis of network pharmacology, chemical profiling, and in vivo experiments was conducted to identify the impact of JPYS on JAK2-STAT3 pathway and iron utilization in renal anemia and CKD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical properties of JPYS and its exposed ingredients were detected in vivo. And based on the aforesaid chemical compounds, the potential targets and signaling pathways of JPYS for renal anemia treatment were predicted by network pharmacology. Afterward, an adenine-feeding animal model of CKD-related anemia was developed to verify the mechanism by which JPYS modulates iron recycling to treat renal anemia. Renal injury was estimated by serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), histopathological examinations and fibrosis degree. Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry approaches were utilized to assess the levels of JAK2, STAT3 and iron metabolism-related factors.
RESULTS: There were 164 active ingredients identified in JPYS, including prototypes and metabolites in vivo were identified in JPYS, and 21 core targets were found through network pharmacology based on topological characteristics. Combined with the core targets and pathway enrichment analysis, the majority of the candidate targets were associated with the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathways. Experimental results indicated that JPYS treatment significantly decreased the expression of BUN and Scr, restored renal pathological damage, down-regulated fibrosis degree, and improved hematological parameters such as red blood cell, hemoglobin and hematocrit in CKD rats. Furthermore, JPYS significantly restored iron metabolism from dysregulation by increasing the levels of iron and ferritin in the serum, inhibiting the production of hepcidin in liver and serum, and regulating transferrin receptor 1 in bone marrow. Meanwhile, the expression of JAK2 and STAT3 was suppressed by JPYS treatment.

METHOD: Five electronic databases were searched for studies. Randomized controlled clinical trials comparing HIF-PHIs, ESAs, and placebo in NDD-CKD patients were selected. The statistical program used for network meta-analysis was Stata/SE 15.1. The main outcomes were the change in hepcidin and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. The merits of intervention measures were predicted by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve method.
RESULTS: Of 1,589 original titles screened, data were extracted from 15 trials (3,228 participants). All HIF-PHIs and ESAs showed greater Hb level-raising ability than placebo. Among them, desidustat demonstrated the highest probability of increasing Hb (95.6%). Hepcidin [mean deviation (MD) = -43.42, 95%CI: -47.08 to -39.76], ferritin (MD= -48.56, 95%CI: -55.21 to -41.96), and transferrin saturation (MD = -4.73, 95%CI: -5.52 to -3.94) were decreased, while transferrin (MD = 0.09, 95%CI: 0.01 to 0.18) and total iron-binding capacity (MD = 6.34, 95%CI: 5.71 to 6.96) was increased in HIF-PHIs versus those in ESAs. In addition, this study observed heterogeneity in the ability of HIF-PHIs to decrease hepcidin. Compared with darbepoetin, only daprodustat (MD = -49.09, 95% CI: -98.13 to -0.05) could significantly reduce hepcidin levels. Meanwhile, daprodustat also showed the highest hepcidin-lowering efficacy (84.0%), while placebo was the lowest (8.2%).
CONCLUSION: For NDD-CKD patients, HIF-PHIs could ameliorate functional iron deficiency by promoting iron transport and utilization, which may be achieved by decreasing hepcidin levels. Interestingly, HIF-PHIs had heterogeneous effects on iron metabolism.

,"36990212","A single approach to targeting transferrin receptor 2 corrects iron and erythropoietic defects in murine models of anemia of inflammation and chronic kidney disease.","Olivari V","Anemia is a common complication of systemic inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines both decrease erythroblast sensitivity to erythropoietin (EPO) and increase the levels of the hepatic hormone hepcidin, sequestering iron in stores and causing functional iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a peculiar form of anemia of inflammation, characterized by impaired EPO production paralleling progressive kidney damage. Traditional therapy based on increased EPO (often in combination with iron) may have off-target effects due to EPO interaction with its non-erythroid receptors. Transferrin Receptor 2 (Tfr2) is a mediator of the iron-erythropoiesis crosstalk. Its deletion in the liver hampers hepcidin production, increasing iron absorption, whereas its deletion in the hematopoietic compartment increases erythroid EPO sensitivity and red blood cell production. Here, we show that selective hematopoietic Tfr2 deletion ameliorates anemia in mice with sterile inflammation in the presence of normal kidney function, promoting EPO responsiveness and erythropoiesis without increasing serum EPO levels. In mice with CKD, characterized by absolute rather than functional iron deficiency, Tfr2 hematopoietic deletion had a similar effect on erythropoiesis but anemia improvement was transient because of limited iron availability. Also, increasing iron levels by downregulating only hepatic Tfr2 had a minor effect on anemia. However, simultaneous deletion of hematopoietic and hepatic Tfr2, stimulating erythropoiesis and increased iron supply, was sufficient to ameliorate anemia for the entire protocol. Thus, our results suggest that combined targeting of hematopoietic and hepatic Tfr2 may be a therapeutic option to balance erythropoiesis stimulation and iron increase, without affecting EPO levels.","2023",,"Kidney Int",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Thus, we investigated the association of iron or iron saturation with renal outcomes in a CKD cohort. During a follow-up of 8.2 years, 781 (31.2%) patients met the composite renal outcome of renal replacement therapy and a 50% decline in renal function. In linear regression, iron was associated with sex, hemoglobin (Hb), and nutritional markers. In a fully adjusted Cox regression model, the male patients with normal iron had a significantly decreased risk of renal outcomes (hazard ratio (HR) 0.718; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.579 to 0.889), but the female patients did not exhibit this association. The non-anemic patients (Hb ≥ 11 g/dL) had a decreased risk of renal outcomes (HR 0.715; 95% CI 0.568 to 0.898), but the anemic patients did not. In the sensitivity analysis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) showed similar results. When comparing iron and TSAT, both indicators showed similar prognostic values.

These toxic metals have several harmful effects on the body, including the kidney, which is a very sensitive organ. Indeed, heavy metal exposure has been linked to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression, which may be explained by the well-established nephrotoxic effects of these metals. In this hypothesis and narrative literature review, we will shed light on the potential role that another highly common problem in patients with CKD, iron deficiency, may play in the damaging effects of heavy metal exposure in this patient group. Iron deficiency has previously been linked with an increased uptake of heavy metals in the intestine due to the upregulation of iron receptors that also take up other metals. Furthermore, recent research suggests a role of iron deficiency in the retention of heavy metals in the kidney. Therefore, we hypothesize that iron deficiency plays a crucial role in the damaging effects of heavy metal exposure in patients with CKD and that iron supplementation might be a strategy to combat these detrimental processes.","2023",,"Int J Mol Sci",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

METHODS: We conducted retrospective analysis of the changes in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels; transferrin saturation; the estimated glomerular filtration rate; and the urinary protein/creatinine ratio over 24 weeks after the change from an ESA to roxadustat in 50 patients with non-dialysis CKD and anemia (roxadustat group). Seventy-two patients with non-dialysis CKD and anemia who proceeded ESA therapy were used as the control (ESA) group.
RESULTS: We observed no significant between-group differences in clinical parameters at baseline except for the significantly lower hemoglobin concentration and lower proportion of diabetes mellitus in the roxadustat group. The hemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in the roxadustat group after 24 weeks (11.3 ± 1.2 versus 10.3 ± 1.0 g/dL;

The hematocrit (HCT), blood chemistries, plasma iron, plasma TF, UPC ratio, urinary iron per creatinine ratio (U-Iron/CR), and urinary TF per creatinine ratio (U-TF/CR) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Anemia was associated with the severity of renal impairment as demonstrated by reduction of HCT when staging of CKD was higher.

It is often observed in patients with chronic diseases, such as heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. ID is associated with poor clinical outcome, including poor performance, reduced quality of life, as well as increased hospitalization and mortality. The aim of this review is to provide an overview about the role of ID in chronic diseases (HF, CKD, IBD, cancer) regarding their current definitions and clinical relevance; diagnostic accuracy of iron parameters in chronic inflammatory conditions and its potential as prognostic markers. Due to different definitions and guideline recommendations of ID, various laboratory parameters for ID diagnostic exist and there is no general consensus about the definition of ID and its treatment. Still, a general trend can be observed across all investigated indications of this review (HF, CKD, IBD, cancer) that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are the two parameters mentioned most often and emphasized in all guidelines to define ID and guide treatment. The most commonly used threshold values for the diagnosis of ID are TSAT of < 20% and serum ferritin of < 100-300 µg/L. Noteworthy, both TSAT and particularly ferritin are frequently applied, but both may vary due to inflammatory conditions. Studies showed that TSAT is less affected by inflammatory processes and may therefore be more accurate and reliable than serum ferritin, particularly in conditions with elevated inflammatory state. A low iron status and particularly a low TSAT value was associated with a poor outcome in all investigated indications, with the strongest evidence in HF patients. Routine surveillance of iron status in these groups of patients with chronic conditions is advisable to detect ID early. Depending on the inflammatory state, TSAT < 20% may be the more accurate diagnostic marker of ID than ferritin. Moreover, TSAT may also be the more reliable estimate for the prognosis, particularly in HF.","2023",,"Eur J Med Res"," The aim of this review is to provide an overview about the role of ID in chronic diseases ( HF , CKD , IBD , cancer ) regarding their current definitions and clinical relevance ; diagnostic accuracy of iron parameters in chronic inflammatory conditions and its potential as prognostic markers "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

It is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease. During chronic kidney disease, iron deficiency is defined by a transferrin saturation <20% and/or a serum ferritin <100 μg/L. In France, about half of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients have absolute iron deficiency (transferrin saturation <20% and serum ferritin <100 μg/L) and/or functional iron deficiency (transferrin saturation <20% and serum ferritin >100 μg/L). Despite this, iron deficiency is usually not investigated. In fact, more than 60% of nephrologists do not assess iron status at least once a year. In addition, iron deficiency is rarely treated: only 12% of patients are prescribed oral or intravenous iron. Early detection and treatment are fundamental and should be systematic. In order to help improve the management of iron deficiency among non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients, we propose an algorithm that takes into account current recommendations and the most recent data from the literature. Initial blood test requires the measurement of hemoglobin concentration, transferrin saturation and serum ferritin. A transferrin saturation <20% establishes the diagnosis of iron deficiency and the serum ferritin level points towards an absolute or functional deficiency. The combination of both values makes it possible to adapt the treatment, particularly in an inflammatory context where oral iron is not effective.","2022",,"Nephrol Ther",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

However, little is known about local kidney iron homeostasis and its role in kidney fibrosis. Kidney-specific effects of iron therapy in CKD also remain elusive. Here, we elucidate the role of macrophage iron status in kidney fibrosis and demonstrate that it is a potential therapeutic target. In CKD, kidney macrophages exhibited depletion of labile iron pool (LIP) and induction of transferrin receptor 1, indicating intracellular iron deficiency. Low LIP in kidney macrophages was associated with their defective antioxidant response and proinflammatory polarization. Repletion of LIP in kidney macrophages through knockout of ferritin heavy chain (Fth1) reduced oxidative stress and mitigated fibrosis. Similar to Fth1 knockout, iron dextran therapy, through replenishing macrophage LIP, reduced oxidative stress, decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and alleviated kidney fibrosis. Interestingly, iron markedly decreased TGF-β expression and suppressed TGF-β-driven fibrotic response of macrophages. Iron dextran therapy and FtH suppression had an additive protective effect against fibrosis. Adoptive transfer of iron-loaded macrophages alleviated kidney fibrosis, validating the protective effect of iron-replete macrophages in CKD. Thus, targeting intracellular iron deficiency of kidney macrophages in CKD can serve as a therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease progression.","2023",,"JCI Insight"," However , little is known about local kidney iron homeostasis and its role in kidney fibrosis ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

There is growing interest about the role of iron supplementation in CKD, particularly ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), also in relation to the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Despite a greater knowledge on ID management in patients receiving haemodialysis, a paucity of data exists about peritoneal dialysis (PD). Furthermore, the aim of this paper is to provide the results of a nationwide Italian survey about ID in PD using the Delphi method.
METHODS: A list of 16 statements (48 items) was developed about four main topics: (1) approach to iron therapy in PD; (2) management experience about iron therapy in PD; (3) ESA and iron in PD; (4) pharmacoeconomic impact. Using the Delphi methodology, the survey was distributed online to 36 Italian nephrologists with expertise in PD, who rated their level of agreement with each item on a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was predefined as more than 66% of the panel agreeing/disagreeing with any given statement.
RESULTS: Twenty-five experts (70%) answered the survey. 35 items (73%) achieved a consensus (8 negative and 27 positive). In particular, the diagnosis of ID is widely known, but some doubts exist about how frequently test it. The use of I.V. iron seems to be routinary and can save money reducing the administration of ESAs. However, internal protocols are welcome.

In this exploratory analysis, we assessed the effect of roxadustat treatment on laboratory parameters related to iron metabolism in patients with anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: Data were pooled from pivotal, randomized, phase 3 roxadustat trials: three placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in nondialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD and three open-label, active-comparator (epoetin alfa) trials in dialysis-dependent (DD) CKD. In this exploratory analysis, mean changes from baseline in hemoglobin, iron parameters, and hepcidin, and intravenous (iv) iron use were evaluated. Pooled results in NDD CKD and DD CKD patients are reported.
RESULTS: Overall, 4277 patients with NDD CKD and 3890 patients with DD CKD were evaluated. Hemoglobin increases with roxadustat treatment were accompanied by increases in serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin from baseline through week 52. With epoetin alfa, the hemoglobin increase was accompanied by decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin, but serum iron decreased, and there was no change in TIBC. With placebo, there were no changes in hemoglobin, iron parameters, or hepcidin. During treatment, iv iron use was reduced with roxadustat versus placebo and epoetin alfa.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NDD CKD and DD CKD, roxadustat treatment is associated with increases in serum iron and TIBC, accompanied by reduced hepcidin and indicative of improved iron kinetics. Patients treated with roxadustat achieved target hemoglobin levels with less iv iron use versus comparators.

A retrospective observational real-world analysis was performed on administrative databases of healthcare entities, covering around 6.9 million health-assisted individuals. From January 2010 to March 2019, ND-CKD patients were included and diagnosed with IDA in the presence of two low-haemoglobin (Hb) measurements. Patients were divided into IDA-treated and untreated, based on the prescription of iron [Anatomical-Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code B03A] or anti-anaemia preparations (ATC code B03X), and evaluated during a 6-month follow-up from the index date [first low haemoglobin (Hb) detection].

METHODS: We undertook an interventional study to investigate the effects of oral versus intravenous iron therapy on the gut microbiota. Oral ferrous succinate tablets (n = 14) or intravenous iron sucrose (n = 14) was administered to anemic maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients for 2 months.
RESULTS: Oral and intravenous iron treatments had different effects on gut microbial composition and diversity. After oral iron treatment, the α-diversity was decreased, while at the phylum level, the abundance of Firmicutes was reduced and the abundance of Bacteroides was increased. At the genus level, the abundance of Blautia and Coprococcus was decreased, and the abundance of Bacteroidetes was increased. Oral iron therapy was associated with a higher abundance of Lactobacillus compared with that measured in intravenous iron-treated patients. According to metagenome function prediction analysis, oral iron increased the metabolic processes of phenylalanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. These changes may increase uremic toxin levels, thereby increasing the progression of renal disease.

Notably, interventions to mitigate CKD myopathy are scarce.
METHODS: The effect of CKD in the absence and presence of iron supplementation on the contractile function of individual skeletal muscle fibers from the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles was evaluated in 16-week-old mice. CKD was induced by the adenine diet, and iron supplementation was by weekly iron dextran injections.
RESULTS: Maximally activated and fatigued fiber force production was decreased 24%-52% in untreated CKD, independent of size, by reducing strongly bound myosin/actin cross-bridges and/or decreasing myofilament stiffness in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I, IIA, and IIB fibers. Additionally, myosin/actin interactions in untreated CKD were slower for MHC I and IIA fibers and unchanged or faster in MHC IIB fibers. Iron supplementation improved anemia and did not change overall muscle mass in CKD mice. Iron supplementation ameliorated CKD-induced myopathy by increasing strongly bound cross-bridges, leading to improved specific tension, and/or returning the rate of myosin/actin interactions toward or equivalent to control values in MHC IIA and IIB fibers.
CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle force production was significantly reduced in untreated CKD, independent of fiber size, indicating that compromised physical function in patients is not solely due to muscle mass loss. Iron supplementation improved multiple aspects of CKD-induced myopathy, suggesting that timely correction of iron imbalance may aid in ameliorating contractile deficits in CKD patients.","2022",,"Kidney360",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Recent studies have elucidated that abnormal serum steroid levels might cause the elevation of hepcidin. Glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDCA), a steroid, is significantly elevated in patients with CKD. However, the correlation between GCDCA and hepcidin has not been elucidated. Decreased serum iron levels and increased hepcidin levels were both detected in patients with CKD in this study. Additionally, the concentrations of GCDCA in nephropathy patients were found to be higher than those in healthy subjects. HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of GCDCA on hepcidin in vitro. The results showed that hepcidin expression increased by nearly two-fold against control under 200 μM GCDCA treatment. The phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 increased remarkably, while STAT3 and CREBH remained unchanged. GCDCA triggered the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), followed with the transcription and expression of both BMP6 and ALK3 (upward regulators of SMAD1/5/8). Thus, GCDCA is a potential regulator for hepcidin, which possibly acts by triggering FXR and the BMP6/ALK3-SMAD signaling pathway. Furthermore, 40 C57/BL6 mice were treated with 100 mg/kg/d, 200 mg/kg/d, and 300 mg/kg/d GCDCA to investigate its effect on hepcidin in vivo. The serum level of hepcidin increased in mice treated with 200 mg/kg/d and 300 mg/kg/d GCDCA, while hemoglobin and serum iron levels decreased. Similarly, the FXR-mediated SMAD signaling pathway was also responsible for activating hepcidin in liver. Overall, it was concluded that GCDCA could induce the expression of hepcidin and reduce serum iron level, in which FXR activation-related SMAD signaling was the main target for GCDCA. Thus, abnormal GCDCA level indicates a potential risk of iron homeostasis imbalance.","2022",,"Nutrients"," HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of GCDCA on hepcidin in vitro ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The Iron and Muscle study aims to evaluate whether iron supplementation reduces symptoms of fatigue, improves muscle metabolism, and leads to enhanced exercise capacity and physical function. We report here the trial design and baseline characteristics.
METHODS: This is a prospective, double-blind multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) including 75 non-dialysis stage 3-4 CKD patients with iron deficiency but without anaemia. Patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to either: i) intravenous iron therapy, or ii) placebo, with concurrent recruitment of eight CKD non-iron deficient participants and six healthy volunteers. The primary outcome of the study is the six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance between baseline and four-weeks. An additional exercise training programme for patients in both groups was initiated and completed between 4 and 12 weeks, to determine the effect of iron repletion compared to placebo treatment in the context of patients undertaking an exercise programme. Additional secondary outcomes include fatigue, physical function, muscle strength, muscle metabolism, quality of life, resting blood pressure, clinical chemistry, safety and harms associated with the iron therapy intervention and the exercise training intervention, and hospitalisations. All outcomes were conducted at baseline, 4, and 12 weeks, with a nested qualitative study, to investigate the experience of living with iron deficiency and intervention acceptability.

The link between these two factors has been described at length in the literature highlighting an association of malnutrition with iron deficiency considered itself as one of the causes of anemia in chronic kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis). Our study aims to know the prevalence of these two factors in a population of chronic kidney disease (non-dialysis and hemodialysis) of Algiers and to highlight the possible associations between them.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a multicentre, cross-sectional and descriptive study carried out over a period of 6months (August 2018 to January 2019). Anemia and malnutrition were assessed by various biological and clinical tools such as the malnutrition inflammation score and the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism criteria. Statistical tests were performed on the R studio software, considering P<0.05 as a statistically significant value.
RESULTS: Two hundred and nine patients on chronic kidney disease were included (90 non dialysis and 119 hemodialysis). The median age was 70 (IQR=16) for non dialysis and 56 (IQR=16.5) for hemodialysis. The prevalence of anemia was 66.66% (n=60) in non dialysis and 70.58% (n=84) in hemodialysis. Absolute iron deficiency anemia was higher in non dialysis (48.33%; n=29) while functional iron deficiency anemia was higher in hemodialysis (34.52%; n=29). The prevalence of malnutrition by malnutrition inflammation score was relatively low. Only functional iron deficiency anemia was associated with malnutrition.

Limited studies have concurrently compared the effects of ferric citrate (FC) versus intravenous (IV) iron on CKD-MBD and iron homeostasis in moderate CKD.
METHODS: We tested the effects of 10 weeks of 2% FC versus IV iron sucrose in rats with moderate CKD (Cy/+ male rat) and untreated normal (NL) littermates. Outcomes included a comprehensive assessment of CKD-MBD, iron homeostasis and oxidative stress.
RESULTS: CKD rats had azotemia, elevated phosphorus, parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). Compared with untreated CKD rats, treatment with FC led to lower plasma phosphorus, intact FGF23 and a trend (P = 0.07) toward lower C-terminal FGF23. FC and IV iron equally reduced aorta and heart calcifications to levels similar to NL animals. Compared with NL animals, CKD animals had higher bone turnover, lower trabecular volume and no difference in mineralization; these were unaffected by either iron treatment. Rats treated with IV iron had cortical and bone mechanical properties similar to NL animals. FC increased the transferrin saturation rate compared with untreated CKD and NL rats. Neither iron treatment increased oxidative stress above that of untreated CKD.

Anemia is one of the common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a significant clinical problem. It is most often the result of decreased renal production of erythropoietin and / or iron deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common problems in CKD that increases mortality. In order to successfully treat anemia in CKD with erythropoiesis-stimulating agentsand (ESA) and iron substitution, it is necessary to determine iron iron level.

For more than 3 decades, however, nephrologists have focused primarily on the correction of anemia. The achievement of target hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations is prioritized over repletion of iron stores, and iron status is generally a secondary consideration only assessed in those patients with anemia. Historically, the correction of ID independent of anemia has not been a primary focus in the management of CKD. In contrast, ID is a key therapeutic target in the setting of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); correction of ID in this population improves functional status and quality of life and may improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Given the strong interrelationships between HF and CKD, it is reasonable to consider whether iron therapy alone may benefit those with CKD and evidence of ID irrespective of Hgb concentration. In this review, we differentiate anemia from ID by considering both epidemiologic and pathophysiological perspectives and by reviewing the evidence linking correction of ID to outcomes in patients with HF and/or CKD.

However, intravenous iron may pose limitations, such as potential infusion reactions. Oral iron is mainly composed of divalent iron, which can excessively stimulate the gastrointestinal tract. Iron polysaccharide complex capsules are a novel oral iron trivalent supplement with higher iron content and lower gastrointestinal irritation. However, since high-quality evidence-based medicinal support is lacking, it is necessary to conduct clinical studies to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral iron polysaccharide complex in chronic kidney disease patients.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial uses an open-label, parallel group design, where the efficacy and safety of maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) participants is evaluated. The experimental group is assigned erythropoietins and iron polysaccharide complex (two capsules each time, bid), and the control group is assigned erythropoietin and sucrose iron (100mg, 2w) injection. Participants (aged 18-75 years) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were considered for screening. Inclusion criteria included hemoglobin (Hb) ≥110g/L and < 130g/L, transferrin saturation (TSAT) > 20% and < 50%, and serum ferritin (SF) > 200μg/L and < 500μg/L. Exclusion criteria included acute or chronic bleeding, serum albumin < 35g/L, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (HsCRP) > 10 mg/L, and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (iPTH ≥ 800 pg/mL). Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the ""Methods"" section. The primary endpoint is TSAT of the participants at week 12. Secondary endpoints include Hb, SF, hematocrit (Hct), HsCRP, pharmacoeconomic evaluation, drug costs, quality of life, and indicators of oxidative stress. The treatment will last for 24 weeks with a follow-up visit at baseline (within 7 days prior to initial treatment) and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 after initial treatment. This clinical research includes 9 hemodialysis centers in mainland China and plans to enroll 186 participants.
DISCUSSION: It is expected that it will provide strong evidence to reveal the clinical efficacy and safety of oral iron in the treatment of chronic CKD-related anemia in MHD patients through this clinical trial.

We hypothesized that serum catalytic iron (SCI) is associated with progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: Baseline samples of the Indian Chronic Kidney Disease participants with at least one follow up visit were tested for total iron, iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, SCI, ferritin and hepcidin. SCI was measured using the bleomycin-detectable iron assay that detects biologically active iron. Association with the incidence of major kidney endpoints, (MAKE, a composite of kidney death, kidney failure or > 40% loss of eGFR) was examined using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for sex and age.
RESULTS: 2002 subjects (49.9 ± 11.6 years, 68.1% males, baseline eGFR 41.01 ml/min/1.73m2) were enrolled. After a median follow up of 12.6 (12.2, 16.7) months, the composite MAKE occurred in 280 (14%). After adjusting for age and sex, increase from 25th to 75th percentile in SCI, transferrin saturation, ferritin and hepcidin were associated with 78% (43-122%), 34% (10-62%), 57% (24-100%) and 74% (35-124%) increase in hazard of MAKE, respectively.

As a result of the side effects of high doses of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) and the differences in the standard dose of the injectable iron, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of high and low intravenous iron supplementation on hematinic parameters and EPO requirements in patients under hemodialysis.
METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients with CKD admitted to Sina and 29 Bahman hospitals in Tabriz, Iran in 2019-2020 to undergo hemodialysis. In the two studied groups, low (100 mg/week) and high (400 mg/week) doses of iron were administered and subjects were followed up for 6 months. The incidence of acute myocardial ischemia, stroke, and mortality during 6 months was recorded.
RESULTS: The required rhEPO dosage (mg/week) to maintain hemoglobin levels between 10 and 12 g/dL in the high-dose iron group was significantly decreased during the follow-up period (52,129.03 ± 23,810 vs. 45,760 ± 20,978.71, P ≤ 0.028).

Iron therapy in CKD has focused primarily on supporting erythropoiesis. In patients with or without anemia, there has not been a comprehensive approach to estimating the association between serum biomarkers of iron stores, and mortality and cardiovascular event risks.
METHODS: The study included 5145 patients from Brazil, France, the United States, and Germany enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, with first available transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin levels as exposure variables. We used Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with progressive adjustment for potentially confounding variables. We also used linear spline models to further evaluate functional forms of the exposure-outcome associations.
RESULTS: Compared with patients with a TSAT of 26%-35%, those with a TSAT ≤15% had the highest adjusted risks for all-cause mortality and MACE. Spline analysis found the lowest risk at TSAT 40% for all-cause mortality and MACE. Risk of all-cause mortality, but not MACE, was also elevated at TSAT ≥46%. Effect estimates were similar after adjustment for hemoglobin. For ferritin, no directional associations were apparent, except for elevated all-cause mortality at ferritin ≥300 ng/ml.
CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency, as captured by TSAT, is associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality and MACE in patients with nondialysis CKD, with or without anemia.

For decades, iron therapy has been the mainstay of therapy for renal anaemia together with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Despite its long-standing use, grey areas still surround the use of iron therapy in CKD. In particular, the right balance between either iron repletion with adequate therapy and the avoidance of iron overload and its possible negative effects is still a matter of debate. This is particularly true in patients having functional iron deficiency. The recent Proactive IV Iron Therapy in Haemodialysis Patients trial supports the use of intravenous (IV) iron therapy until a ferritin upper limit of 700 ng/mL is reached in haemodialysis patients on ESA therapy, with short dialysis vintage and minimal signs of inflammation. IV iron therapy has also been proven to be effective in the setting of heart failure (HF), where it improves exercise capacity and quality of life and possibly reduces the risk of HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular deaths.

STUDY DESIGN: Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (AEGIS-CKD) and open-label extension.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD and iron-deficiency anemia at 30 US centers.
INTERVENTION: Oral ferric maltol at 30mg or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks (2:1 randomization) followed by ferric maltol at 30mg twice daily for up to 36 weeks (all patients).
OUTCOME: Change from baseline in hemoglobin (primary end point at week 16), ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron; safety.
RESULTS: 167 patients were randomized (ferric maltol, n=111; placebo, n=56). At week 16, hemoglobin had increased significantly with ferric maltol versus placebo (least-squares mean difference: 0.5±0.2 [SE] g/dL; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P=0.01). Ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron increased with ferric maltol but declined with placebo (all P<0.05).

The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (randomized phase: 41% vs 30% [ferric maltol vs placebo]; open-label phase: 56% vs 46%, respectively). Adverse events led to treatment withdrawal in 7 patients (6%) receiving ferric maltol and 5 patients (9%) receiving placebo during double-blind treatment, and 11 patients (9%) during the open-label extension.

Iron dysmetabolism potentially contributes to heart failure, but this relationship has not been well characterized in CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We performed a historical cohort study using data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse to evaluate the relationship between iron status and heart failure hospitalization. We identified a CKD cohort with at least one set of iron indices between 2006 and 2015. The first available date of serum iron indices was identified as the study index date. The cohort was divided into four iron groups on the basis of the joint quartiles of serum transferrin saturation (shown in percent) and ferritin (shown in nanograms per milliliter): reference (16%-28%, 55-205 ng/ml), low iron (0.4%-16%, 0.9-55 ng/ml), high iron (28%-99.5%, 205-4941 ng/ml), and function iron deficiency (0.8%-16%, 109-2783 ng/ml). We compared 1-year heart failure hospitalization risk between the iron groups using matching weights derived from multinomial propensity score models and Poisson rate-based regression.
RESULTS: A total of 78,551 veterans met the eligibility criteria. The covariates were well balanced among the iron groups after applying the propensity score weights (

,"33777495","Iron metabolism and management: focus on chronic kidney disease.","Agarwal AK","Anemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and results from the dysregulation of iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron availability and leads to iron sequestration during the state of iron repletion. Decreases in the level of hepcidin in the presence of hypoxia and/or iron limitation allow for greater iron availability for erythropoiesis. However, kidney excretion of hepcidin decreases as the severity of CKD increases, whereas production of hepcidin is increased under inflammatory conditions often present in patients with CKD, both of which contribute to anemia. Assessment of iron status is, therefore, essential in the treatment of anemia. However, current laboratory tests for the determination of the adequate supply of iron have many limitations, including diurnal variation in the levels of biomarkers, lack of standardized reference methods across laboratories, and confounding by the presence of inflammation. In addition, the current treatment paradigm for anemia of CKD can further disrupt iron homeostasis; for example, treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the absence of supplemental iron can induce functional iron deficiency. Moreover, supplemental iron can further increase levels of hepcidin. Several novel therapies, including hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors and hepcidin inhibitors/antagonists, have shown promise in attenuating the levels and/or activity of hepcidin in anemia of CKD, thus ensuring the availability of iron for erythropoiesis.","2021",,"Kidney Int Suppl (2011)",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

This IRON-CKD trial compared the effects of different IV irons on oxidative stress and inflammation.
METHODS: In this randomized open-label explorative single-center study in the United Kingdom, non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with iron deficiency were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive a single infusion of 200 mg iron dextran, or 200 mg iron sucrose (IS), or 200 mg or 1,000 mg ferric derisomaltose (FDI) and were followed up for 3 months. The primary outcomes measured were induction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Secondarily, efficacy, vascular function, quality of life, and safety were monitored.
RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. No significant rise in oxidative stress existed, regardless of preparation or dose. There was a significant rise in LPI with 1,000 mg FDI at 2 hours that normalized within a week, not impacting oxidative stress or inflammation. A delayed rise in C-reactive protein was noted with IS. High-dose FDI produced a sustained serum ferritin increase (mean ± standard error of the mean of predose: 69.1 ± 18.4 μg/L, 3 months: 271.0 ± 83.3 μg/L; p = 0.007). Hemoglobin remained stable throughout. No adverse drug reactions were recorded during the study.
CONCLUSION: A single dose of IV iron in CKD patients does not trigger oxidative stress or inflammation biomarkers. Third-generation IV irons have a reassuring safety profile, and high-dose FDI produced a sustained serum ferritin rise and more efficient iron repletion, with no significant pro-oxidant or inflammatory signals when compared to a lower dose and other IV irons.","2021",,"Kidney Res Clin Pract",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"33670704","ESA, Iron Therapy and New Drugs: Are There New Perspectives in the Treatment of Anaemia?","Del Vecchio L","Anemia is a well-known consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD); it is mainly due to a relative insufficiency of erythropoietin synthesis by the failing kidneys. Over the years, the combination of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and iron has become the standard of care of anemia. All ESAs effectively increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels in a substantial percentage of patients. However, in the last decade, their use has been surrounded by safety issues in increased cardiovascular risk, especially when used at high doses in inflamed and hyporesponsive patients. This has led to the definition of a more cautious Hb target. Iron deficiency is very frequent in CKD patients, with a higher frequency in non-dialysis patients. Traditionally, iron supplementation is mostly used as supportive therapy for anemia control. However, the concept is growing that intravenous iron therapy per se could be beneficial in the presence of heart failure. A new class of drugs, prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitors (PHD inhibitors) is becoming available for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients. Theoretically, these agents have a number of advantages, the main ones being that of stimulating the synthesis of endogenous erythropoietin and increasing iron availability. The impact of their future use in clinical practice is still to be defined. Another possible strategy could be targeting serum hepcidin and its related pathways. This possibility is fascinating from the scientific point of view, but at present its development phase is still far from clinical application.","2021",,"J Clin Med",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

There is no reasonable treatment for these conditions, because the effects of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) or iron supplementation in the treatment of anemia are insufficient. JTZ-951 (enarodustat) has been characterized as a novel, orally bioavailable inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH), and has been developed as a novel therapeutic agent for anemia with CKD. In this study, the effects of JTZ-951 on iron utilization during erythropoiesis and on anemia of inflammation were compared with those of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) using normal rat and rat model of anemia of inflammation. In normal rats, under conditions in which JTZ-951 and rHuEPO showed similar erythropoietic effect, repeated doses of JTZ-951 induced erythropoiesis while retaining the hemoglobin content in red blood cells, while administration of rHuEPO resulted in decrease in some erythrocyte-related parameters. As for iron-related parameters during erythropoiesis, JTZ-951 exhibited more efficient iron utilization compared to rHuEPO. A single dose of JTZ-951 resulted in decrease in hepcidin expression observed within 24 h after administration, but a single dose of rHuEPO did not. In a rat model of anemia of inflammation (also known as a model with functional iron-deficiency), JTZ-951 showed erythropoietic effect, in contrast with rHuEPO. These results suggest that, unlike rHuEPO, JTZ-951 stimulates erythropoiesis by increasing iron utilization, and improves anemia of inflammation.","2021",,"Eur J Pharmacol",,"comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

However, the effect of ID on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population is unknown. We analyzed data from a multinational cohort of NDD-CKD Stages 3-5 patients to test the association between transferrin saturation (TSAT) index and ferritin with HRQoL.
METHODS: Patients from Brazil (n = 205), France (n = 2015) and the USA (n = 293) in the Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (CKDopps, 2013-2019) were included. We evaluated the association of TSAT and ferritin (and functional and absolute ID, defined as TSAT ≤20% and ferritin ≥300 or <50 ng/mL) on pre-specified HRQoL measures, including the 36-item Kidney Disease Quality of Life physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) as the primary outcomes. Models were adjusted for confounders including hemoglobin (Hb).
RESULTS: TSAT ≤15% and ferritin <50 ng/mL and ≥300 ng/mL were associated with worse PCS scores, but not with MCS. Patients with composite TSAT ≤20% and ferritin <50 or ≥300 ng/mL had lower functional status and worse PCS scores than those with a TSAT of 20-30% and ferritin 50-299 ng/mL. Patients with a lower TSAT were less likely to perform intense physical activity. Adjustment for Hb only slightly attenuated the observed effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Low TSAT levels, as well as both low TSAT with low ferritin and low TSAT with high ferritin, are associated with worse physical HRQoL in NDD-CKD patients, even after accounting for Hb level.

Among Indigenous Australians in remote areas of the Northern Territory, prevalence rates for renal replacement therapy (RRT) are up to 30 times higher than national prevalence. Anemia among patients with CKD is a common complication. Iron deficiency is one of the major causes. Iron deficiency is also one of the key causes of poor response to the mainstay of anemia therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Therefore, the effective management of anemia in people with CKD is largely dependent on effective identification and correction of iron deficiency. The current identification of iron deficiency in routine clinical practice is dependent on 2 surrogate markers of iron status: serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation (TSAT). However, questions exist regarding the use of serum ferritin concentration in people with CKD because it is an acute-phase reactant that can be raised in the context of acute and chronic inflammation. Serum ferritin concentration among Indigenous Australians receiving RRT is often markedly elevated and falls outside reference ranges within most national and international guidelines for iron therapy for people with CKD. This review explores published data on the challenges of managing anemia in Indigenous people with CKD and the need for future research on the efficacy and safety of treatment of anemia of CKD in patients with high ferritin and evidence iron deficiency.","2021",,"Kidney Int Rep",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The study consisted of 2 experiments, experiment I included healthy dogs (CONT) and CKD dogs (stage 2, 3 and 4), while experiment II consisted of anemic CKD dogs subjected to 28-day darbepoetin alfa treatment. The response to darbepoetin alfa could divide anemic CKD dogs into responder (RP) and non-responder (NRP) subgroups. The results from experiment I showed that packed cell volume (PCV) and plasma albumin concentration were significantly lower in CKD dogs of all stages while the total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was lower in only CKD stage 3 and 4 compared with dogs in CONT group. The PCV was related to both TIBC and albumin when considering among all dogs or only in CKD dogs. The hepcidin concentration in CKD dogs with anemia was lower than those without anemia (P<0.05). In experiment II before darbepoetin alfa treatment, RP subgroup had significantly higher iron and TIBC compared with NRP subgroup (P<0.05), the iron concentration was decreased only in RP subgroup after darbepoetin alfa treatment (P<0.05). The percent increase in PCV was correlated with initial TIBC (P<0.01). Plasma hepcidin concentration was not different between CONT and CKD groups and between RP and NRP subgroups both before and after darbepoetin alfa treatment.

Recent evidence suggests that recombinant hepcidin also mitigates acute renal damage. Hence the goals of this study were to determine whether a new proprietary FeS formulation ('RBT-3') can acutely activate the hepcidin (HAMP1) gene in humans, raising plasma and renal hepcidin concentrations; assess whether the kidney participates in this posited RBT-3-hepcidin generation response; test whether RBT-3 can mitigate a clinically relevant AKI model (experimental cisplatin toxicity) and explore whether mechanisms in addition to hepcidin generation are operative in RBT-3's cytoprotective effects.
METHODS: Healthy human volunteers (n = 9) and subjects with Stages 3-4 CKD (n = 9) received 120, 240 or 360 mg of RBT-3 (intravenously over 2 h). Plasma and urine samples were collected and assayed for hepcidin levels (0-72 h post-RBT-3 injection). In complementary mouse experiments, RBT-3 effects on hepatic versus renal hepcidin (HAMP1) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were compared. RBT-3's impact on the mouse Nrf2 pathway and on experimental cisplatin nephrotoxicity was assessed. Direct effects of exogenous hepcidin on in vivo and in vitro (HK-2 cells) cisplatin toxicity were also tested.
RESULTS: RBT-3 induced rapid, dose-dependent and comparable plasma hepcidin increases in both healthy volunteers and chronic kidney disease subjects (∼15 times baseline within 24 h). Human kidney hepcidin exposure was confirmed by 4-fold urinary hepcidin increases. RBT-3 up-regulated mouse hepcidin mRNA, but much more so in kidney (>25 times) versus liver (∼2 times). RBT-3 also activated kidney Nrf2 [increased Nrf2 nuclear binding; increased Nrf2-responsive gene mRNAs: heme oxygenase-1, sulfiredoxin-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1]. RBT-3 preconditioning (18 h time lapse) markedly attenuated experimental cisplatin nephrotoxicity (∼50% blood urea nitrogen/creatinine decrements), in part by reducing renal cisplatin uptake by 40%. Exogenous hepcidin (without RBT-3) treatment conferred protection against mild in vivo (but not in vitro) cisplatin toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: RBT-3 acutely and dramatically up-regulates cytoprotective hepcidin production, increasing renal hepcidin levels. However, additional cytoprotective mechanisms are activated by RBT-3 (e.g. Nrf2 activation; reduced cisplatin uptake). Thus RBT-3-induced preconditioning likely confers renal resistance to cisplatin via an interplay of multiple cytoprotective activities.","2021",,"Nephrol Dial Transplant",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Oral and intravenous (IV) traditional iron preparations are considered far from ideal, primarily due to gastrointestinal intolerability and the potential risk of infusion reactions, respectively. Fortunately, the emergence of novel iron replacement therapies has engendered a paradigm shift in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with CKD. For example, oral ferric citrate is an efficacious and safe phosphate binder that increases iron stores to maintain hemoglobin levels. Additional benefits include reductions in fibroblast growth factor 23 levels and the activation of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. The new-generation IV iron preparations ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside 1000, and ferric carboxymaltose are characterized by a reduced risk of infusion reactions and are clinically well tolerated as a rapid high-dose infusion. In patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD), ferric pyrophosphate citrate (FPC) administered through dialysate enables the replacement of ongoing uremic and HD-related iron loss. FPC transports iron directly to transferrin, bypassing the reticuloendothelial system and avoiding iron sequestration.

The main problem is timely and accurate differential diagnosis between anemia of chronic diseases and iron deficiency anemia. It is necessary to establish reliable laboratory markers of anemia of chronic diseases in order to solve this problem, as well as to understand what metabolic disorders can lead to the occurrence and aggravate the course of this type of anemia.
AIMS: To study the frequency of occurrence of violations of ferrokinetics in patients with diabetes mellitus, as well as to establish clinical and biochemical correlations that are significant in the differential diagnosis of various disorders of iron metabolism: iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic diseases and dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome in diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research design a single-stage observational single-center research. The research was conducted on the basis of the endocrinological clinic of the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education Siberian State Medical University in Tomsk. The research included 76 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conducted an assessment of all patients as follows: anthropometric data assessment; glycated hemoglobin study; creatinine level study with the calculation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the CKD-EPI formula. We also evaluated the number of erythrocytes, reticulocytes, the hemoglobin concentration, haematocrit level and biochemical parameters of iron metabolism: serum iron and ferritin concentrations; the concentration of hepsidin and non-specific markers of inflammation: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP).
RESULTS: 20 people (26.3%) of the 76 patients included in the study, had type 1 diabetes mellitus and 56 people (73.3%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The parameters of ferrokinetics did not significantly differ in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while in the group of patients with 20 patients (26.3%) from the 76 ones included into the research had type 1 diabetes mellitus and 56 (73.3%) from them had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The parameters of ferrokinetics did not significantly differ in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while in the group of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the levels of CRP (p=0.034) and blood leukocytes (p=0.020) were significantly higher than in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Both in the main group of patients with impaired carbohydrate metabolism, and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, anemia of chronic diseases prevailed in the structure of the anemia syndrome. After dividing the main group of patients into groups by type of anemia syndrome: absence of anemia, anemia of chronic diseases and iron deficiency anemia, a comparative analysis of the average values of markers of inflammation and the level of hepsidin in these groups was performed. It was found that in patients with anemia of chronic diseases, the level of hepsidin is significantly higher than in patients without anemic syndrome (p=0.033). Paired correlation analysis showed a positive correlation of ESR with microalbuminuria (r=0.515; P&lt;0.0001), creatinine level (r=0.467; P&lt;0.0001) and negative &mdash; with GFR (r= -0.436; P&lt;0.0001) and iron in serum (r=-0.276; p=0.017). As the result of ROC analysis the most informative in the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease were: ferritin &mdash; sensitivity 78%, specificity 52% with a diagnostic threshold of 75.5 ng/ml (area under the curve 0,695; p=0.006); ESR &mdash; sensitivity 67%, specificity 64% with a diagnostic threshold of 15.5 mm/HR (area under the curve of 0.750 in; p=0.040) and the CRP &mdash; sensitivity 67%, specificity 64% with a diagnostic threshold of 5.2 ng/ml (area under the curve 0,646; р&lt;0.0001).

We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in iron-deficient ND-CKD patients.
METHODS: This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for ≥12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators' discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received ≤1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions.
RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the ≤1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the ≤1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 appointments per 100 patients compared to ≤1000 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron in this study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg.
CONCLUSIONS: The >1000 mg iron isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the ≤1000 mg regimen. Many of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron were eligible for >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study.

However, the effects of HIF-PHIs on iron regulation have not been consistent among clinical trials. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of six HIF-PHIs on iron regulation in non-dialysis CKD patients. Electronic databases were searched from inception to April 20, 2020, for eligible studies.

Meta-analysis of the included studies showed that, in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, HIF-PHIs decreased TSAT (MD, -4.51; 95 % CI, -5.81 to -3.21), ferritin (MD, -47.29; 95 % CI, -54.59 to -40.00) and hepcidin (SMD, -0.94; 95 % CI, -1.25 to -0.62), increased TIBC (MD, 9.15; 95 % CI, 7.08-11.22), and did not affect serum iron (MD, -0.31; 95 % CI, -2.05 to 1.42) despite enhanced erythropoiesis. This systematic review suggests that HIF-PHIs promote iron utilization in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients. Importantly, HIF-PHIs are associated with increased transferrin levels (and TIBC), leading to reduced TSAT.

Our understanding of the molecular control of iron metabolism has increased dramatically over the past 20 years due to the discovery of hepcidin, which regulates the uptake of dietary iron and its mobilization from macrophages and hepatic stores. Anemia and iron deficiency are common in chronic kidney disease. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic kidney disease is multifactorial. Correction of anemia requires two main treatment strategies: increased stimulation of erythropoiesis, and maintenance of an adequate iron supply to the bone marrow. However, there are still many uncertainties in regard to iron metabolism in patients with chronic kidney disease and in renal replacement therapy. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge on iron metabolism in this population, including new biomarkers of iron status. There is an area of uncertainty regarding diagnostic utility of both erythroferrone (ERFE) and hepcidin in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Higher concentration of hepcidin in oligoanuric patients may reflect decreased renal clearance. Furthermore, the hepcidin-lowering effect of ERFE in ESRD patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may be blunted by underlying inflammation and concomitant iron treatment. Thus, future studies should validate the use of ERFE as a biomarker of erythropoiesis and predictor of response to iron and ESA therapy in dialysis-dependent patients.","2021",,"Int Urol Nephrol"," The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge on iron metabolism in this population , including new biomarkers of iron status "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

It is not clear if growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) or hepcidin are useful as early markers of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) among non-dialysis CKD patients. We therefore evaluated the diagnostic validity of GDF-15 and hepcidin as biomarkers of IDA among non-dialysis CKD patients in Johannesburg, South Africa.
METHOD: An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted among non-dialysis CKD patients (n = 312) and apparently healthy controls (n = 184) from June to December 2016 at an Academic Hospital, in Johannesburg, South Africa. An interviewer administered proforma was used to obtain the socio-biological and clinical characteristics of the participants. Serum levels of GDF-15 and hepcidin were determined. Predictive logistic regression models were built and post estimation receiver operator characteristics were determined to evaluate diagnostic validity of hepcidin and GDF-15 for absolute and functional iron deficiency anaemia.
RESULTS: About half (50.6%) of the participants were female while the participants' mean age was 49.7 ± 15.8 years. The predictive value of diagnosing absolute IDA among CKD patients using GDF-15 was 74.02% (95% CI: 67.62-80.42%) while the predictive value of diagnosing functional IDA among CKD patients using hepcidin was 70.1% (95% CI: 62.79-77.49%).There was a weak negative correlation between hepcidin levels and GFR (r = - 0.19, p = 0.04) in anaemic CKD patients, and between serum GDF-15 and haemoglobin (r = - 0.34, p = 0.001).

RESULTS: Among patients with anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL), 36-58% in Brazil, the USA and Germany had repeat hemoglobin measured and 40-61% had iron indices measured within 3 months of the index hemoglobin measurement. Anemia was more common in the USA and Brazil than in France and Germany across CKD stages.

There are limited options to manage secondary iron overload in patients with CKD as most iron chelators are contraindicated due to low creatinine clearance. In addition to that, accuracy of serum ferritin in monitoring is questionable since it is affected by different variables including inflammation and liver disease. Moreover, correlation of serum ferritin with liver iron concentration (LIC) and heart iron concentration is not well studied in CKD patients. There is no established cut-off value in the current guidelines, and this warrants further investigation with more accurate methods. There are few studies that evaluated the relationship between serum ferritin and LIC determined by different MRI protocols. Limited data in the literature concluded that a positive correlation exists between serum ferritin and LIC determined by MRI T2* and that serum ferritin more than 290 mcg/L is equivalent to severe iron overload on MRI T2*. However, we had a different observation of a patient with CKD on a prolonged course of iron replacement who was monitored with serum ferritin, and despite having a serum ferritin level of more than 1,000 mcg/L, LIC determined by MRI T2* was 5.3 mg/g of liver dry tissue, which is equivalent to mild iron overload.  This observation opens the door for further studies to examine the correlation between serum ferritin and LIC determined by MRI and to establish a safe cut-off value of serum ferritin so that further investigation would be indicated in patients with CKD.","2020",,"Cureus",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Available data from preclinical experiments, observational studies, and randomized controlled trials are summarized to explore the interplay between intravenous iron and infection risk among patients with CKD, particularly those receiving maintenance hemodialysis. The current evidence base, including data from a recent randomized controlled trial, suggests that proactive judicious use of intravenous iron (in a manner that minimizes the accumulation of non-transferrin-bound iron) beneficially replaces iron stores while avoiding a clinically relevant effect on infection risk. In the absence of an urgent clinical need, intravenous iron therapy should be avoided in patients with active infection.

Iron deficiency, absolute and functional, with and without anemia, is associated with adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Heart failure and CKD frequently occur together. Intravenous iron therapy has been shown to reduce heart failure symptoms and improve physical function in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with iron deficiency. In CKD, intravenous or oral iron therapy are often used for management of anemia, along with erythropoiesis stimulating agents, yet the risks and benefits of intravenous iron use is controversial. In this review, we survey available evidence and ongoing studies of iron deficiency and iron supplementation in heart failure, and integrate with recent evidence on effectiveness and safety of intravenous iron therapy in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Intravenous iron therapy improves heart failure symptoms and physical function in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency, regardless of anemia, and may reduce heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Sustained intravenous iron therapy regardless of hemoglobin level in selected patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis improves outcomes, and does not appear to cause infectious complications.

METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02151643), the efficacy and safety of 28 days of oral PT20 treatment were evaluated in patients with dialysis-dependent CKD. Participants were randomly assigned in an 8:8:8:13:13 ratio to receive PT20 (400, 800, 1600 or 3200 mg) or placebo three times daily.
RESULTS: Among 153 participants, 129 completed treatment [7 discontinued because of adverse events (AEs), 2 because of hyperphosphataemia and 15 for other reasons]. PT20 treatment for 28 days resulted in a statistically significant and dose-dependent reduction in serum phosphate concentration.

The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was broadly similar across the PT20 and placebo groups (42-59% versus 44%). The most common PT20 treatment-related AEs were gastrointestinal, primarily diarrhoea (13-18%) and discoloured faeces (3-23%). No serious AEs were considered to be related to study treatment. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory results reflecting acid/base status or increases in ferritin that could indicate the absorption of components of PT20.

However, phosphate binder, ferric citrate (FC) overcomes the CKD-induced impairment of iron absorption and increases serum iron, transferrin saturation, and iron stores and reduces erythropoietin requirements in CKD/ESRD patients. The mechanism and sites of intestinal absorption of iron contained in FC were explored here.
METHODS: Eight-week old rats were randomized to sham-operated or 5/6 nephrectomized (CKD) groups and fed either regular rat chow or rat chow containing 4% FC for 6 weeks. They were then euthanized, and tissues were processed for histological and biochemical analysis using Prussian blue staining, Western blot analysis to quantify intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins and real-time PCR to measure Fatty Acid receptors 2 (FFA2) and 3 (FFA3) expressions.
RESULTS: CKD rats exhibited hypertension, anemia, azotemia, and hyperphosphatemia. FC-treated CKD rats showed significant reductions in blood pressure, serum urea, phosphate and creatinine levels and higher serum iron and blood hemoglobin levels. This was associated with marked increase in iron content of the epithelial and subepithelial wall of the descending colon and modest iron deposits in the proximal tubular epithelial cells of their remnant kidneys. No significant difference was found in hepatic tissue iron content between untreated and FC-treated CKD or control groups. Distal colon's epithelial tight Junction proteins, Occludin, JAM-1 and ZO-1 were markedly reduced in the CKD groups. The FFA2 expression in the jejunum and FFA3 expression in the distal colon were significantly reduced in the CKD rats and markedly increased with FC administration.
CONCLUSION: Iron contained in the phosphate binder, FC, is absorbed by the distal colon of the CKD animals via disrupted colonic epithelial barrier and upregulation of short chain fatty acid transporters.","2020",,"Nephrol Dial Transplant",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Calcium concentrations post ferric citrate treatment did not differ compared to no active treatment (SMD = 0.15; P = 0.21) but were significantly lower compared to other phosphate binders (SMD = -0.14; P = 0.01). These led to significant reductions in calcium-phosphorus product with ferric citrate versus no active control (SMD = -1.02; P < 0.001) but no difference versus active control (SMD = -0.01; P = 0.93). Intact parathyroid hormone showed no substantial between-group difference in both comparison against no active and active controls. Ferric citrate improved iron stores and anaemia parameters, but increased risk of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and discoloured faeces.
CONCLUSION: Ferric citrate was effective in lowering phosphorus and phosphorus-calcium product versus no active treatment and had comparable effects versus other phosphate binders. Calcium levels were significantly lower with ferric citrate than with other phosphate-lowering treatment. Ferric citrate had additive effects on iron repletion and anaemia control and was associated with mostly gastrointestinal side effects.","2021",,"Br J Clin Pharmacol"," AIMS : Phosphate-lowering effects of ferric citrate were reported in several clinical trials , but mostly in small-scale studies ","meta analysis",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

In this manuscript, we put in perspective the newest insights on FGF23 regulation by iron and phosphate and their effects on CKD progression and associated outcomes. We especially focus on new studies aiming to reduce FGF23 levels, and we present new data that suggest major benefits of combined corrections of iron, phosphate, and FGF23 in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: New studies show that simultaneously correcting iron deficiency and hyperphosphatemia in CKD reduces the magnitude of FGF23 increase. Promising therapies using iron-based phosphate binders in CKD might mitigate cardiac and renal injury and improve survival.

Therefore identifying factors associated with mortality could help improve patient management. The impact of iron metabolism, which could be a relevant therapeutic target, yield discrepant results in this setting. Previous studies suggest that increased serum ferritin is associated with higher mortality. Surprisingly iron deficiency which is a well described risk factor in critically ill patients has not been considered.
AIM: To assess the impact of pre-transplant iron metabolism parameters on post-transplant survival.
METHODS: From 2001 to 2011, 553 patients who underwent LT with iron metabolism parameters available at LT evaluation were included. Data were prospectively recorded at the time of evaluation and at the time of LT regarding donor and recipient. Serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) were studied as continuous and categorical variable. Cox regression analysis was used to determine mortality risks factors. Follow-up data were obtained from the local and national database regarding causes of death.
RESULTS: At the end of a 95-mo median follow-up, 196 patients were dead, 38 of them because of infections. In multivariate analysis, overall mortality was significantly associated with TS > 75% [HR: 1.73 (1.14; 2.63)], SF < 100 µg/L [HR: 1.62 (1.12; 2.35)], hepatocellular carcinoma [HR: 1.58 (1.15; 2.26)], estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD EPI Cystatin C) [HR: 0.99 (0.98; 0.99)], and packed red blood cell transfusion [HR: 1.05 (1.03; 1.08)]. Kaplan Meier curves show that patients with low SF (< 100 µg/L) or high SF (> 400 µg/L) have lower survival rates at 36 mo than patients with normal SF (

Iron supplementation is a crucial part of the treatment of anemia in CKD patients, and intravenous (IV) iron supplementation is considered to be superior to per os (PO) iron supplementation. The differences between the available formulations are poorly characterized. This report presents results from pairwise and network meta-analyses carried out after a comprehensive search in sources of published and unpublished studies, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations (International prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO reference ID: CRD42020148155). Meta-analytic calculations were performed for the outcome of non-response to iron supplementation (i.e., hemoglobin (Hgb) increase of <0.5-1.0 g/dL, or initiation/intensification of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy, or increase/change of iron supplement, or requirements of blood transfusion). A total of 34 randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified, providing numerical data for analyses covering 93.7% (n = 10.097) of the total study population. At the network level, iron supplementation seems to have a more protective effect against the outcome of non-response before the start of dialysis than once dialysis is initiated, and some preparations seem to be more potent (e.g., ferumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose), compared to the rest of iron supplements assessed (surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) > 0.8).

,"32348985","Protocol and Baseline Data of a Multicentre Prospective Double-Blinded Randomized Study of Intravenous Iron on Functional Status in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.","Bhandari S","BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to an inadequate dietary intake of iron, poor absorption from the gut and increased iron losses. In addition to preventing anaemia, iron is important for normal heart function, being involved in processes that generate a necessary continuous energy supply. Treatment with intravenous (IV) iron has been suggested to lead to improvement in heart function and well-being in people with ID and CKD. In the Iron and the Heart Study, we hypothesized that IV iron treatment will primarily improve exercise capacity and may secondarily impact the feeling of well-being in comparison to placebo over 3 months in non-anaemic CKD patients who have ID.
METHODS: This was a prospective double-blinded explorative randomized, multi-centre study designed to compare the effects of IV iron supplementation and placebo in iron-deficient but not anaemic patients with established CKD stages 3b-5 on functional status, and in addition cardiac structure and function. The study included 54 adults with serum ferritin (SF) <100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation <20%, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1,000 mg IV ferric derisomaltose or placebo. Following randomization, participants underwent baseline assessments and then received IV iron or placebo infusion. Each participant was followed up at months 1 and 3. At each visit, patients underwent clinical review, measurements of hematinics and haemoglobin (Hb), and assessments of physical function and well-being. The primary outcome was exercise capacity using the 6-minute walk test. Secondary objectives included effects on hematinic profiles and Hb concentration, changes in myocardial parameters assessed with speckle tracking echocardiography and change in patients' quality of life.
RESULTS: Between October 2016 and April 2018, 55 from 326 individuals from 3 UK centres attended screening and were randomized. The mean (SD) age was 59.6 (11.7) years, 26 (48%) patients were male, the majority were Caucasians (42; 78%), and 32 (59%) were non-smokers. The mean (SD) body mass index was 30.3 (6.5); SF was 66.3 (44.1) µg/L, TS was 20.1 (7.4) % and Hb was 128.7 (10.1) g/L at randomization for the whole group. Mean (SD) serum creatinine was 186.7 (58.6) µmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate was 31.1 (9.6) mL/min/1.73 m2 and urinary albumin and protein/creatinine ratios 60.9 (133.3) and 83.8 (128.4) mg/mmol respectively. The mean (SD) C-reactive protein was 5.0 (4.4) mg/L and the mean (SD) 6-minute walk distance at baseline was 401.2 (120.2) m.
CONCLUSION: The Iron and the Heart Trial will provide important information on the short-term effects of IV iron treatment in CKD patients with ID without anaemia on measures of exercise capacity, quality of life and mechanistic data on myocardial structure and function.

Iron sucrose (IS) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) are 2 frequently used formulations. Experimental data showed that this 2 intravenous iron preparations have different potential to induce oxidative stress and by that endothelial dysfunction. Still, direct comparisons in clinical settings are rather scarce.
STUDY QUESTION: Are there any acute changes in endothelial function after single intravenous iron infusions of IS and FCM in nondialysis CKD patients?
STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, crossover study in which 31 patients with CKD stages 3-5 (80% stages 3 and 4, 81% female, 55% older than 60 years, 23% diabetes mellitus, and 94% arterial hypertension) who required intravenous iron as part of their routine medical care were enrolled.
MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: The effect of flow-mediated vasodilatation infusions containing 250-mL 10% glucose, 500-mg FCM, and 200-mg IS, both in 250-mL 0.9% saline solution, was compared. The infusions were administered over 30 minutes, 72 hours apart, in the mentioned order. Ultrasound measurement of the brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) performed 15 minutes before and after each infusion was used to assess endothelial function. The outcome was the post/preinfusion difference (Δ) in FMD.
RESULTS: The baseline FMD was similar before each study intervention. The arterial reactivity significantly decreased only after IS infusion [ΔFMD -2.3 (-5.65 to -0.33) vs. 1.0 (-1.49 to 1.80) after glucose, P = 0.01], but not after FCM [ΔFMD -0.8 (-2.50 to 0.65), P = 0.27 vs. glucose].

Thereafter we review the dysregulation of iron metabolism in CKD. Specific emphasis is placed on the role of the 'inflammatory' state that develops with the progression of CKD. It invokes changes in iron metabolism that are the exact opposite of those occurring during pure iron deficiency. As a result, transferrin saturation (TSAT) becomes a poorer index of iron availability to the bone marrow and serum ferritin no longer represents iron that can be used during erythropoiesis. We argue that serum iron may provide more information to guide iron therapy than TSAT. In other words, the emphasis on TSAT is misplaced. With the development of a number of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which restore iron metabolism toward the 'physiologic state', the iron indices indicating sufficient iron availability to avoid functional iron deficiency during therapy of CKD-associated anemia are likely to change.

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A hospital-based cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 175 adult patients with stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) by using 51 healthy age-sex-matched Vietnamese adults as the control group. We next examined the prevalence of anemia and determined the serum iron and ferritin concentrations and TIBC. Anemia in CKD was defined as hemoglobin levels <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. Transferrin saturation (TSAT, %) was calculated as (serum iron x 100)/TIBC. Functional iron deficiency was defined as serum ferritin >100 ng/mL and TSAT <20%, and absolute iron deficiency was defined as serum ferritin <100 ng/mL and TSAT <20%. Overall iron deficiency was defined as the presence of either absolute or functional iron deficiency.
RESULTS: Anemia prevalence in our study was approximately 88.6% with a mean hemoglobin concentration of 9.71±2.26 g/dL. The median serum TIBC was lower in the CKD group (50.4 μmol/L) than in the control group (66.0 μmol/L; p<0.001). The proportion of overall iron deficiency was 44.0%.

Iron metabolism in HF appears dysregulated, but it is still unclear whether the changes are maladaptive and pathologic or compensatory and protective for the cardiomyocytes. The serum markers of iron deficiency in HF do not accurately reflect cellular and mitochondrial iron levels, and the current definition based on the ferritin and transferrin saturation values is broad and inclusive of patients who do not need IV iron. This is particularly relevant in view of the potential risks that are associated with the use of IV iron.

Sucrosomial® iron, a new generation oral iron with high absorption and bioavailability and a low incidence of side effects, has shown to be not inferior to intravenous (IV) iron in the replacement of iron deficiency anemia in patients with ND-CKD. Besides the clinical benefit, it is also important to determine the comparative total costs of oral versus IV iron administrations. The aim of this study was to perform a cost-minimization analysis of oral Sucrosomial iron, compared with IV iron gluconate from an Italian societal perspective.
METHODS: Cost analysis was performed on the 99 patients with ND-CKD and iron-deficiency anemia of the randomized trial by Pisani et al. Human and material resources utilization was recorded during each iron administration. According to study perspective, direct and indirect costs were considered. Costs for each resource unit were taken from official Italian sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The base case analysis showed an average cost/cycle per patient of € 111 for oral iron and € 1302 for IV iron. Thus, the potential saving was equal to € 1191 per patient/cycle. The sensitivity analysis showed that the most sensitive driver is the time loss by patient and caregivers for the therapy and related-care, followed by the minutes of nursing care and the number of kilometres travelled to reach the referral centre.

This may be due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation.

In Normal rat study, normal rats were fed a diet containing 0.3 or 3% ferric citrate for 11 days for setting the dose and administration period of ferric citrate. The effects of ferric citrate on iron status- and phosphorus metabolism-related parameters were evaluated using blood and urine samples.

After 7 days of starting the iron-depleted diet, 0.3% ferric citrate was administered for 7 days by dietary admixture. Iron status- and phosphorus metabolism-related parameters were evaluated with blood and urine samples. In Normal rat study, 3% ferric citrate treatment increased serum iron level and transferrin saturation (TSAT), and decreased serum phosphorus level, intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23) level, and urinary phosphorus excretion, but 0.3% ferric citrate treatment showed no effects.

CVD is often associated with vascular calcification, which has been attributed to hyperphosphatemia, and could be initiated in mitochondria, inducing apoptosis, and accelerated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The production of ROS is principally linked to intracellular ferrous iron. For infection, the virulence and pathogenicity of a pathogen is directly related to its capacity to acquire iron for proliferation and to escape or subvert the host's immune response. Iron administration for renal anemia can sometimes be overdosed, which could decrease host immune mechanisms through its direct effect on neutrophils, macrophages and T cell function. Hyperphosphatemia has been demonstrated to be associated with an increased incidence of infection. We hypothesized two possible mechanisms: 1) fibroblast growth factor-23 levels are increased in parallel with serum phosphate levels and directly impair leukocyte recruitment and host defense mechanisms, and 2) circulating non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) is increased due to decreased iron binding capacity of the carrier protein transferrin in high-phosphate conditions. From these observations, maintaining an adequate serum range of phosphate levels and minimizing intracellular iron accumulation could attenuate the development of CKD complications.","2020",,"Free Radic Biol Med",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

We evaluated the effect of twelve weeks of supplementation with resveratrol and curcumin on recovery of bone and muscle mass and protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation on patients with chronic kidney disease and iron overload undergoing hemodialysis, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
METHODS: We included a total of 40 patients, were randomly assigned to two groups, 20 to the group with antioxidant supplementation (Resveratrol + Curcumin) (Group A), treated with a daily oral dose of 500 mg of Resveratrol and 500 mg of Curcumin, and 20 to the control group treated with placebo (Group B).
RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the body composition of the patients between both groups. There was a significant difference in Body Mass Index (BMI) values (p = 0.002), fat percentage (p = 0.007), muscle mass (p = 0.01) bone mass (p = 0.01), as well as in the score of the subjective global evaluation (p = 0.03). Also differences were found between the basal and final serum levels of Triglycerides (TG) (p = 0.01), VLDL (p = 0.003). A significant decrease in the levels of serum ferritin (2003.69 ± 518.73 vs 1795.65 ± 519.00 ng/mL; p = 0.04).

We examined the association of absolute and functional iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with adverse outcomes (cardiovascular hospitalization, dialysis and mortality) in those with nondialysis-dependent CKD.
METHODS: Nondialysis-dependent CKD patients followed in the US Veterans Administration with hemoglobin level measured within 90 days of the date of the second estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included. Logistic regression, multivariate Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models adjusted for demographics and comorbidities were used to assess the prevalence and correlates of absolute [transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤20%, ferritin <100 ng/mL] and functional (TSA T≤20%, ferritin >100-500 ng/mL) IDA and the associations of absolute and functional IDA with mortality, dialysis and cardiovascular hospitalization.
RESULTS: Of 933 463 patients with CKD, 20.6% had anemia. Among those with anemia, 23.6% of patients had both TSAT and ferritin level measured, of whom 30% had absolute IDA and 19% had functional IDA. Absolute IDA in CKD was not associated with an increased risk of mortality or dialysis but was associated with a higher risk of 1-year {risk ratio [RR] 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.28]} and 2-year cardiovascular hospitalization [RR 1.11 (95% CI 1.05-1.17)]. CKD patients with functional IDA had a higher risk of mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.14)] along with a higher risk of 1-year [RR 1.21 (95% CI 1.1-1.30)] and 2-year cardiovascular hospitalization [RR 1.13 (95% CI 1.07-1.21)]. Ferritin >500 ng/mL (treated as a separate category) was only associated with an increased risk of mortality [HR 1.38 (95% CI 1.26-1.51)].

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), a common complication in CKD, is associated with poor clinical outcomes affecting mitochondrial function and exacerbating oxidative stress. Intravenous (iv) iron, that is used to treat anaemia, may lead to acute systemic oxidative stress. This study evaluated the impact of iv iron on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress.
METHODS: Uraemia was induced surgically in male Sprague-Dawley rats and studies were carried out 12 weeks later in two groups sham operated and uraemic (5/6 nephrectomy) rats not exposed to i.v. iron versus sham operated and uraemic rats with iv iron.
RESULTS: Induction of uraemia resulted in reduced iron availability (serum iron: 31.1 ± 1.8 versus 46.4 ± 1.4 µM), low total iron binding capacity (26.4 ± 0.7 versus 29.5 ± 0.8 µM), anaemia (haematocrit: 42.5 ± 3.0 versus 55.0 ± 3.0%), cardiac hypertrophy, reduced systemic glutathione peroxidase activity (1.12 ± 0.11 versus 1.48 ± 0.12 U/mL), tissue oxidative stress (oxidised glutathione: 0.50 ± 0.03 versus 0.36 ± 0.04 nmol/mg of tissue), renal mitochondrial dysfunction (proton/electron leak: 61.8 ± 8.0 versus 22.7 ± 5.77) and complex I respiration (134.6 ± 31.4 versus 267.6 ± 26.4 pmol/min/µg).

,"31619363","High-phosphate induced vascular calcification is reduced by iron citrate through inhibition of extracellular matrix osteo-chondrogenic shift in VSMCs.","Ciceri P","BACKGROUND: High serum phosphate (Pi) levels strongly associate with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with vascular calcification playing a major role in the pathogenesis of related cardiovascular disease. High-Pi challenged vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo simil-osteoblastic transformation and actively deposit calcium-phosphate crystals. Iron-based Pi-binders are used to treat hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the direct effect of iron citrate on extracellular matrix (ECM) modification induced by high-Pi, following either prophylactic or therapeutic approach.
RESULTS: Iron prophylactically prevents and therapeutically blocks high-Pi induced calcification. Masson's staining highlights the changes of muscular ECM that after high-Pi stimulation becomes fibrotic and which modifications are prevented or partially reverted by iron. Interestingly, iron preserves glycogen granules and either prevents or partially reverts the formation of non-glycogen granules induced by high-Pi. In parallel, iron addition is able to either prevent or block the high-Pi induced acid mucin deposition. Iron inhibited calcification also by preventing exosome osteo-chondrogenic shift by reducing phosphate load (0,61 ± 0.04vs0,45 ± 0.05, PivsPi + Fe, p < 0,05, nmol Pi/mg protein) and inducing miRNA 30c (0.62 ± 0.05vs3.07 ± 0.62; PivsPi + Fe, p < 0.01, relative expression). Studying aortic rings, we found that iron significantly either prevents or reverts the high-Pi induced collagen deposition and the elastin decrease, preserving elastin structure (0.7 ± 0.1 vs 1.2 ± 0.1; Pi vs Pi + Fe, p < 0.05, elastin mRNA relative expression).
CONCLUSIONS: Iron directly either prevents or partially reverts the high-Pi induced osteo-chondrocytic shift of ECM.

This is controversial because of higher costs and risks compared with oral iron supplementation (OIS). In this study, we aimed to investigate indications for OIS and IVIS in Swiss general practice and test which factors are associated with prescribing IVIS instead of OIS.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using data from electronic medical records of 279 Swiss general practitioners (GPs), including all their patients at their first OIS and IVIS administration who were at least 14 years old and with available pretreatment serum ferritin and haemoglobin measurements. We also collected data about the following comorbidities: chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b or higher, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic heart failure and restless legs syndrome. Outcomes were proportions of cases treated with IVIS or OIS by assumed indication (anaemic or non-anaemic iron deficiency [NAID]) or the abovementioned comorbidities. We evaluated associations with IVIS prescription using regression models adjusting for patient and GP variables.
RESULTS: We assessed 1282 IVIS and 3003 OIS cases (median age 44 and 40 years, female in 86.7 and 88.6%, respectively). The most important indication for both IVIS and OIS was NAID (59.4 and 74.7%, respectively). Significant associations with prescribing IVIS instead of OIS were the severity of iron deficiency (reflected by serum ferritin levels and the presence of anaemia), the presence of advanced CKD, IBD and male sex of the GP. There was a time trend towards increasing serum ferritin levels associated with initiation of IVIS in NAID.
CONCLUSION: When preferring IVIS to OIS, Swiss GPs seem to consider severity of iron deficiency and comorbid conditions. However, pretreatment serum ferritin levels in IVIS for NAID are increasing, suggesting an ongoing indication extension and potential overuse.","2019",,"Swiss Med Wkly"," In this study , we aimed to investigate indications for OIS and IVIS in Swiss general practice and test which factors are associated with prescribing IVIS instead of OIS ","observational study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The increase in the number of cases of hemosiderosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD) attributed to excessive intravenous iron replacement has called for the investigation of the factors involved in the genesis of FID.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of FID in patients with CKD on HD, characterize the included individuals in terms of clinical and workup parameters, and assess their nutritional, oxidative stress, and inflammation statuses. This cross-sectional study assembled a convenience sample of 183 patients with CKD on HD treated in Southern Brazil. Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into two groups, one with anemic subjects with FID and one with anemic patients without FID. Participants answered a questionnaire probing into socio-epidemiological factors, underwent anthropometric measurements, and were tested for markers of anemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nutrition.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The date sets were treated on software package GraphPad InStat version 3.1. Variables were tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, chi-square, Student's t, and Mann-Whitney tests. Statistical significance was attributed to differences with a p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Markers of inflammation were not statistically different between the two groups. Markers of anemia and nutrition were significantly lower in patients with FID. Patients with FID were prescribed higher doses of parenteral iron (p < 0,05).

The iron deficiency is an important contributor, more so in the Indian population. As routine standalone iron tests do not accurately reflect the actual status in the complex environment of CKD, there is a need to study better indicators. Serum iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels were estimated in 100 primary iron deficiency anemia (IDA) patients (controls-Group 1) and 68 newly diagnosed CKD cases. The CKD patients were divided into two groups: Serum ferritin <=100 μg/L (Group 2) and >100 μg/L (Group 3). The values of percentage saturation, log of ferritin (log_ferritin), and the ratio of sTfR to log ferritin (sTfR/log_f or sTfR index) were calculated. The CKD cases were further divided depending on ferritin cut-offs of 30, 50, 70, and 100 μg/L and statistically analyzed including ROC and AUC, to choose the best diagnostic parameter for accurate assessment of iron status in CKD cases. The mean serum ferritin was 11.34 μg/L, 28.70 μg/L, and 281.81 μg/L, and the mean sTfR was 2.34 μg/ml, 1.82 μg/ml, and 1.28 μg/ml in Groups 1, 2, and 3. Among all groups, the difference was found to be significant for serum iron, log_ferritin, and sTfR/log_f. The sTfR and sTfR/log_f showed good discrimination between IDA and Anemia of chronic disease in CKD cases, but sTfR/log_f gave the best discrimination at all cut-off levels of ferritin. At a ferritin cut-off of 50 μg/L, the sTfR/log_f value of 0.83 had a sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 95.45%, and at a ferritin cut-off 100 μg/L, the same value of 0.83 had a sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 86.5%.

Molidustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, has potential to treat anemia associated with CKD through increased erythropoietin production and improved iron availability. Here, we report the effect of molidustat on iron metabolism.
METHOD: Parameters of iron metabolism were monitored in three 16-week, randomized, controlled, phase 2 studies assessing the safety and efficacy of molidustat in the treatment of anemia associated with CKD in different populations: treatment-naïve and previously ESA-treated patients not on dialysis, and previously ESA-treated patients on hemodialysis. Iron supplementation was left at the discretion of the investigator.
RESULTS: In treatment-naïve patients not on dialysis, transferrin saturation (TSAT), hepcidin, ferritin, and iron concentrations decreased with molidustat, whereas total iron binding capacity (TIBC) increased. Similar results were observed in previously ESA-treated patients not on dialysis, although changes in those parameters were larger in treatment-naïve than in previously ESA-treated patients. In previously ESA-treated patients receiving hemodialysis, hepcidin concentration and TIBC remained stable with molidustat, whereas TSAT and ferritin and iron concentrations increased. Generally, similar trends were observed in secondary analyses of subgroups of patients not receiving iron supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Molidustat is a potential alternative to standard treatment of anemia associated with CKD, with a different mechanism of action. In patients not receiving dialysis, molidustat increases iron availability. In patients receiving hemodialysis, further investigation is required to understand fully the mechanisms underlying iron mobilization associated with molidustat.","2019",,"Nephron","BACKGROUND / AIMS : The current treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) includes the administration of erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) combined with iron supplementation ","clinical trial",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Therefore, we performed a historical cohort study using data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse to evaluate the relationship between iron status and mortality. We identified a pre-dialysis CKD cohort with at least one set of iron indices between 2006-2015. The cohort was divided into four iron groups based on the joint quartiles of serum transferrin saturation (percent) and ferritin concentration (ng/ml): reference (16-28%, 55-205 ng/ml), low iron (0.4-16%, 0.4-55 ng/ml), high iron (28-99.6%, 205-4941 ng/ml), and function iron deficiency (0.8-16%, 109-2783 ng/ml). We compared mortality risk between the iron groups using matching weights based on multinomial propensity score models and Poisson rate-based regression. We also evaluated if the association between iron groups and mortality differs between the diabetic and non-diabetic subgroups. Of the 80,067 eligible veterans, 32,489 were successfully matched. During the mean follow-up period of 4.0 years, adjusted relative rate (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality in three abnormal iron groups were increased compared to the reference: functional iron deficiency [1.21 (1.17, 1.25)], low iron [1.10 (1.07, 1.14)], and high iron [1.09 (1.06, 1.13)]. The mortality risk was similar between diabetic and non-diabetic subgroups for each iron group.

,"31170159","Iron deficiency, elevated erythropoietin, fibroblast growth factor 23, and mortality in the general population of the Netherlands: A cohort study.","Eisenga MF","BACKGROUND: Emerging data in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients suggest that iron deficiency and higher circulating levels of erythropoietin (EPO) stimulate the expression and concomitant cleavage of the osteocyte-derived, phosphate-regulating hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a risk factor for premature mortality. To date, clinical implications of iron deficiency and high EPO levels in the general population, and the potential downstream role of FGF23, are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine the associations between iron deficiency and higher EPO levels with mortality, and the potential mediating role of FGF23, in a cohort of community-dwelling subjects.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed 6,544 community-dwelling subjects (age 53 ± 12 years; 50% males) who participated in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study-a prospective population-based cohort study, of which we used the second survey (2001-2003)-and follow-up was performed for a median of 8 years. We measured circulating parameters of iron status, EPO levels, and plasma total FGF23 levels. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. In multivariable linear regression analyses, ferritin (ß = -0.43), transferrin saturation (TSAT) (ß = -0.17), hepcidin (ß = -0.36), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR; ß = 0.33), and EPO (ß = 0.28) were associated with FGF23 level, independent of potential confounders. During median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up of 8.2 (7.7-8.8) years, 379 (6%) subjects died. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, lower levels of TSAT (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 standard deviation [SD], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.95; P = 0.004) and higher levels of sTfR (HR, 1.15; 95% CI 1.03-1.28; P = 0.01), EPO (HR, 1.17; 95% CI 1.05-1.29; P = 0.004), and FGF23 (HR, 1.20; 95% CI 1.10-1.32; P < 0.001) were each significantly associated with an increased risk of death, independent of potential confounders. Adjustment for FGF23 levels markedly attenuated the associations of TSAT (HR, 0.89; 95% CI 0.78-1.01; P = 0.06), sTfR (HR, 1.08; 95% CI 0.96-1.20; P = 0.19), and EPO (HR, 1.10; 95% CI 0.99-1.22; P = 0.08) with mortality. FGF23 remained associated with mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.27; P = 0.008) after adjustment for TSAT, sTfR, and EPO levels. Mediation analysis indicated that FGF23 explained 31% of the association between TSAT and mortality; similarly, FGF23 explained 32% of the association between sTfR and mortality and 48% of the association between EPO and mortality (indirect effect P < 0.05 for all analyses). The main limitations of this study were the observational study design and the absence of data on intact FGF23 (iFGF23), precluding us from discerning whether the current results are attributable to an increase in iFGF23 or in C-terminal FGF23 fragments.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, we found that functional iron deficiency and higher EPO levels were each associated with an increased risk of death in the general population.

,"30991401","Iron Metabolism in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.","Honda H","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and occurs due to diminished renal function. The main cause of such anemia is decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production and secretion from the kidney and a lower erythropoietic response to EPO. Treatment therefore involves erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Optimal erythropoietic response to ESA therapy also requires adequate iron management. However, iron metabolism is also dysregulated in CKD patients.
SUMMARY: During erythropoiesis, biomarkers of iron metabolism are dramatically altered by ESA therapy. Hepcidin 25 is a key hormone of iron metabolism that regulates iron absorption from the gut and the release of stored iron out of reticuloendothelial system cells. Recently, erythroferrone has been identified as an erythroid suppressor of hepcidin 25 production. Because erythroferrone levels are significantly increased by ESA treatment in CKD patients, it may be a key factor in facilitating the release of stored iron into the circulation during erythropoiesis in these patients. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of the important biomarkers of iron metabolism in CKD patients and the changes in these biomarkers after ESA administration. Key Messages: In CKD patients, the management of anemia with ESA therapy requires comprehensive assessment of the levels of various biomarkers, with consideration of their optimal and physiological levels during erythropoiesis.","2019",,"Contrib Nephrol",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"30970355","Iron Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease.","Gafter-Gvili A","Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD patients suffer from both absolute and functional iron deficiency. Absolute iron deficiency is defined by severely reduced or absent iron stores, while functional iron deficiency is defined by adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability for incorporation into erythroid precursors. This is due to increased levels of hepcidin. Anemia in CKD is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The association between anemia and mortality may be related to the severity of anemia. All CKD patients should be screened for anemia during the initial evaluation for CKD. Criteria used to define iron deficiency are different among CKD compared to normal renal function. Among CKD patients, absolute iron deficiency is defined when the transferrin saturation (TSAT) is ≤20% and the serum ferritin concentration is ≤100 ng/mL among predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients or ≤200 ng/mL among hemodialysis patients. Functional iron deficiency, also known as iron-restricted erythropoiesis, is characterized by TSAT ≤20% and elevated ferritin levels. Iron supplementation is recommended for all CKD patients with anemia. There is general agreement according to guidelines that intravenous (i.v.) iron supplementation is the preferred method for CKD patients on dialysis (CKD stage 5D) and either i.v. or oral iron is recommended for patients with CKD ND (CKD stages 3-5). In this review we discuss the evidence base for these recommendations.","2019",,"Acta Haematol",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"30947751","Protocol and baseline data for a prospective open-label explorative randomized single-center comparative study to determine the effects of various intravenous iron preparations on markers of oxidative stress and kidney injury in chronic kidney disease (IRON-CKD).","Ziedan A","BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) iron is frequently used to treat iron deficiency/anemia in patients who are unable to tolerate oral iron or the oral iron is not sufficient toreplete iron requirements. However, safety concerns regarding the potential increase in oxidative stress and other adverse effects persist and it remains unclear whether all iron preparations are equivalent. Indeed, the comparative risk of adverse events with IV iron preparations has not been extensively assessed. We hypothesize that IV iron leads to changes in oxidative stress, endothelial function, and potential renal damage depending on the iron formulation (related to the generation of ""free"" or catalytic labile iron) and this may result in more tubular and glomerular injury manifested as increased proteinuria and raised neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: IRON-CKD is a prospective, open-label, explorative, randomized, single-center study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of three parenteral iron preparations: low-molecular-weight iron dextran-Cosmofer, iron sucrose-Venofer, and iron isomaltoside-Monofer. The study includes 40 adults who have established CKD stages 3-5 and serum ferritin (SF) of less than 200 μg/L or transferrin saturation (TS) of less than 20% (or both); they were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 200 mg iron dextran, 200 mg iron sucrose, 200 mg iron isomaltoside, or 1000 mg iron isomaltoside. After randomization, participants undergo baseline assessments and then an iron infusion. Each participant is followed up at 2 h, day 1, week 1, and months 1 and 3. At each follow-up visit, patients undergo clinical review, measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), blood tests for renal function, and collection of serum/plasma samples for oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. The primary outcomes are measures of oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and markers of acute renal injury in comparison with baseline measures of each iron preparation and between each of the iron preparations. Secondary objectives include effects on hematinic profiles and hemoglobin concentrations, changes in arterial stiffness, incidence of significant side effects, and change in patients' quality of life.
RESULTS: Between October 2015 and April 2018, 521 individuals were identified as potential participants; 216 were contacted, 56 expressed an interest, 49 attended a screening visit, and 40 were confirmed to meet the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned. The mean age was 58.8 (standard error of the mean 2.2) years, and 23 (58%) were male. All patients were white and English-speaking. The mean SF was 68.8 μg/L, TS was 21.4%, and haemoglobin was 122.6 g/L at randomization for the whole group. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 28.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 the urinary protein/ creatinine ratio was 154.2 mg/mmol, and CRP was 7.5 mg/L.
DISCUSSION: IRON-CKD will provide important information on the short-term effects of three preparations of IV iron in CKD patients with biochemical functional or absolute iron deficiency on measures of oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function, and renal injury.

In order to assess this strategy in clinical practice, we constituted a cohort of patients within our nephrology department.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had CKD stages 3 to 5, hemoglobin level (Hb)<13g/dL (men) or<12g/dL (women), and ferritin level (F)<100ng/mL or transferrin saturation (TSAT)<20%. They were not treated by erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) for at least one month, and oral iron had been poorly tolerated or ineffective. FCM first dose was adjusted according to patient weight. A new infusion was possible, at least one month after the first, with a half-dose if TSAT<20% but F≥200ng/mL; no perfusion was performed if F≥400ng/mL.
RESULTS: In all, 53 patients were included with a mean Hb of 11.4g/dL and a mean TSAT of 16%.

Patients with IDA and CKD undergoing hemodialysis were randomized 2:1 to ferumoxytol 1.02 g (2 × 510 mg) or iron sucrose 1.0 g (10 × 100 mg) for a 5-week treatment period (TP). Over 11 months, patients underwent additional 5-week TPs whenever IDA (hemoglobin < 11.5 g/dL and transferrin saturation < 30%) was detected. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to week 5 for each TP. Adverse events were recorded during the study.
RESULTS: Overall, 293 patients received ferumoxytol (n = 196) or iron sucrose (n = 97). Ferumoxytol was noninferior to iron sucrose regarding hemoglobin change from baseline to week 5.

METHODS: Thirty six statin- and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-naive patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 and LDL cholesterol ≥100 mg/dl received atorvastatin or placebo for two 6-month periods in a double blind, randomized crossover study. Hepcidin, hemojuvelin, hsCRP, IL-6, hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) were measured before and after each treatment period.
RESULTS: Hepcidin decreased (from 102 [307] to 63 [170] pg/ml (p > .001)) in the course of statin therapy but remained unchanged after placebo administration (173 [256] to 153 [204] pg/ml, respectively). Hemojuvelin did not change after either part of the study. Both IL-6 and hsCRP decreased following statin therapy (from 8.7 [12.0] to 8.1 [13.9] pg/ml; p = .04 and from 4.7 [4.0] to 4.0 [3.6] mg/l; p = .4, respectively), but did not change after placebo administration.

This study assessed treatment routine, effectiveness, and safety of iron isomaltoside (IIM) 5% (Diafer®) in a HD cohort.
METHODS: This prospective observational study included 198 HD patients converted from iron sucrose (IS) and treated with IIM according to product label and clinical routine. Data for IIM were compared to historic data for IS in 3-month intervals. The primary endpoint was to show non-inferiority for IIM versus IS in haemoglobin (Hb) maintenance.
RESULTS: Most patients (> 60%) followed a fixed low-dose iron treatment protocol. Three minutes were required for preparation and administration of IIM. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) was used in > 80% of patients during both IIM and IS phases. The maintenance of Hb was similar with both iron drugs; the mean Hb level was 11 g/dL, and the mean change of 0.3 g/dL (95% confidence interval: 0.1, 0.5) for IIM 0-3 months compared to IS demonstrated non-inferiority. Nine adverse drug reactions were reported in 2% of patients administered IIM. All patients had uneventful recoveries. The frequency of metallic taste was higher with IS compared to IIM (34% versus 0.5%, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: IIM is effective and well tolerated by CKD patients on HD. IIM was non-inferior to IS in maintenance of Hb, and had similar ESA requirements. The fast-push injection of IIM may enable logistical benefits in clinical practice, and the low frequency of metallic taste contributes to patient convenience.

Moreover, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-known comorbidity of HF and is strongly associated with the risk of developing anaemia. The most common cause of HF in dogs is myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the iron status in dogs with HF, with and without CKD. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the iron status in dogs affected by MMVD and how strong is the relation with HF. The retrospective study included 54 dogs with complete case records, echocardiography and laboratory analyses. Iron status was evaluated by measuring serum iron concentration (SIC), un- saturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and percentage of saturation (%SAT). The prevalence of dogs showing low serum iron concentration (SIC) was 18% in the whole population, 33% in symptomatic patients, 100% in dogs with acute decompensated HF.

However, while the haemoglobin level is unreliable for early detection of IDA, reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr) and hypochromic red cells (%HYPO) are early markers of IDA.
METHODS: This was a cross sectional study of black adult participants (n = 258) with CKD and apparently healthy members of staff and patients' relatives (n = 141) at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa, between 1 June 2016 and 31 December 2016. Serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin were measured using standard laboratory methods, while the haematology analyser was employed to measure CHr and %HYPO. The validity of CHr and %HYPO as markers of IDA were evaluated. Multivariable binary logistic regression was conducted to determine predictors of the relationship between IDA, CHr and %HYPO. The area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of the final models were utilised to evaluate the discriminatory value of CHr and %HYPO respectively.
RESULTS: About one-quarter (26.1%) of the participants had IDA which was more than three times more frequent among CKD patients, compared to controls (35.3% vs 9.2%); 32.3% (95%CI: 27.90%- 37.10%) of the study population had iron deficiency without anaemia and the prevalence of iron deficiency without anaemia was lower in CKD patients compared to controls (29.5% vs 37.6%).

The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IDA among CKD participants was 62.6% and 80.2% respectively for CHr (at a cut-off value of <28pg) and 63.3% and 79.8% respectively for %HYPO. CKD participants with CHr levels >28pg were 82% less likely to be diagnosed as having IDA as compared to those with CHr levels ≤ 28pg) (adj odds ratio = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.09-0.37).

In CKD mice, levels of erythroferrone mRNA in BM and splenic cells were significantly decreased, and MafB protein levels in BM cells were significantly increased. These results suggest that, in BM, the decrease in TfR, which may be associated with increased MafB levels, and the decrease in erythroferrone increase hepatic hepcidin expression, which may perturb iron recycling and erythropoiesis.","2019",,"Int J Hematol",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

In clinical practice, iron deficiency is defined based on a combination of two commonly used markers, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). However, no consensus has been reached which cutoffs of these parameters should be applied to define iron deficiency. Hence, we aimed to assess prospectively which cutoffs of ferritin and TSAT performed optimally for outcomes in CKD patients.
METHODS: We meticulously analyzed 975 CKD community dwelling patients of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease prospective study based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73m

CONCLUSION: In this study, we have shown that of the traditionally used markers of iron status, reduced TSAT, especially TSAT< 10%, is most strongly associated with the risk of adverse outcomes in CKD patients irrespective of serum ferritin level, suggesting that clinicians should focus more on TSAT rather than ferritin in this patient setting.

,"30150549","Impact of Inflammation on Ferritin, Hepcidin and the Management of Iron Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease.","Ueda N","Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major problem in chronic kidney disease (CKD), causing increased mortality. Ferritin stores iron, representing iron status. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, thereby inhibiting iron absorption/efflux. Inflammation in CKD increases ferritin and hepcidin independent of iron status, which reduce iron availability. While intravenous iron therapy (IIT) is superior to oral iron therapy (OIT) in CKD patients with inflammation, OIT is as effective as IIT in those without. Inflammation reduces predictive values of ferritin and hepcidin for iron status and responsiveness to iron therapy. Upper limit of ferritin to predict iron overload is higher in CKD patients with inflammation than in those without. However, magnetic resonance imaging studies show lower cutoff levels of serum ferritin to predict iron overload in dialysis patients with apparent inflammation than upper limit of ferritin proposed by international guidelines. Compared to CKD patients with inflammation, optimal ferritin levels for IDA are lower in those without, requiring reduced iron dose and leading to decreased mortality. The management of IDA should differ between CKD patients with and without inflammation and include minimization of inflammation. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of inflammation on ferritin, hepcidin and therapeutic strategy for IDA in CKD.","2018",,"Nutrients",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify the association between iron and bone mineral metabolism.
RESULTS: The proportion of CKD Stages 1-5 were 16.2, 18.7, 37.1, 21.6 and 6.4%, respectively. Per each 10% increase in transferrin saturation (TSAT), there was a 0.013 mmol/L decrease in phosphorus [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.021 to -0.004; P = 0.003] and a 0.022 nmol/L increase in logarithmic 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Ln-25OHD) levels (95% CI 0.005-0.040; P = 0.019).

The proportion of patients with hemoglobin response to ferric citrate treatment did not significantly differ in patients with and without HF (43% vs 49%, respectively; p = 0.47); changes from baseline in hemoglobin, iron parameters, and serum phosphate were similar. Adverse events potentially related to HF were noted more frequently in patients with HF (ferric citrate, 23%; placebo, 17%) versus those without HF (ferric citrate, 12%; placebo, 11%).

Systemic inflammation associated with oxidative stress could be an important determinant of morbidity and mortality associated with CVD. We suspected that dysregulation of iron metabolism should be considered in these patients. Anemia is prevalent in CKD patients and is often treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron. In addition, iron administration sometimes causes iron overdose. Excessive iron in the cytosol and mitochondria can accelerate the formation of a highly toxic reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radicals, which damage lipids, proteins, and DNA. In this review, we propose the following four major reasons for oxidative stress in CKD patients: 1) iron is sequestered in cells by proinflammatory cytokines and hepcidin; 2) the reduction in frataxin increases ""free"" iron in mitochondria; 3) the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid, a heme precursor, has toxic effects on iron and mitochondrial metabolism; and 4) the elevated levels of the metabolic hormone, leptin, promote hepatic hepcidin production. Although an efficient therapy for preventing oxidative stress in these patients has not yet been well defined, we propose that ESAs for renal anemia may ameliorate these causes of oxidative stress. Further clinical trials are necessary to clarify the effectiveness of ESAs on oxidative stress in CKD patients.","2019",,"Free Radic Biol Med",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The kidney recycles iron back into the circulation. However, the localization of proteins relevant for physiological tubular iron handling and their potential role in CKD remain unclear. We examined associations between iron deposition, expression of iron handling proteins and tubular injury in kidney biopsies from CKD patients and healthy controls using immunohistochemistry. Iron was deposited in proximal (PT) and distal tubules (DT) in 33% of CKD biopsies, predominantly in pathologies with glomerular dysfunction, but absent in controls. In healthy kidney, PT contained proteins required for iron recycling including putative iron importers ZIP8, ZIP14, DMT1, iron storage proteins L- and H-ferritin and iron exporter ferroportin, while DT only contained ZIP8, ZIP14, and DMT1. In CKD, iron deposition associated with increased intensity of iron importers (ZIP14, ZIP8), storage proteins (L-, H-ferritin), and/or decreased ferroportin abundance. This demonstrates that tubular iron accumulation may result from increased iron uptake and/or inadequate iron export. Iron deposition associated with oxidative injury as indicated by heme oxygenase-1 abundance. In conclusion, iron deposition is relatively common in CKD, and may result from altered molecular iron handling and may contribute to renal injury.","2018",,"Sci Rep",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The anemia groups were further subdivided into two groups based on the presence or absence of iron deficiency, defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. The NGAL was measured for all the 154 patients, and the possible relationships with iron status were analyzed. 27.7% patients with TSAT < 20% presented lower hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, and higher NGAL values than those without iron deficiency. NGAL was inversely correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, serum iron, and TSAT. NGAL adequately diagnosed the status of iron deficiency among CKD patients by ROC analysis. The optimal NGAL cutoff value able to identify iron deficiency was found to be > 244.8 ng/mL, with 73.01% sensitivity and 68.29% specificity.

The two main routes for administering iron are oral and intravenous, and there have been a number of new publications relevant to both routes of administration.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent developments on the topic of iron management in CKD include the introduction of new oral iron preparations, as well as two recent meta-analyses on iron therapy in CKD (one on oral versus intravenous iron, and one on high- versus low-dose intravenous iron in haemodialysis patients). There is also increasing interest in other strategies to improve iron availability, such as intradialytic iron, hypoxia-inducible factor stabilization and antihepcidin strategies.
SUMMARY: Even despite the latest publications in this field, we are still left with serious gaps in our evidence base on how best to provide supplemental iron to CKD patients. Most of the evidence suggests that intravenous iron is superior to oral iron in increasing haemoglobin and minimizing the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, but the safety of intravenous iron remains a controversy. The PIVOTAL study will hopefully provide informative data to fill some of the gap in the evidence-base and inform best clinical practice.","2018",,"Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Iron deficiency is a major contributory cause to the development of anaemia in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , and thus , iron replacement therapy plays a critical role in the management of this condition "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

However, few studies looked at iron treatment in the non-dialysis chronic kidney disease population.
METHODS: Five hundred and eighty patients were studied (247 were diabetic persons). Patients were divided into 4 groups: non-diabetic subjects without CKD, non-diabetic ones with GFR < 60 mL/min, diabetic persons without CKD and diabetic ones with GFR < 60 mL/min). Iron deficiency was diagnosed when serum ferritin level was <100 mg/dl. It was defined as diminished iron availability when ferritin was above 100 mg/dl and serum transferrin saturation (TSAT) was <20%.
RESULTS: Anemia was more frequent in the diabetic CKD patients group (52.4%, p < 0.001). Anemia prevalence was also higher in all CKD patients as well as in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic ones. Iron deficiency was more frequent in diabetic patients. Among CKD diabetic patients the prevalence of iron deficiency was higher than in non-diabetic CKD ones. Diminished iron availability prevalence was higher in non-diabetic patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that only sex and diabetes mellitus were independently associated with iron deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Anemia was more common in diabetic CKD patients. Diabetes mellitus was independently associated with iron deficiency. Surprisingly, diminished iron availability was not more frequent in diabetic patients.

We evaluated this compound's ability to reduce hyperphosphatemia and its effect on vascular calcification in uremic rats using an adenine-based, phosphorus-rich diet for seven weeks. We used a control group to characterize the uremia. Uremic rats were divided according the treatment into chronic kidney disease, CKD-Ch-Fe(III)CL (CKD-Ch), CKD-calcium carbonate, or CKD-sevelamer groups. We measured creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus excretion fraction, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23. Vascular calcification was assessed using the aortic calcium content, and a semi-quantitative analysis was performed using Von Kossa and hematoxylin-eosin staining. At week seven, rats in the chronic kidney disease group had higher creatinine, phosphorus, phosphorus excretion fraction, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, fibroblast growth factor 23, and aortic calcium content than those in the Control group. Treatments with cross-linked chitosan iron (III) and calcium carbonate prevented phosphorus increase (20%-30% reduction). The aortic calcium content was lowered by 88% and 85% in the CKD-Ch and CKD-sevelamer groups, respectively. The prevalence of vascular changes was higher in the chronic kidney disease and CKD-calcium carbonate (62.5%) groups than in the CKD-Ch group (37.5%). In conclusion, cross-linked chitosan iron (III) had a phosphorus chelating effect similar to calcium carbonate already available for clinical use, and prevented calcium accumulation in the aorta. Impact statement Vascular calcification (VC) is a common complication due to CKD-related bone and mineral disorder (BMD) and is characterized by deposition of calcium in vessels. Effective therapies are not yet available but new phosphorus chelators can prevent complications from CV. We tested the effect of chitosan, a new phosphorus chelator, on the VC of uremic animals. It has recently been proposed that chitosan treatment may be effective in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia. However, its action on vascular calcification has not been investigated yet. In this study, we demonstrated that chitosan reduced the calcium content in the aorta, suggesting that this may be a therapeutic approach in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia by preventing CV.","2018",,"Exp Biol Med (Maywood)",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron in vivo, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This in silico whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments.

The primary outcomes were changes in serum phosphate, calcium, and anemia-related parameters. The secondary outcomes were the adverse effects of ferric citrate. Nine studies providing data on 1755 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Ferric citrate significantly reduced serum phosphate compared with placebo (mean difference, -1.39; 95% confidence interval, -2.12 to -0.66) and had a non-inferior effect compared with active treatment. Furthermore, ferric citrate significantly improved hemoglobin, transferrin saturation and ferritin. Adverse effects of constipation did not differ significantly between ferric citrate and placebo or active treatment. This review provides evidence that ferric citrate effectively alleviates hyperphosphatemia and iron deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 requiring dialysis patients. However, the included studies did not have cardiovascular complications or mortality information and could not assess whether ferric citrate affected the risk of all-cause death or cardiovascular complications in patients with chronic kidney disease. Further studies are required to assess whether the long-term use of ferric citrate can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.","2017",,"Oncotarget",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Anaemia can be caused by dietary iron deficiency, blood loss or a combination of poor iron absorption and ineffective iron mobilization in patients with chronic disease. Nephrologists caring for patients with impaired renal function understand that iron treatment is necessary to provide adequate iron for erythropoiesis during the treatment of overt anaemia. However, a less well-understood health problem is iron deficiency, which creates symptoms that overlap with those of anaemia and often occurs in concert with chronic disease. Recently, several randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the effects of treatment with intravenous iron in heart failure patients with iron deficiency who may or may not also have anaemia. Given that heart and kidney disease are often comorbid, these clinical trials may have implications for the way nephrologists view their patients with iron deficiency.

Recent reports have shown that, in this stage, phosphate binders do not decrease serum FGF23 and PTH levels. Iron deficiency promotes transcription of FGF23 and iron-supplementation for iron deficiency decreases serum FGF23 levels. We hypothesized that ferric citrate hydrate, an iron-based phosphate binder, will decrease serum FGF23 levels in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD with normophosphatemia and iron deficiency.
METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open-label interventional study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m
RESULTS: There were 17 patients in the FCH-group, 14 in the SFC-group, and 9 in the control-group. The serum ferritin levels increased in the FCH-group and SFC-group compared with baseline.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: FIND-CKD was a 1-year, randomized, multicenter trial of iron therapy in patients with ND-CKD, anemia, and iron deficiency, without erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. Patients with active infection or C-reactive protein > 20 mg/L were excluded. In this post-hoc analysis, response was defined as ≥ 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline, before initiation of alternative anemia therapy (i.e., ESA, transfusion, or intravenous iron).
RESULTS: 308 patients received oral iron (200 mg elemental iron/day). Mean (SD) Hb at baseline was 10.4 (0.7) g/dL. At week 4, Hb data were available from 292 patients without alternative anemia therapy: 63/292 (21.6%) showed a response. Among the 229 nonresponders at week 4, 48.8% showed a cumulative response on ≥ 1 occasion by week 52 (11.1%, 19.9%, 25.9%, and 28.7% had a response at weeks 8, 12, 24, and 52, respectively), and 27.9% had received alternative iron therapy by week 52.

However, an economic evaluation of ferumoxytol has not been conducted. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of treating iron deficiency anemia in adult non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with ferumoxytol as compared with oral iron, alone or in combination with erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs).
METHODS: A decision analytic model compared health outcomes and costs associated with 5-week outpatient treatment of adult non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with ferumoxytol or oral iron, each as monotherapy or in combination with ESAs in the USA. Direct costs include the following: drug acquisition and administration, adverse events, and medical management. Efficacy was determined as mean increase in hemoglobin (g/dL) from baseline over the 5-week period. Clinical inputs were derived from patient-level data from two Phase III randomized controlled trials of ferumoxytol vs. oral iron in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, and cost inputs from RED BOOK™ and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify cost drivers and assess the stability of results.
RESULTS: The 5-week treatment cost was $2,489, $5,216, $1,298, and $4,263 per patient for ferumoxytol, ferumoxytol with ESAs, oral iron, and oral iron with ESAs, respectively. The corresponding incremental costs per g/dL increase in hemoglobin, relative to ferumoxytol alone, were $398, $3,558, and $4,768 per patient. Efficacy was the main driver of cost-effectiveness for all treatments. Adverse event and medical management costs were the principal drivers of oral iron monotherapy costs, while drug acquisition substantially contributed to the overall cost for the remaining treatments.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ferumoxytol is a cost-effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients over a 5-week period compared with oral iron with or without ESAs.

,"28992067","The uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate interferes with iron metabolism by regulating hepcidin in chronic kidney disease.","Hamano H","BACKGROUND: Hepcidin secreted by hepatocytes is a key regulator of iron metabolism throughout the body. Hepcidin concentrations are increased in chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to abnormalities in iron metabolism. Levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin, are also elevated in CKD. However, the effect of IS accumulation on iron metabolism remains unclear.
METHODS: We used HepG2 cells to determine the mechanism by which IS regulates hepcidin concentrations. We also used a mouse model of adenine-induced CKD. The CKD mice were divided into two groups: one was treated using AST-120 and the other received no treatment. We examined control mice, CKD mice, CKD mice treated using AST-120 and mice treated with IS via drinking water.
RESULTS: In the in vitro experiments using HepG2 cells, IS increased hepcidin expression in a dose-dependent manner. Silencing of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) inhibited IS-induced hepcidin expression. Furthermore, IS induced oxidative stress and antioxidant drugs diminished IS-induced hepcidin expression. Adenine-induced CKD mice demonstrated an increase in hepcidin concentrations; this increase was reduced by AST-120, an oral adsorbent of the uremic toxin. CKD mice showed renal anemia, decreased plasma iron concentration, increased plasma ferritin and increased iron content in the spleen. Ferroportin was decreased in the duodenum and increased in the spleen. These changes were ameliorated by AST-120 treatment. Mice treated by direct IS administration showed hepatic hepcidin upregulation.

,"28963827","[Iron deficiency in ND-CKD: from diagnosis to treatment].","Liberti ME","In non-dialysis-chronic kidney disease (CKD), iron deficiency is a frequent nutritional disorder due to either the greater tendency to occult gastrointestinal bleeding or to the chronic inflammatory state resulting in a reduced intestinal iron reabsorption through an increased synthesis of hepcidin. These phenomenon are responsible for a negative iron balance that compromises erythropoiesis and contributes to the pathogenesis of anemia in CKD. Several laboratory tests are now available to allow an adequate diagnosis of iron deficiency. Among the new parameters, the percentage of hypochromic red cells (% HYPO) and the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) are now considered as the most specific markers for diagnosing iron-deficiency erythropoiesis. Unfortunately, their implementation in clinical practice is limited by the scarce availability. In non-dialyzed CKD , subjects intolerant or non-responsive to oral iron therapy, can be effectively treated with novel intravenous iron preparations, such as iron carboxymaltose, that allow a complete and rapid correction of iron deficient anemia. Furthermore, this iron compound is associated with lower rate of adverse effects since the carbohydrate shell (carboxymaltose) is more stable than gluconate and saccarate thus reducing the release of free iron in the bloodstream. Of note, the possibility of administering this drug at high doses and reduced frequency decreases the risk of infusion reactions. Finally, a substantial economic saving mainly dependent on a reduction in indirect costs represents a further advantage in the use of iron carboxymaltose in this population.","2017",,"G Ital Nefrol",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Available anti-hypertensive drugs, erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron supplements have resolved quite satisfactorily the goal of controlling hypertension and partially correcting anemia. Unfortunately, the treatment of hyperphosphatemia is still far from resolved. Phosphate binders have poor tolerability and/or limited efficacy, leading to the prescription of many tablets that achieve only a mild-to-moderate effect. Moreover, increased consumption of tablets is associated with increased low tolerability, thus jeopardizing patient compliance and, in turn, the efficacy of phosphate binding. Compared to calcium-free binders, the cheaper calcium salts increase the risk of hypercalcemia, calciphylaxis and vascular calcification and possibly all-cause mortality. Calcium-free phosphate binders decrease serum phosphate levels without increasing the serum calcium concentration. The higher phosphate-binding efficacy of lanthanum carbonate compared to sevelamer should be balanced against its lack of pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism and inflammation and the accumulation in bones. New iron-based phosphate binders are available. In addition to their phosphate binding capacity, they could also be useful to treat anemia. Iron citrate is seeking for such an indication because its iron absorption is significant. This could be of clinical importance, particularly in CKD patients not on dialysis, obviating the need for extra oral iron administration and possibly favoring compliance. In conclusion, the use of iron-based phosphate binders with significant iron absorption properties could represent a novel paradigm for correcting anemia and hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients.","2017",,"J Nephrol",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

As a result, the recommendations/suggestions are not uniform. There is general consensus to prescribe iron therapy to patients who are clearly iron deficient. In addition, iron therapy may increase Hb values, delay the start of ESA therapy in ESA-naïve patients and reduce ESA dose in ESA-treated patients. However, there is debate on the safety and efficacy of IV iron therapy when given in the presence of already high serum ferritin levels. In addition, not all the guidelines/position papers differentiate between non-dialysis/dialysis patients and between the presence/absence of ESA therapy.

However, one of the studies included in this meta-analysis was 6 months long and had a mean decline in hemoglobin of 0.52 g/dL associated with intravenous iron administration. Given the short duration of most of the clinical trials comparing oral with intravenous administration of iron the long-term safety of these modes of administration of supplemental iron could not be assessed. Replacement of iron by the oral route is associated with mostly minor complications such as black stools, constipation, and abdominal discomfort. In contrast, intravenous administration of iron may lead to severe adverse events such as anaphylaxis and, as a more recent randomized trial has suggested, delayed complications such as infections and cardiovascular disease. Delayed complications of repeated intravenous iron use are difficult to recognize at an individual level therefore inpatients who have had recent cardiovascular events or are infected, intravenous iron should probably be avoided. Balancing safety and efficacy would require clinical judgment because 1 size may not fit all till we have better data to support the liberal use of parenteral iron.","2017",,"Hemodial Int",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

METHODS: This study included 419 patients who had anemia. The subjects were into categorized into a pre-dialysis group (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m
RESULTS: In non-CKD group, plasma NGAL was not associated with any baseline variables including iron indices (TSAT and serum ferritin). In pre-dialysis group, univariate analysis showed plasma NGAL correlated with eGFR, CRP, TSAT, and serum ferritin. In multivariate analysis, plasma NGAL was independently associated with TSAT. However, serum ferritin lost its association with plasma NGAL. In ROC analysis for identifying iron deficiency, the plasma NGAL (best cut-off value ≤394 ng/ml) was superior to the serum ferritin (suggested cut-off value ≤500 ng/ml) in both sensitivity and specificity.

,"28372549","The Ferumoxytol for Anemia of CKD Trial (FACT)-a randomized controlled trial of repeated doses of ferumoxytol or iron sucrose in patients on hemodialysis: background and rationale.","Macdougall IC","BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting most patients on hemodialysis and imposing a substantial clinical burden. Treatment with iron supplementation increases hemoglobin levels and can reduce the severity of anemia in patients with CKD. While correcting anemia in these patients is an important therapeutic goal, there is a lack of long-term trials directly comparing intravenous iron therapies in patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis.
METHODS/DESIGN: The Ferumoxytol for Anemia of CKD Trial (FACT) is a 13-month, open-label, randomized, multicenter, international, prospective study with 2 substudies. Entry criteria for the main study include adults with IDA (defined as hemoglobin <11.5 g/dL [<115.0 g/L] and a transferrin saturation <30%), serum ferritin <800 ng/mL (<1798 pmol/L), and receiving hemodialysis for ≥3 months. Patients are randomized to receive ferumoxytol (1.02 g over 2 doses) or iron sucrose (1.0 g over 10 doses) during the initial 5-week treatment period. Those with persistent/recurrent IDA over the 11-month observation period will receive additional 5-week treatment periods, as appropriate. The primary efficacy endpoint of the main study is the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 for each treatment period. The secondary efficacy endpoints include the mean change in transferrin saturation from Baseline to Week 5 and the proportion of patients with a hemoglobin increase of ≥1.0 g/dL at any time from Baseline to Week 5. Safety will be assessed through an examination of the adverse event profile over the course of the study. An ""oxidative stress"" substudy in approximately 100 patients will assess the effects of treatment on biomarkers of oxidative stress/inflammation during the initial 5-week treatment period, and a magnetic resonance imaging substudy in approximately 70 patients will assess the potential for iron deposition in target tissues over 24 months.
DISCUSSION: FACT fulfills the need for a long-term comparative trial in patients with IDA and CKD receiving hemodialysis. The efficacy and safety results will provide useful information for guiding therapy in this population. Two hundred ninety-six patients have been enrolled, and completion of the main study is expected soon.

METHODS: FIND-CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00994318) was a 1-year, open-label, multicenter, prospective study of patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD, anemia and iron deficiency randomized (1:1:2) to IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting higher (400-600 µg/L) or lower (100-200 µg/L) ferritin, or oral iron. A post hoc analysis of adverse event rates per 100 patient-years was performed to assess the safety of FCM versus oral iron over an extended period.
RESULTS: The safety population included 616 patients. The incidence of one or more adverse events was 91.0, 100.0 and 105.0 per 100 patient-years in the high ferritin FCM, low ferritin FCM and oral iron groups, respectively. The incidence of adverse events with a suspected relation to study drug was 15.9, 17.8 and 36.7 per 100 patient-years in the three groups; for serious adverse events, the incidence was 28.2, 27.9 and 24.3 per 100 patient-years. The incidence of cardiac disorders and infections was similar between groups. At least one ferritin level ≥800 µg/L occurred in 26.6% of high ferritin FCM patients, with no associated increase in adverse events. No patient with ferritin ≥800 µg/L discontinued the study drug due to adverse events. Estimated glomerular filtration rate remained the stable in all groups.

,"28328097","Markers of iron status in chronic kidney disease.","Gaweda AE","Anemia is one of the main comorbidities related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Until the advent of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA), endogenous erythropoietin deficiency has been thought to be the main culprit of anemia in CKD patients. The use of ESAs has shed new light on the physiology of CKD anemia, where iron homeostasis plays an increasingly important role. Disorders of iron homeostasis occurring in CKD turn the anemia management in those patients into a complex multifactorial therapeutic task, where ESA and Iron dose must be properly balanced to achieve the desired outcome without exposing the patients to the risk of serious adverse events. This review covers diagnostic markers traditionally used for quantifying iron status in CKD patients, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, new ones, such as reticulocyte hemoglobin content and percent hypochromic red cells (HRC), as well as experimental ones, such as hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). Each marker is presented in terms of their diagnostic performance, followed by biological and analytical variability data. Advantages and disadvantages of each marker are briefly discussed. Although serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are easily available, they exhibit large biological variability and require caution when used for diagnosing iron status in CKD patients. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content and the percentage of HRC are more powerful, but their widespread use is hampered by the issue of sample stability in storage. sTfR and hepcidin show promise, but require further investigation as well as the development of standardized, low-cost assay platforms.","2017",,"Hemodial Int",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"28328083","Oral iron supplementation: Potential implications for the gut microbiome and metabolome in patients with CKD.","Kortman GAM","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and loss of kidney function are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. The risks of CKD are attributed to ""uremia,"" an increased concentration of uremic retention solutes (toxins) in the plasma. Recently, a colo-renal axis became clearly apparent and uremia has been associated with an altered gut microbiome composition and metabolism. There is a high prevalence of anemia in patients with CKD, for which patients are often treated with oral or intravenous iron. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have reported adverse effects of oral iron supplementation on the gut microbiota composition, gut metabolome, and intestinal health, which in turn may result in an increased production of uremic toxins. It may also affect circulating levels of other microbe-derived molecules, that can act as mediators of immune regulation. Changes in body iron levels have also been reported to exert subtle effects on host immune function by modulating immune cell proliferation and differentiation, and by directly regulating cytokine formation and antimicrobial immune effector mechanisms. Based on the foregoing it is conceivable that oral iron supplementation in iron deficient predialysis CKD patients adversely changes gut microbiota composition, the gut and systemic metabolome, and host immunity and infection. Future studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses and to assess whether, compared to IV iron supplementation, oral iron supplementation negatively impacts on morbidity of CKD, and whether these adverse effects depend on the iron bioavailability of the iron formulation to the microbiota.","2017",,"Hemodial Int",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Iron supplementation, as well as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, are widely used for treatment of renal anemia. However, excess iron causes oxidative stress via the Fenton reaction, and iron supplementation might damage remnant renal function including erythropoietin (EPO) production in CKD. EPO gene expression was suppressed in mice following direct iron treatment. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α), a positive regulator of the EPO gene, was also diminished in the kidney of mice following iron treatment. Anemia-induced increase in renal EPO and HIF-2α expression was inhibited by iron treatment. In in vitro experiments using EPO-producing HepG2 cells, iron stimulation reduced the expression of the EPO gene, as well as HIF-2α. Moreover, iron treatment augmented oxidative stress, and iron-induced reduction of EPO and HIF-2α expression was restored by tempol, an antioxidant compound. HIF-2α interaction with the Epo promoter was inhibited by iron treatment, and was restored by tempol. These findings suggested that iron supplementation reduced EPO gene expression via an oxidative stress-HIF-2α-dependent signaling pathway.","2017",,"Lab Invest",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"28196143","Iron-restricted pair-feeding affects renal damage in rats with chronic kidney disease.","Naito Y","BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that dietary iron restriction prevents the development of renal damage in a rat model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, iron deficiency is associated with appetite loss. In addition, calorie restriction is reported to prevent the development of end-stage renal pathology in CKD rats. Thus, the beneficial effect of iron restriction on renal damage may depend on calorie restriction. Here, we investigate the effect of pair-feeding iron restriction on renal damage in a rat model of CKD.
METHODS: First, to determine the amount of food intake, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly given an ad libitum normal diet or an iron-restricted diet, and the food intake was measured. Second, CKD was induced by a 5/6 nephrectomy in SD rats, and CKD rats were given either a pair-feeding normal or iron-restricted diet.
RESULTS: Food intake was reduced in the iron-restricted diet group compared to the normal diet group of SD rats for 16 weeks (mean food intake; normal diet group and iron-restricted diet group: 25 and 20 g/day, respectively). Based on the initial experiments, CKD rats received either a pair-feeding normal or iron-restricted diet (20 g/day) for 16 weeks. Importantly, pair-feeding iron restriction prevented the development of proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage in CKD rats. Interestingly, pair-feeding iron restriction attenuated renal expression of nuclear mineralocorticoid receptor in CKD rats.

While epidemiological studies tend to be affected by confounding and reverse causation, Mendelian randomization (MR) can provide unconfounded estimates of causal effects by using genes as instruments.
METHODS: We performed an MR study of the effect of serum iron levels on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using genetic variants known to be associated with iron. MR estimates of the effect of iron on eGFR were derived based on the association of each variant with iron and eGFR from two large genome-wide meta-analyses on 48 978 and 74 354 individuals. We performed a similar MR analysis for ferritin, which measures iron stored in the body, using variants associated with ferritin.
RESULTS: A combined MR estimate across all variants showed a 1.3% increase in eGFR per standard deviation increase in iron (95% confidence interval 0.4–2.1%; P = 0.004). The results for ferritin were consistent with those for iron. Secondary MR analyses of the effects of iron and ferritin on CKD did not show significant associations but had very low statistical power.

ANIMALS: A total of 18 healthy control cats and 38 cats with CKD.
METHODS: Prospective study. After complete physical examination and routine blood analysis, the following tests were performed: serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (HAP), EPO, serum iron and ferritin concentration as well as total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Serum hepcidin-25 concentration was measured by ELISA kit designed for use in humans.
RESULTS: Mean SAA and hepcidin concentrations were significantly higher and mean total iron and TIBC were significantly lower in the CKD group (P < .05). There was a significant positive correlation between serum creatinine concentration (CRT) and 2 of the APPs (SAA and hepcidin; P < .05).

We investigated substance-specific effects of iron sucrose (IS), sodium ferric gluconate (SFG), ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and iron isomaltoside 1000 (IIM) on monocytic differentiation to M1/M2 macrophages and mDCs.
METHODS: Via flow cytometry and microRNA (miRNA) expression analysis, we morphologically and functionally characterized monocyte differentiation to M1/M2 macrophages and mDCs after monocyte stimulation with IS, SFG, FCM and IIM (0.133, 0.266 and 0.533 mg/mL, respectively). To assess potential clinical implications, we compared monocytic phagocytosis capacity in dialysis patients who received either 500 mg IS or IIM.
RESULTS: Phenotypically, IS and SFG dysregulated the expression of macrophage (e.g. CD40, CD163) and mDC (e.g. CD1c, CD141) surface markers. Functionally, IS and SFG impaired macrophage phagocytosis capacity. Phenotypic and functional alterations were less pronounced with FCM, and virtually absent with IIM. In miRNA expression analysis of mDCs, IS dysregulated miRNAs such as miR-146b-5p and miR-155-5p, which are linked to Toll-like receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed until October 2015 of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference lists of included trials.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 or 5D.
SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: All randomized controlled trials, regardless of publication status or language.
INTERVENTION: IV versus oral iron supplementation.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was defined as percentage of patients reaching an elevation in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration > 1g/dL. Secondary end points included percentage of patients who reached Hb levels > 11g/dL, absolute Hb concentration, change in Hb concentration, transferrin saturation, ferritin levels, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and blood transfusion requirement, and quality of life. Safety analysis included all-cause mortality and serious and all adverse events.
RESULTS: 24 trials were identified, 13 including 2,369 patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 and 11 including 818 patients with CKD stage 5D. Patients treated with IV iron were more likely to reach an Hb response > 1g/dL (risk ratios [RRs] of 1.61 [95% CI, 1.39-1.87] for CKD stages 3-5 and 2.14 [95% CI, 1.68-2.72] for CKD stage 5D). Safety analysis showed similar rates of mortality and serious and any adverse effects. IV iron replacement was associated with higher risk for hypotension (RR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.74-7.94) and fewer gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28-0.67).
LIMITATIONS: Significant heterogeneity between trials; follow-up was usually limited to 3 months.

Treatment with oral iron is often inadequate and international guidelines recommend intravenous (i.v.) iron as the preferred option for the treatment of IDA in certain clinical situations. In this review, we assess the safety of using i.v. iron with a particular focus on patients with chronic kidney disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent publications have raised safety concerns regarding the incidence of serious reactions accompanying i.v. infusion, as well as the subsequent risk of infections and cardiovascular events. Methodological flaws influence the interpretation of these data that lack evidence from the use of modern irons. The latter have been investigated in several randomized control trials.
SUMMARY: There is a need for better understanding and definition of the nature of i.v. iron reactions, as many are nonserious infusion reactions rather than true anaphylaxis. Retrospective identification of anaphylaxis is difficult and we suggest the importance of reanalysing data using fatalities or standardized terms as outcome measures. With the exception of high molecular weight iron dextran, serious or life-threatening reactions are rare with the use of i.v. irons, and they can be used safely for the treatment of IDA.","2016",,"Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) is common and associated with fatigue , reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcomes "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The discovery of hepcidin and its functions has contributed to a better understanding of iron metabolism disorders in CKD anemia. Hepcidin is a peptide mainly produced by hepatocytes and, through a connection with ferroportin, it regulates iron absorption in the duodenum and its release of stock cells. High hepcidin concentrations described in patients with CKD, especially in more advanced stages are attributed to decreased renal excretion and increased production. The elevation of hepcidin has been associated with infection, inflammation, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and oxidative stress. Some strategies were tested to reduce the effects of hepcidin in patients with CKD, however more studies are necessary to assess the impact of its modulation in the management of anemia in this population.

Our objective was to determine how chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dietary iron intake affect FGF23 production and metabolism in wild-type (WT) and hepcidin knockout (HKO) mice. For 8 wk, the mice were fed diets that contained adenine (to induce CKD) or no adenine (control group), with either low-iron (4 ppm) or standard-iron (335 ppm) concentrations. The low-iron diet induced iron deficiency anemia in both the WT and HKO mice. Among the WT mice, in both the control and CKD groups, a low-iron compared with a standard-iron diet increased bone Fgf23 mRNA expression, C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) levels, and FGF23 cleavage as manifested by a lower percentage intact FGF23 (iFGF23). Independent of iron status, CKD was associated with inhibition of FGF23 cleavage. Similar results were observed in the HKO control and CKD groups.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing sevelamer or lanthanum with other phosphate binders in CKD.
RESULTS: Fifty-one trials (8829 patients) were reviewed. Compared with calcium-based binders, all-cause mortality was nonsignificantly lower with sevelamer {risk ratio [RR] 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-1.08]} and lanthanum [RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.18-3.00)], but risk of bias was concerning. Compared with calcium-based binders, sevelamer reduced the risk of hypercalcemia [RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.17-0.42)], as did lanthanum [RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.05-0.32)]. Sevelamer reduced hospitalizations [RR 0.50 (95% CI 0.31-0.81)], but not lanthanum [RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.34-1.93)]. The presence/absence of other clinically relevant outcomes was infrequently reported.

There are few trials directly comparing the safety and efficacy of different intravenous iron products.
METHODS: This post-hoc analysis pooled data from 767 patients enrolled in two randomized, controlled, open-label trials of similar design comparing the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with ferumoxytol and iron sucrose across patients with all stages of renal function. One trial was conducted in adults with CKD either on or not on dialysis and the second in adults with IDA of any underlying cause and a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used who had normal to no worse than moderately impaired renal function. Patients were categorized by chronic kidney disease stage (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of adverse events was numerically lower in ferumoxytol-treated patients compared to those treated with iron sucrose (42.4 vs. 50.2 %, respectively); the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was generally similar between the two treatment groups (13.6 vs. 16.0 %, respectively). Adverse events of Special Interest (i.e., hypotension, hypersensitivity) occurred at lower rates in those treated with ferumoxytol compared to those treated with iron sucrose (2.5 vs. 5.3 %, respectively). Overall, mean hemoglobin increased in both treatment groups, regardless of degree of renal insufficiency, although greater increases were seen among those with less severe kidney damage. Mean increases in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 were significantly greater with ferumoxytol than with iron sucrose treatment in the subgroup with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90 mL/min (Least Squares mean difference = 0.53 g/dL; p < 0.001). There were no other consistent, significant differences in hemoglobin levels between treatment groups for the other chronic kidney disease categories except for isolated instances favoring ferumoxytol.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of ferumoxytol is at least comparable to iron sucrose in patients with varying degrees of renal function.

Serum hepcidin levels were measured centrally in a subset of 61 patients. Mean (SD) baseline hepcidin level was 4.0(3.5), 7.3(6.4) and 6.5(5.6) ng/mL in the high ferritin FCM (n = 17), low ferritin FCM (n = 16) and oral iron group (n = 28). The mean (SD) endpoint value (i.e. the last post-baseline value) was 26.0(9.1),15.7(7.7) and 16.3(11.0) ng/mL, respectively. The increase in hepcidin from baseline was significantly smaller with low ferritin FCM or oral iron vs high ferritin FCM at all time points up to week 52. Significant correlations were found between absolute hepcidin and ferritin values (r = 0.65, p<0.001) and between final post-baseline increases in both parameters (r = 0.70, p<0.001). The increase in hepcidin levels over the 12-month study generally mirrored the cumulative iron dose in each group. Hepcidin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) absolute values showed no correlation, although there was an association between final post-baseline increases (r = 0.42, p<0.001). Absolute values (r = 0.36, p = 0.004) and final post-baseline increases of hepcidin and hemoglobin (p = 0.30, p = 0.030) correlated weakly. Baseline hepcidin levels were not predictive of a hematopoietic response to iron therapy. In conclusion, hepcidin levels rose in response to either intravenous or oral iron therapy, but the speed and extent of the rise was greatest with intravenous iron targeting a higher ferritin level.

Iron overload can intensify the chronic kidney disease-associated oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease; increase the risk of infections; worsen the severity of type 2 diabetes; and exacerbate neurologic and cognitive dysfunction. These and other adverse effects largely are mediated by iron-catalyzed generation of reactive oxygen species.

Both absolute and functional iron-deficiency anemia have been shown to respond to intravenous (IV) iron replacement. Although parenteral iron is an efficacious method and superior to standard doses of oral iron in patients on hemodialysis, there are ongoing safety concerns about repeated exposure potentially enhancing infection risk and cardiovascular disease. Each IV iron product is composed of an iron core with a carbohydrate shell. The avidity of iron binding and the type of carbohydrate shell play roles in the safe maximal dose and the frequency and severity of acute infusion reactions. All IV iron products are taken up into the reticuloendothelial system where the shell is metabolized and the iron is stored within tissue ferritin or exported to circulating transferrin. IV iron can be given as large intermittent doses (loading therapy) or in smaller doses at frequent intervals (maintenance dosing regimen). Limited trial data and observational data suggest that a maintenance dosing regimen is more efficacious and possibly safer than loading therapy. There is no consensus regarding the preferred method of iron repletion in patients on peritoneal dialysis, although small studies comparing oral and parenteral iron regimens in these patients have shown the latter to be more efficacious.

Haemoglobin was increased more by both oral and parenteral iron compared with inactive control [mean difference (MD) 0.91 g/dL, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35; and MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57, respectively], and parenteral iron demonstrated a greater increase when compared with oral iron (MD 0.53 g/dL, 95% CI 0.31-0.75). In all comparisons, there were no differences in the results comparing patients with and without heart failure.

Iron metabolism should be considered in the pathogenesis of infectious disease, as high local iron concentrations favor the growth of many microbes. This review is intended to provide information regarding iron metabolism and infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. There are 2 reasons these patients may be vulnerable to infection: (1) the excessive iron administered to treat renal anemia could be associated with impairments of the host's innate immune response, (2) CKD-associated inflammation could cause dysregulated iron metabolism. Pathogenic microorganisms can be categorized as extracellular or intracellular pathogens. The proliferation site may determine the degree of virulence. In cases of mainly extracellular microbial growth, the host's strategy of sequestering iron in cells may efficiently inhibit proliferation. However, the same strategy may favor the intracellular growth of microorganisms. The administration of excessive amounts of iron may modify iron localization by an increase in the hepcidin concentration. We conclude that there is a need for large multicenter randomized controlled trials to evaluate the long-term safety of different iron administration patterns that allow for a lower infection rate while still producing efficient erythropoiesis in CKD patients.","2016",,"Am J Nephrol",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Whether accompanying anemia alone is responsible for this diminished PON and ARE activities in CKD patients or an additive factor for this is not well studied. Therefore, we tried to clarify this issue here.
METHODS: A total of 82 subjects that consisted of 19 patients with IDA (group 1), 23 anemic CKD patients (group 2), and 40 age and sex matched healthy subjects (group 3) were enrolled. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), serum total thiol (-SH), PON, and ARE activities of the participants were analyzed.
RESULTS: Group 2 patients had significantly lowest serum levels of Total -SH, PON and ARE. Further comparison showed that total -SH, PON and ARE levels were lower in group 1 than group 3 (p = 0.0001 in both). Regarding comparison of group 1 and 2, only serum ARE levels were significantly lower in group 2 (p = 0.001). PON activity was not different between group 1 and group 2 whereas ARE activity was lower in group 2 than groups 1 and 3. In addition, correlation analysis showed that CIMT was negatively correlated with PON and ARE.

METHODS: Serum concentrations of GDF-15, iron (Fe), transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and hemoglobin were measured in 56 patients ≥65 years of age and in 31 <65 years of age.
RESULTS: In patients ≥65 years, serum concentrations of GDF-15 and hsCRP were significantly higher in comparison with younger group. There was no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin, iron, hepcidin, and sTfR concentration between the two studied groups. In both groups GDF-15 was significantly correlated with hemoglobin, eGFR, hsCRP, and IL-6. GDF-15 was significantly higher in patients with anemia in comparison with their non-anemic counterparts. In multivariate analysis, hemoglobin was found to be a predictor of log GDF-15 (beta value = 0.36, P = 0.006, R (2) = 37 %).
CONCLUSIONS: An intricate interplay between renal function, anemia, and GDF-15 concentrations awaits further studies, as there are few data regarding pathophysiological role of GDF-15 in diabetes, kidney disease, and other comorbidities. Further understanding regarding the signaling pathways of GDF-15 may help to discover next pieces in the exciting puzzle of GDF-15.

It was found that the rHuEPO stimulus triggered a first wave to achieve correction of anemia, by inhibiting hepcidin synthesis, favoring erythropoiesis and iron absorption; this continuous stimulus enhanced iron absorption leading to iron overload, as showed by the hepatic iron deposits found in rats treated with higher rHuEPO dose that seems to trigger the upregulation of hepcidin synthesis through the activation of the BMP6/SMAD pathway. The data suggested that liver iron overload was an important stimuli for hepcidin synthesis, stronger than the inhibitory effect of high rHuEPO doses; moreover, the findings raised the hypothesis that when high inflammation (triggering hepcidin expression) was associated with increased iron stores in hemodialysis patients, hepcidin expression was also upregulated via BMP6, enhancing hepcidin synthesis, leading, therefore, to worsening of anemia and, eventually, to a hyporesponse/resistance to rHuEPO therapy. © 2016 BioFactors, 42(3):296-306, 2016.","2016",,"Biofactors"," Considering its interaction with several factors that are altered in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , particularly in hyporesponsive CKD patients under therapy with high recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEPO ) doses , it was aimed to study the impact of increasing rHuEPO doses on the regulation of iron-hepcidin metabolism ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Following concerns around ESA therapy, intravenous (IV) iron is being administered more and more worldwide. However, it is still unclear whether this approach is safe at very high doses or in the presence of very high ferritin levels. Some observational studies have shown a relationship between either high ferritin level or high iron dose and increased risk of death, cardiovascular events, hospitalization or infection. Others have not been able to confirm these findings. However, they suffer from indication biases. On the other hand, the majority of randomized clinical trials have only a very short follow-up (and thus drug exposure) and are inadequate to assess the mortality risk. None of them have tested the role of different iron doses on hard end points. With the lack of clear evidence coming from well-designed and large-scale studies, several data suggest that excessive iron therapy may be toxic in several aspects, ranging from iron overload to tissue damage from labile iron. A number of experimental and clinical data suggest that either excessive iron therapy or iron overload may be a possible culprit of atherogenesis. The process seems to be mediated by oxidative stress. Iron therapy should also be used cautiously in the presence of active infections, since iron is essential for bacterial growth. Recently, the European Medicines Agency officially raised concerns about rare hypersensitivity reactions following IV iron administration. The balance has been in favour of benefits. In several European countries, this has created a lot of confusion and somewhat slowed the run towards excessive use. Altogether, IV iron remains a mainstay of anaemia treatment in CKD patients. However, in our opinion, its excessive use should be avoided, especially in patients with high ferritin levels and when ESA agents are not contraindicated.","2016",,"Clin Kidney J",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

It is characterized by abnormalities in mineral and bone metabolism with resulting hyperphosphatemia, low serum vitamin D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, altered bone morphology and strength, higher risk of bone fractures, and development of vascular or other soft tissue calcifications. Besides the recommendation to reduce phosphorus dietary intake, many drugs are currently available for the treatment of calcium/phosphate imbalance. Among them, phosphate binders represent a milestone. Calcium-based binders (calcium carbonate, calcium acetate) are effective in lowering serum phosphate, but their use has been associated with an increased risk of hypercalcemia and calcifications. Calcium-free binders (sevelamer hydrochloride, sevelamer carbonate, and lanthanum carbonate) are equally or slightly less effective than calcium-containing compounds. They would not induce an increase in calcium levels but may have relevant side effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms for sevelamer and risk of tissue accumulation for lanthanum. Accordingly, new phosphate binders are under investigation and some of them have already been approved. A promising option is sucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro(®), PA21), an iron-based phosphate binder consisting of a mixture of polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose, and starches. The present review is focused on pharmacology, mode of action, and pharmacokinetics of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, with a discussion on comparative efficacy, safety, and tolerability studies of this drug in chronic kidney disease and patient perspectives such as quality of life, satisfaction, and acceptability. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide has proven to be as effective as sevelamer in reducing phosphatemia with a similar safety profile and lower pill burden. Experimental and clinical studies have documented a minimal percentage of iron absorption without inducing toxicity. In conclusion, the overall benefit-risk balance of sucroferric oxyhydroxide is deemed to be positive, and this new drug may therefore represent a good alternative to traditional phosphate binders for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients.","2016",,"Int J Nephrol Renovasc Dis",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Here, we evaluated whether epoetin beta pegol (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator: CERA), which has a long half-life in blood and strongly suppresses hepcidin-25, exerts renoprotection in a rat model of chronic progressive glomerulonephritis (cGN). cGN rats showed elevated urinary total protein excretion (uTP) and plasma urea nitrogen (UN) from day 14 after the induction of kidney disease (day 0) and finally declined into end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), showing reduced creatinine clearance with glomerulosclerosis, tubular dilation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. A single dose of CERA given on day 1, but not on day 16, alleviated increasing uTP and UN, thereby delaying ESKD. In the initial disease phase, CERA significantly suppressed urinary 8-OHdG and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a tubular damage marker. CERA also inhibited elevated plasma hepcidin-25 levels and alleviated subsequent iron accumulation in kidneys in association with elevated urinary iron excretion and resulted in alleviation of growth of Ki67-positive tubular and glomerular cells. In addition, at day 28 when the exacerbation of uTP occurs, a significant correlation was observed between iron deposition in the kidney and urinary L-FABP. In our study, CERA mitigated increasing kidney damage, thereby delaying CKD progression in this glomerulonephritis rat model.

Here we tested whether inflammation and iron deficiency regulate FGF23. In wild-type mice, acute inflammation induced by single injections of heat-killed Brucella abortus or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) decreased serum iron within 6 h, and was accompanied by significant increases in osseous Fgf23 mRNA expression and serum levels of C-terminal FGF23, but no changes in intact FGF23. Chronic inflammation induced by repeated bacteria or IL-1β injections decreased serum iron, increased osseous Fgf23 mRNA, and serum C-terminal FGF23, but modestly increased biologically active, intact FGF23 serum levels. Chronic iron deficiency mimicked chronic inflammation. Increased osseous FGF23 cleavage rather than a prolonged half-life of C-terminal FGF23 fragments accounted for the elevated C-terminal FGF23 but near-normal intact FGF23 levels in inflammation. IL-1β injection increased Fgf23 mRNA and C-terminal FGF23 levels similarly in wildtype and Col4a3(ko) mice with CKD but markedly increased intact FGF23 levels only in the CKD mice. Inflammation increased Fgf23 transcription by activating Hif1α signaling. Thus, inflammation and iron deficiency stimulate FGF23 production.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort design.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Clinical data (2008-2010) from a large dialysis organization merged with data from the US Renal Data System. 13,039 patients receiving center-based hemodialysis were included.
PREDICTOR: Iron and ESA dosing were assessed during 1-month (n=14,901) and 2-week (n=15,296) exposure periods.
OUTCOMES: HRQoL was measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) instrument (0-100 scale) during a 3-month follow-up period.
MEASUREMENTS: Generalized linear mixed models, adjusting for several covariates, were used to estimate associations between iron and ESA dosing and HRQoL overall and for clinically relevant subgroups.
RESULTS: For the 1-month exposure period, patients with lower baseline hemoglobin levels who received higher ESA dosing had higher physical health and kidney disease symptom scores (by 2.4 [95% CI, 0.6-4.2] and 5.6 [95% CI, 2.8-8.4] points, respectively) in follow-up than patients who received lower ESA dosing.

Oral supplementation, in particular with ferrous salts, is associated with a high rate of gastro-intestinal side effects and is poorly absorbed, a problem that is avoided with intravenous (IV) irons. Recently, with the approval of the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the French Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) took adequate measures to minimize the risk of allergic reactions, by correction on the summary of intravenous iron products characteristics. All IV iron products should be prescribed, administered and injected, inside public or private hospitals exclusively, and a clinical follow-up after the infusion for at least 30 minutes is mandatory. The most stable intravenous iron complexes (low molecular weight iron dextran, ferric carboxymaltose, and iron isomaltoside 1000 [under agreement]) can be given in higher single doses and more rapidly than less recent preparations such as iron sucrose (originator or similars). Test doses are advisable for conventional low molecular weight iron dextrans, but are no more mandatory. Iron supplementation is recommended for all CKD patients with iron-deficiency anaemia and those who receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, whether or not they require dialysis. Intravenous iron is the preferred route of administration in haemodialysis patients, with randomized trials showing a significantly greater increase in haemoglobin levels for intravenous versus oral iron and a low rate of treatment-related adverse events during these trials. According ANSM, physicians should apply the product's label recommendations especially the posology. In the non-dialysis CKD population, the erythropoietic response is also significantly higher using intravenous versus oral iron, and tolerability is at least as good. Moreover in some non-dialysis patients, intravenous iron supplementation might avoid or at least delay the need for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Following the new ANSM's recommendations, we now have the ability to achieve iron stores replenishment correctly and conveniently in dialysis dependent and non-dialysis dependent CKD patients without compromising safety using the various pharmaceutical forms of iron products especially intravenous compounds.","2015",,"Nephrol Ther",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding and outcome measurement error.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the 2 iron formulations studied exhibited similar safety profiles; however, ferric gluconate was associated with a slightly decreased risk for infection-related outcomes compared to iron sucrose among patients with a hemodialysis catheter. These associations should be explored further using other data or study designs.","2016",,"Am J Kidney Dis"," Despite different pharmacologic properties , little is known about the comparative safety of sodium ferric gluconate versus iron sucrose in hemodialysis patients ","comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"26381391","How to Supplement Iron in Patients with Renal Anemia.","Tanaka S","Iron deficiency is a major cause of hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and is often observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with anemia. With iron supplementation, ESA doses can be decreased, resulting in lower treatment costs and possibly lower cardiovascular risks that are associated with high-dose ESA therapy. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guideline specified ferritin ≤ 500 ng/ml and transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤ 30% as thresholds of iron parameters for CKD patients. However, long-term safety (in terms of mortality, cardiovascular/infection risk and tissue deposition) of high-dose intravenous iron supplementation with such high target levels of ferritin/TSAT has not been confirmed. Recently, there has been increase in the use of intravenous iron and average ferritin levels in dialysis patients in the United States. Clinical trials conducted so far have been underpowered to conclusively establish the long-term safety of intravenous iron supplementation. Results from observational studies are conflicting, and many experimental studies have even shown negative effects of intravenous iron. Clearly, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed, studying various doses of intravenous iron, with sufficient patient numbers and longer observation periods, to investigate mortality, cardiovascular effects and infection risks of this treatment. Until the long-term safety of iron supplementation at high doses is established, a more prudent decision on iron supplementation with lower target levels of ferritin/TSAT seems reasonable, in light of the decades of experience with ESA that has shown that definitive clinical outcomes have been dissociated from surrogate outcomes (especially hemoglobin concentration).","2015",,"Nephron"," Clearly , randomized clinical trials are urgently needed , studying various doses of intravenous iron , with sufficient patient numbers and longer observation periods , to investigate mortality , cardiovascular effects and infection risks of this treatment "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Treating anaemia with erythropoietic growth factors produces no improvement. In recent years, the focus has therefore shifted to correction of iron deficiency. Chronic inflammation in CKD increases the production of hepcidin, which blocks iron absorption from the intestine and leads to less efficient re-use of iron from the macrophages. In absolute iron deficiency the body's iron stores are depleted, whereas in functional iron deficiency the supply of iron is not sufficient to meet demand from the bone marrow. Normal or high ferritin levels do not exclude iron deficiency at tissue level. The iron saturation fraction is a more useful indicator. Parenteral iron therapy ameliorates in CHF the symptoms of iron deficiency, irrespective of the effect on haemoglobin levels.

In hemodialysis (HD) patients this condition may be aggravated by iron deficiency (absolute or functional). The correction of this anemia is usually achieved by treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron (oral or intravenous). Studies questioning the safety of ESAs (especially at higher doses) changed the pattern of anemia treatment in CKD patients. According to the new guidelines, when transferrin saturation is lower than 30% and ferritin lower than 500 ng/mL, a trial with iron should be started, to avoid therapy with ESAs or at least to reduce the doses needed to treat the anemia. Recent reports showed increasing ferritin levels, towards values above 800 ng/mL, in CKD patients treated according to the guidelines. In this review we focus on the risks of the increased iron use to treat CKD anemia, namely, iron overload and toxicity, increased risk of infections, as well as mortality.","2016",,"Blood Rev",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"26268514","Effects of carnitine on oxidative stress response to intravenous iron administration to patients with CKD: impact of haptoglobin phenotype.","Armaly Z","BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common disorder in CKD patients. It is largely attributed to decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production and iron deficiency. Therefore, besides EPO, therapy includes iron replenishment. However, the latter induces oxidative stress. Haptoglobin (Hp) protein is the main line of defense against the oxidative effects of Hemoglobin/Iron. There are 3 genotypes: 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2. Hp 2-2 protein is inferior to Hp 1-1 as antioxidant. So far, there is no evidence whether haptoglobin phenotype affects iron-induced oxidative stress in CKD patients. Therefore, the present study examines the influence of carnitine treatment on the intravenous iron administration (IVIR)-induced oxidative stress in CKD patients, and whether Hp phenotype affects this response.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN5700858. This study included 26 anemic (Hb = 10.23 ± 0.28) CKD patients (stages 3-4) that were given a weekly IVIR (Sodium ferric gluconate, [125 mg/100 ml] for 8 weeks, and during weeks 5-8 also received Carnitine (20 mg/kg, IV) prior to IVIR. Weekly blood samples were drawn before and after each IVIR for Hp phenotype, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), besides complete blood count and biochemical analyses.
RESULTS: Eight percent of CKD patients were Hp1-1, 19 % Hp2-1, and 73 % Hp2-2. IVIR for 4 weeks did not increase hemoglobin levels, yet worsened the oxidative burden as was evident by elevated plasma levels of AOPP. The highest increase in AOPP was observed in Hp2-2 patients. Simultaneous administration of Carnitine with IVIR abolished the IVIR-induced oxidative stress as evident by preventing the elevations in AOPP and NGAL, preferentially in patients with Hp2-2 phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Hp2-2 is a significant risk factor for IVIR-induced oxidative stress in CKD patients. Our finding, that co-administration of Carnitine with IVIR preferentially attenuates the adverse consequences of IVIR, suggests a role for Carnitine therapy in these patients.","2015",,"BMC Nephrol",,"clinical trial",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

This trial compared the efficacy and safety of IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) and oral iron in NDD-CKD patients with renal-related anaemia.
METHODS: The trial was a Phase III open-label, comparative, multicentre, non-inferiority trial conducted in 351 iron-deficient NDD-CKD patients, randomized 2:1 to either iron isomaltoside 1000 (Group A) or iron sulphate administered as 100 mg elemental oral iron twice daily (200 mg daily) for 8 weeks (Group B). The patients in Group A were randomized into A1 (infusion of max. 1000 mg single doses over 15 min) and A2 (bolus injections of 500 mg over 2 min). A modified Ganzoni formula was used to calculate IV iron need. The primary end point was change in haemoglobin concentrations from baseline to Week 4.
RESULTS: Iron isomaltoside 1000 was both non-inferior to oral iron at Week 4 (P < 0.001) and sustained a superior increase in haemoglobin from Week 3 until the end of the study at Week 8 (P = 0.009 at Week 3). The haemoglobin response was more pronounced with iron isomaltoside 1000 doses ≥1000 mg (P < 0.05). Serum-ferritin and transferrin saturation concentrations were also significantly increased with IV iron. Adverse drug reactions were observed in 10.5% in the iron isomaltoside 1000 group and 10.3% in the oral iron group.

We here evaluate whether these changes are followed by subsequent modifications in physicians' anaemia management in Sweden.
METHODS: We included patients incident to the Swedish Renal Registry for CKD non-dialysis (CKD-ND, referred patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and haemodialysis (HD) between 2008 and 2013. Time trends in anaemia management were investigated in relation to prescribed medication, laboratory measures and other relevant clinical characteristics. Linear and binominal regression models were used to describe trends across three predefined time periods (2008-09, 2010-11 and 2012-13).
RESULTS: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) use decreased over time among both CKD-ND and HD patients [risk ratio (RR) 2012-13 compared with 2008-09 for CKD-ND 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96; RR for HD 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.97]. Mean ESA dose decreased significantly among HD patients (7% in 2010-11 compared with 2008-09 and another 3% during 2012-13). Over the time periods studied, ESA doses increased slightly in the CKD-ND population. Mean haemoglobin (Hb) levels decreased in CKD-ND patients, among both ESA users and non-users, whereas it decreased to a lesser degree, albeit significantly, among HD ESA users. The risk of having an Hb >120 g/L decreased, especially between 2008-09 and 2010-11. Iron use increased over time, mainly in the HD population, but also among CKD-ND ESA non-users.

The main pathomechanism responsible for ACD is subclinical inflammation. The key element involved in iron metabolism is hepcidin, however, studies on new indices of iron status are in progress.The aim of the study was to assess the iron status in patients in early stages of chronic kidney disease, iron correlation with inflammation parameters and novel biomarkers of iron metabolism.
METHODS: The study included 69 patients. Standard laboratory measurements were used to measure the iron status, complete blood count, fibrinogen, prothrombin index, C-reactive protein concentration (CRP), creatinine, urea, uric acid. Commercially available kits were used to measure high-sensitivity CRP, interleukin 6 (IL-6), hepcidin-25, hemojuvelin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and zonulin.
RESULTS: Absolute iron deficiency was present in 17% of the patients, functional iron deficiency was present in 12% of the patients. Functional iron deficiency was associated with significantly higher serum levels of fibrinogen, ferritin, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, hepcidin and older age relative to patients with absolute iron deficiency. In comparison with patients without iron deficiency, patients with functional iron deficiency were older, with lower prothrombin index, higher fibrinogen, CRP, hsCRP, sTfR, GDF-15, urea and lower eGFR. Hepcidin was predicted by markers of inflammation:ferritin, fibrinogen and IL-6.

Possible healthcare cost savings, which have not been demonstrated in a long-term study, may be an additional advantage of using such multi-pronged treatment strategies for the control of both hyperphosphatemia and iron needs. It is currently assumed that oral iron supplementation is less efficient than the IV route in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The unexpected efficacy of novel iron-containing phosphate binders, such as ferric citrate, in repleting insufficient iron stores and improving the anemia of CKD could change this view. Previous assumptions of self-controlled iron uptake by 'mucosal block' or hepcidin, or else by impaired intestinal iron absorption due to CKD-associated inflammation cannot be reconciled with recent observations of the effects of ferric citrate administration. Citrate in the intestinal lumen may partly contribute to the acceleration of iron absorption. Animal experiments and clinical studies have also shown that oral iron overload can cause excessive iron accumulation despite high hepcidin levels, which are not able to block iron absorption completely. However, like with IV iron agents, no long-term safety data exist with respect to the effects of iron-containing phosphate binders on 'hard' patient outcomes. Future randomized prospective studies in patients with CKD are necessary to establish the safety of oral iron-containing phosphate binders for the control of both hyperphosphatemia and renal anemia.","2016",,"Nephrol Dial Transplant",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

There remains a concern for its use in patients with asthma as it may trigger an acute exacerbation. Pre-treatment with a single dose of parenteral hydrocortisone may obviate this risk.
METHOD: We carried out a prospective study of known asthmatic patients with CKD requiring single-dose iron repletion therapy. We analysed the efficacy and safety of IV CosmoFer (low molecular weight iron dextran). Twenty non-dialysis CKD patients with iron deficiency anaemia and a history of asthma were enrolled. Severity of asthma and level of control were recorded as per British Thoracic Society Guidelines and Royal Collage of Physician questionnaire, respectively. All patients received IV hydrocortisone 30 min before the test dose of CosmoFer followed by the remaining total dose. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions. Haemoglobin, serum ferritin levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were measured pre and 6-weeks post-infusion. All patients were followed up until 6 weeks to assess the control of their asthma.
RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the study. No patient experienced acute hypersensitivity or infusion reactions. At 6 weeks follow-up, no patient reported worsening of their asthma. There was an increase in mean haemoglobin from 10.1 to 11.1 g/dl and mean ferritin from 93.5 to 302.6 ng/ml.

Iron deficiency is an important contributing factor, and adequate iron supplementation is essential to optimize the management of anaemia of CKD. Oral iron is convenient and inexpensive but is poorly absorbed and associated with gastrointestinal distress. Intravenous iron overcomes these limitations but is more expensive, requires additional clinical visits for administration and is associated with serious adverse events. Oral heme iron polypeptide (HIP) is a newer dosage form that has been reported to have higher bioavailability and fewer side effects when compared with non-heme iron in healthy subjects, but data in patients with CKD are limited. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of HIP for the management of CKD.
METHODS: Searches for PubMed (1947-2015) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-2015) were conducted using the following terms: heme iron, heme iron polypeptide, oral iron, anaemia and chronic kidney disease. The bibliography of each relevant article was evaluated for additional studies. Articles were selected for review if they were published in the English language and were randomized controlled trials evaluating the bioavailability, tolerability or efficacy of oral HIP in human subjects with CKD.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This search yielded three clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of HIP was evaluated in a total of 161 subjects with anaemia and various stages of CKD. HIP was consistently associated with lower ferritin values when compared with traditional iron supplementation. With few exceptions, the effect of HIP on haemoglobin, haematocrit, transferrin saturation and recombinant human erythropoietin dose, and adverse effects appeared similar to intravenous and oral non-heme iron supplementation. The cost of HIP is substantially more than non-heme iron and comparable to intravenous iron.

This study evaluated whether a switch from oral iron to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose can reduce ESA requirements and improve iron status and hemoglobin in patients with ND-CKD.
METHODS: This prospective, single arm and single-center study included adult patients with ND-CKD (creatinine clearance ≤40 mL/min), hemoglobin 11-12 g/dL and iron deficiency (ferritin <100 μg/L or transferrin saturation <20%), who were regularly treated with oral iron and ESA during 6 months prior to inclusion. Study patients received an intravenous ferric carboxymaltose dose of 1,000 mg iron, followed by a 6-months ESA/ ferric carboxymaltose maintenance regimen (target: hemoglobin 12 g/dL, transferrin saturation >20%). Outcome measures were ESA dose requirements during the observation period after initial ferric carboxymaltose treatment (primary endpoint); number of hospitalizations and transfusions, renal function before and after ferric carboxymaltose administration, number of adverse reactions (secondary endpoints). Hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured monthly from baseline until end of study. Creatinine clearance, proteinuria, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase bimonthly from baseline until end of study.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled (age 70.1±11.4 years; mean±SD). Mean ESA consumption was significantly reduced by 83.2±10.9% (from 41,839±3,668 IU/patient to 6,879±4,271 IU/patient; p<0.01). Hemoglobin increased by 0.7±0.3 g/dL, ferritin by 196.0±38.7 μg/L and transferrin saturation by 5.3±2.9% (month 6 vs. baseline; all p<0.01). No ferric carboxymaltose-related adverse events were reported and no patient withdrew or required transfusions during the study.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with ND-CKD and stable normal or borderline hemoglobin, switching from oral iron to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose was associated with significant improvements in hematological and iron parameters and a significant reduction in ESA dose requirements in this single-center pilot study.

It is mainly due to a reduced production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the kidneys; however, there are evidences that iron metabolism disturbances increase as CKD progresses. Our aim was to study the mechanisms underlying the development of anemia of CKD, as well as renal damage, in the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. This model of CKD presented a sustained degree of renal dysfunction, with mild and advanced glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions. Anemia developed 3 weeks after nephrectomy and persisted throughout the protocol. The remnant kidney was still able to produce EPO and the liver showed an increased EPO gene expression. In spite of the increased EPO blood levels, anemia persisted and was linked to low serum iron and transferrin levels, while serum interleukin (IL)-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels showed the absence of systemic inflammation. The increased expression of duodenal ferroportin favours iron absorption; however, serum iron is reduced which might be due to iron leakage through advanced kidney lesions, as showed by tubular iron accumulation. Our data suggest that the persistence of anemia may result from disturbances in iron metabolism and by an altered activity/function of EPO as a result of kidney cell damage and a local inflammatory milieu, as showed by the increased gene expression of different inflammatory proteins in the remnant kidney. In addition, this anemia and the associated kidney hypoxia favour the development of fibrosis, angiogenesis and inflammation that may underlie a resistance to EPO stimuli and reduced iron availability. These findings might contribute to open new windows to identify putative therapeutic targets for this condition, as well as for recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) resistance, which occurs in a considerable percentage of CKD patients.","2015",,"PLoS One"," Our aim was to study the mechanisms underlying the development of anemia of CKD , as well as renal damage , in the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5 / 6 nephrectomy ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Patient follow-up took place until dialysis, death before initiation of dialysis or 31 December 2009. The primary outcomes were death before initiating dialysis, hospitalization before death or long-term dialysis.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the patients who received iron supplementation were associated with a lower risk of all-cause death [hazard ratio (HR), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-0.90] compared with non-users. The survival benefit of iron use was consistent across the majority of dosage groups, except for those who were treated with monthly IV iron >200 mg. Moreover, compared with the non-users, the iron users were associated with a lower risk of hospitalizations (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99) but with a higher risk of faster progression to end-stage renal disease (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08).

,"25815172","Iron-based phosphate binders: do they offer advantages over currently available phosphate binders?","Negri AL","Increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been associated with the hyperphosphatemia seen in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral phosphate binders are prescribed in these patients to prevent intestinal absorption of dietary phosphate and reduce serum phosphate. In prospective observational cohorts they have shown to decrease all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk. Different problems have been associated with currently available phosphate binders as positive calcium balance and impaired outcomes with calcium-based phosphate binders or increased costs with non-calcium-based phosphate binders. Iron-based phosphate binders represent a new class of phosphate binders. Several iron-based phosphate binders have undergone testing in clinical trials. Ferric citrate (JTT-751) and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21) are the two iron-based binders that have passed to the clinical field after being found safe and effective in decreasing serum phosphate. Iron from ferric citrate is partially absorbed compared to sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Ferric citrate usage could result in an important reduction in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and IV iron usage, resulting in significant cost savings. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was effective in lowering serum phosphorus in dialysis patients with similar efficacy to sevelamer carbonate, but with lower pill burden, and better adherence. Ferric citrate may be more suited for the treatment of chronic hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients requiring iron supplements but its use may have been hampered by potential aluminum overload, as citrate facilitates its absorption; sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be more suited for hyperphosphatemic CKD patients not requiring iron supplementation, with low pill burden.","2015",,"Clin Kidney J",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

As serum hepcidin could aid diagnosis, we investigated its relationships with bone marrow iron distribution, hepcidin-ferroportin expression in bone marrow cells, and peripheral iron indices in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
METHODS: Fifty-four epoetin and iron naive CKD patients entered this prospective, observational study. According to bone marrow iron distribution (iliac crest biopsy, Perls' stain), 26 had iron deficiency anemia, 21 anemia of chronic disorders and 7 had normal iron stores. Medullar hepcidin and ferroportin expression (immunofluorescence (IF), semiquantitative scales) and serum hepcidin (Hep25 - ELISA) were the main studied parameters.
RESULTS: Low hepcidin and high ferroportin expression by erythroblast and macrophage were seen in iron deficiency anemia, while the opposites were true in anemia of chronic disorders. In regression analysis, higher Hep25 and ferritin predicted hepcidin expression (R(2)=0.48; P < 0.0001), while lower ferritin and Hep25 - predicted ferroportin expression (R(2) = 0.29; P = 0.003) by erythroblast; inflammation had no contribution. In ROC analysis, serum hepcidin and ferritin had similar moderate utility in differentiating iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disorders (AUC 0.63 95% CI 0.47-0.79 and 0.76 95% CI 0.61-0.90, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in anemic epoetin naive non-dialysis CKD patients, hepcidin and ferroportin expression by erythroblast and macrophage are closely related to bone marrow iron distribution. Although the hepcidin-ferroportin system seems regulated by ferritin-driven Hep25, serum hepcidin and peripheral iron indices are of little help in describing bone marrow iron status.","2015",,"Hematology"," OBJECTIVES : The hepcidin-ferroportin system is involved in both conditions associated with iron-restricted erythropoiesis in renal anemia : iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disorders ","observational study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Renal fibrosis is a final common feature that contributes to the progression of CKD; however, little is known about the association between renal iron accumulation and renal interstitial fibrosis in CKD. Here we investigate the effects of iron chelation on renal interstitial fibrosis in a rat model of CKD. CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in Sprague-Dawley rats. At 8 weeks after operation, 5/6 nephrectomized rats were administered an oral iron chelator, deferasirox (DFX), in chow for 8 weeks. Other CKD rats were given a normal diet. Sham-operative rats given a normal diet served as a control. CKD rats exhibited hypertension, glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis. Iron chelation with DFX did not change hypertension and glomerulosclerosis; however, renal interstitial fibrosis was attenuated in CKD rats. Consistent with these findings, renal gene expression of collagen type III and transforming growth factor-β was increased in CKD rats compared with the controls, while iron chelation suppressed these increments. In addition, a decrease in vimentin along an increase in E-cadherin in renal gene expression was observed in CKD rats with iron chelation. CKD rats also showed increased CD68-positive cells in the kidney, whereas its increase was attenuated by iron deprivation. Similarly, increased renal gene expression of CD68, tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was suppressed in CKD rats with iron chelation.

METHODS: We undertook a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of intravenous iron sucrose treatment (200mg/mL weekly for five weeks) in patients with chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and iron-deficiency anaemia receiving optimal treatment for chronic heart failure (N=60). Markers of disease severity, iron status, anaemia and inflammation were measured during a six-month follow-up period, and evaluation of echocardiographic parameters was performed at baseline and six months after treatment.
RESULTS: At six months after treatment initiation, intravenous iron was associated with reduced severity of the symptoms of chronic heart failure and improved renal function (both p<0.001 versus control). Also, ferritin and transferrin saturation levels were increased, as were haemoglobin levels, whereas inflammatory markers were reduced (all p<0.001 versus control).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of iron therapies for the treatment of adults with anaemia who are not pregnant or lactating and do not have chronic kidney disease.
SEARCH METHODS: We ran the search on 11 July 2013. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus (EBSCO Host), the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science (ISI WOS) Scientific Citation Index (SCI)-EXPANDED (1970) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI)-Science (1990) and Clinicaltrials.gov; we also screened reference lists. An updated search was run on 24 November 2014 but the results have not yet been incorporated into the review.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors independently selected references for further assessment by going through all titles and abstracts. Further selection was based on review of full-text articles for selected references.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted study data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and the mean difference (MD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed meta-analysis when possible, when I(2) was less than or equal to 80% using a fixed-effect or random-effects model, using Review Manager software. The range of point estimates for individual studies is presented when I(2) > 80%.
MAIN RESULTS: We included in this systematic review 4745 participants who were randomly assigned in 21 trials. Trials were conducted in a wide variety of clinical settings. Most trials included participants with mild to moderate anaemia and excluded participants who were allergic to iron therapy. All trials were at high risk of bias for one or more domains. We compared both oral iron and parenteral iron versus inactive controls and compared different iron preparations.The comparison between oral iron and inactive control revealed no evidence of clinical benefit in terms of mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.61; four studies, N = 659; very low-quality evidence). The point estimate of the mean difference in haemoglobin levels in individual studies ranged from 0.3 to 3.1 g/dL higher in the oral iron group than in the inactive control group. The proportion of participants who required blood transfusion was lower with oral iron than with inactive control (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; three studies, N = 546; very low-quality evidence). Evidence was inadequate for determination of the effect of parenteral iron on mortality versus oral iron (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.94; 10 studies, N = 2141; very low-quality evidence) or inactive control (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.69; six studies, N = 1009; very low-quality evidence). Haemoglobin levels were higher with parenteral iron than with oral iron (MD -0.50 g/dL, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.27; six studies, N = 769; very low-quality evidence). The point estimate of the mean difference in haemoglobin levels in individual studies ranged between 0.3 and 3.0 g/dL higher in the parenteral iron group than in the inactive control group. Differences in the proportion of participants requiring blood transfusion between parenteral iron and oral iron groups (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.58; two studies, N = 371; very low-quality evidence) or between parenteral iron groups and inactive controls (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06; eight studies, N = 1315; very low-quality evidence) were imprecise. Average blood volume transfused was less in the parenteral iron group than in the oral iron group (MD -0.54 units, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.12; very low-quality evidence) based on one study involving 44 people. Differences between therapies in quality of life or in the proportion of participants with serious adverse events were imprecise (very low-quality evidence). No trials reported severe allergic reactions due to parenteral iron, suggesting that these are rare. Adverse effects related to oral iron treatment included nausea, diarrhoea and constipation; most were mild.Comparisons of one iron preparation over another for mortality, haemoglobin or serious adverse events were imprecise. No information was available on quality of life. Thus, little evidence was found to support the use of one preparation or regimen over another.Subgroup analyses did not reveal consistent results; therefore we were unable to determine whether iron is useful in specific clinical situations, or whether iron therapy might be useful for people who are receiving erythropoietin.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: • Very low-quality evidence suggests that oral iron might decrease the proportion of people who require blood transfusion, and no evidence indicates that it decreases mortality. Oral iron might be useful in adults who can tolerate the adverse events, which are usually mild.• Very low-quality evidence suggests that intravenous iron results in a modest increase in haemoglobin levels compared with oral iron or inactive control without clinical benefit.• No evidence can be found to show any advantage of one iron preparation or regimen over another.• Additional randomised controlled trials with low risk of bias and powered to measure clinically useful outcomes such as mortality, quality of life and blood transfusion requirements are needed.","2014",,"Cochrane Database Syst Rev"," OBJECTIVES : To assess the safety and efficacy of iron therapies for the treatment of adults with anaemia who are not pregnant or lactating and do not have chronic kidney disease ","meta analysis",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

A good example of these new compounds is ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), which has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients who are intolerant to oral iron or present an unsatisfactory response to oral iron, and in adult patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). FCM is a robust and stable complex similar to ferritin, which minimizes the release of labile iron during administration, allowing higher doses to be administered in a single application and with a favorable cost-effective rate. Cumulative information from randomized, controlled, multicenter trials on a diverse range of indications, including patients with chronic heart failure, postpartum anemia/abnormal uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, NDD-CKD, and those undergoing hemodialysis, supports the efficacy of FCM for iron replacement in patients with iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Furthermore, as FCM is a dextran-free iron-carbohydrate complex (which has a very low risk for hypersensitivity reactions) with a small proportion of the reported adverse effects in a large number of subjects who received FCM, it may be considered a safe drug. Therefore, FCM appears as an interesting option to apply high doses of iron as a single infusion in a few minutes in order to obtain the quick replacement of iron stores. The present review on FCM summarizes diverse aspects such as pharmacology characteristics and analyzes trials on the efficacy/safety of FCM versus oral iron and different iv iron compounds in multiple clinical scenarios. Additionally, the information on cost effectiveness and data on change in quality of life are also discussed.","2014",,"Drug Des Devel Ther",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 149 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin, 9.0-12.0 g/dL; transferrin saturation [TSAT]≤ 30%, serum ferritin ≤ 300 ng/mL), and serum phosphate levels ≥ 4.0 to 6.0mg/dL. Use of intravenous iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was prohibited.
INTERVENTION: Randomization to treatment for 12 weeks with ferric citrate coordination complex (ferric citrate) or placebo.
OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary end points were change in TSAT and serum phosphate level from baseline to end of study. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline to end of treatment in values for ferritin, hemoglobin, intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), urinary phosphate excretion, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.
RESULTS: Ferric citrate treatment increased mean TSAT from 22% ± 7% (SD) to 32% ± 14% and reduced serum phosphate levels from 4.5 ± 0.6 to 3.9 ± 0.6 mg/dL, while placebo exerted no effect on TSAT (21% ± 8% to 20% ± 8%) and less effect on serum phosphate level (4.7 ± 0.6 to 4.4 ± 0.8 mg/dL; between-group P<0.001 for each). Ferric citrate increased hemoglobin levels (from 10.5 ± 0.8 to 11.0 ± 1.0 g/dL; P<0.001 vs placebo), reduced urinary phosphate excretion 39% (P<0.001 vs placebo), and reduced serum intact FGF-23 levels from a median of 159 (IQR, 102-289) to 105 (IQR, 65-187) pg/mL (P=0.02 vs placebo).

Controversies exist about the optimal route of administration for iron therapy. Liposomal iron, a new generation oral iron with high gastrointestinal absorption and bioavailability and a low incidence of side effects, seems to be a promising new strategy of iron replacement. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine whether liposomal iron, compared with intravenous (IV) iron, improves anaemia in ND-CKD patients.
METHODS: In this randomized, open-label trial, 99 patients with CKD (stage 3-5, not on dialysis) and iron deficiency anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) ≤12 g/dL, ferritin ≤100 ng/mL, transferrin saturation ≤25%] were assigned (2:1) to receive oral liposomal iron (30 mg/day, Group OS) or a total dose of 1000 mg of IV iron gluconate (125 mg infused weekly) (Group IV) for 3 months. The patients were followed-up for the treatment period and 1 month after drug withdrawal. The primary end point was to evaluate the effects of the two treatments on Hb levels; the iron status, compliance and adverse effects were also evaluated.
RESULTS: The short-term therapy with IV iron produced a more rapid Hb increase compared with liposomal iron, although the final increase in Hb was similar with either treatment; the difference between the groups was statistically significant at the first month and such difference disappeared at the end of treatment. After iron withdrawal, Hb concentrations remained stable in Group IV, while recovered to baseline in the OS group. The replenishment of iron stores was greater in the IV group. The incidence of adverse event was significantly lower in the oral group (P < 0.001), and the adherence was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that oral liposomal iron is a safe and efficacious alternative to IV iron gluconate to correct anaemia in ND-CKD patients, although its effects on repletion of iron stores and on stability of Hb after drug discontinuation are lower.","2015",,"Nephrol Dial Transplant",,"randomized controlled trial",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

It minimizes reliance on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and may be beneficial in reducing overall cardiovascular risks through its effects on platelet counts (PLT). We have examined the effects of i.v. iron on PLT in patients with CKD.
METHODS: Two hundred and three patients with CKD, referred to a single teaching hospital in UK for i.v. iron therapy, received low molecular-weight iron dextran at a median dose of 1000 milligrams given over a median time of 2 h and 40 min. PLT at baseline were compared with the measurements taken during a 4-month follow-up period post-infusion.
RESULTS: PLT were checked at various points following i.v. iron treatment. Compared with baseline, mean reduction in PLT ranged between 10.1 and 23.6 (×10(9) /L) during consecutive 15-days intervals post-treatment. At the reference point of 90-days post-infusion, the drop in PLT was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

We investigated the effect of intravenous iron repletion on platelet counts in ND-CKD patients with and without concomitant darbepoetin administration.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of ND-CKD patients with iron deficiency anemia treated with low molecular weight iron dextran (LMWID) between 2005 and 2009 at our CKD clinic. The primary end-point was change in platelet count 60 days post infusion of LMWID in those with and without concomitant darbepoetin administration. Secondary end-points were the correlations between changes in platelet count and iron indices.
RESULTS: A total of 108 patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The decrease in platelet counts in response to iron repletion was statistically significant (305.72 ± 108.86 vs 255.58 ± 78.97, P = < .0001). The decrease in platelet count was independent of concomitant darbepoetin use. Bivariate regression analysis between baseline platelet count and transferrin saturation by iron (TSAT) showed a negative association (βTSAT = -5.82, P = .0007) and moderate correlation (R = 0.32). Following iron treatment, the within individual changes in platelet count in 60 days were not related to changes in TSAT (βΔTSAT = -0.41, P = .399) and demonstrated a poor correlation (R = 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral iron treatment by LMWID is associated with reduction in platelet counts in iron deficient anemic ND-CKD patients.

Considering the high content of ∼20% w/w covalently bound iron in SBR759 and expected chronic administration to patients, absorption of small amounts of iron released from the drug substance could result in potential iron overload and toxicity.

Hepcidin varied from 0.2 to 193 ng/mL. The median increased from 23.3 ng/mL [8.8-28.7] to 36.1 ng/mL [14.1-92.3] when mGFR decreased from ≥60 to <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.02).

METHODS: Ferinject® assessment in patients with Iron deficiency anaemia and Non-Dialysis-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (FIND-CKD) was a 56-week, open-label, multicentre, prospective and randomized study of 626 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients were randomized (1:1:2) to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting a higher (400-600 µg/L) or lower (100-200 µg/L) ferritin or oral iron therapy. The primary end point was time to initiation of other anaemia management (ESA, other iron therapy or blood transfusion) or haemoglobin (Hb) trigger of two consecutive values <10 g/dL during Weeks 8-52.
RESULTS: The primary end point occurred in 36 patients (23.5%), 49 patients (32.2%) and 98 patients (31.8%) in the high-ferritin FCM, low-ferritin FCM and oral iron groups, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-0.95; P = 0.026 for high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron]. The increase in Hb was greater with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (P = 0.014) and a greater proportion of patients achieved an Hb increase ≥1 g/dL with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (HR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.52-2.72; P < 0.001). Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with oral iron, IV FCM targeting a ferritin of 400-600 µg/L quickly reached and maintained Hb level, and delayed and/or reduced the need for other anaemia management including ESAs. Within the limitations of this trial, no renal toxicity was observed, with no difference in cardiovascular or infectious events.

,"24867675","Coupling fibroblast growth factor 23 production and cleavage: iron deficiency, rickets, and kidney disease.","Wolf M","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: High levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) cause the rare disorders of hypophosphatemic rickets and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite major advances in understanding FGF23 biology, fundamental aspects of FGF23 regulation in health and in CKD remain mostly unknown.
RECENT FINDINGS: Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in FGF23 that prevent its proteolytic cleavage, but affected individuals experience a waxing and waning course of phosphate wasting. This led to the discovery that iron deficiency is an environmental trigger that stimulates FGF23 expression and hypophosphatemia in ADHR. Unlike osteocytes in ADHR, normal osteocytes couple increased FGF23 production with commensurately increased FGF23 cleavage to ensure that normal phosphate homeostasis is maintained in the event of iron deficiency. Simultaneous measurement of FGF23 by intact and C-terminal assays supported these breakthroughs by providing minimally invasive insight into FGF23 production and cleavage in bone. These findings also suggest a novel mechanism of FGF23 elevation in patients with CKD, who are often iron deficient and demonstrate increased FGF23 production and decreased FGF23 cleavage, consistent with an acquired state that mimics the molecular pathophysiology of ADHR.
SUMMARY: Iron deficiency stimulates FGF23 production, but normal osteocytes couple increased FGF23 production with increased cleavage to maintain normal circulating levels of biologically active hormone. These findings uncover a second level of FGF23 regulation within osteocytes, failure of which culminates in elevated levels of biologically active FGF23 in ADHR and perhaps CKD.","2014",,"Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : High levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) cause the rare disorders of hypophosphatemic rickets and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Oral phosphate binders are prescribed to patients with CKD to prevent absorption of dietary phosphate. Currently available binders have been associated with impaired outcomes (calcium-based binders) or are expensive (non-calcium-based binders). Iron-based phosphate binders represent a new class of phosphate binders. Four iron-based phosphate binders have undergone testing in clinical trials. The development of fermagate and SBR759 is currently on hold due to suboptimal and adverse effect profiles in at least some clinical trials. Ferric citrate and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21) are at different stages of application for regulatory approval after being found safe and efficacious in decreasing serum phosphate. Iron from ferric citrate is more readily absorbed than that from sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was launched in the USA in 2014 for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in adult dialysis patients. Ferric citrate may be more suited for chronic treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients requiring iron supplements but its use may have to be limited in time because of potential for iron overload in patients not needing iron or not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In contrast, sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be more suited for hyperphosphatemic CKD patients not requiring iron supplements.","2014",,"Drugs",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Our goal was to evaluate the safety of TDI in this setting. We conducted a retrospective chart review spanning a 5 year period (2002-2007), including all patients with CKD and IDA who were treated with iron dextran TDI. Patient demographics were noted, and laboratory values for creatinine, hemoglobin and iron stores were recorded pre- and post-dose. TDI diluted in normal saline was administered intravenously over 4-6 hours after an initial test dose. One hundred fifty-three patients received a total of 250 doses of TDI (mean ± SD=971 ± 175 mg); age was 69 ± 12 years and creatinine 3.3 ± 1.9 mg/dL. All stages of CKD were represented (stage 4 commonest). Hemoglobin and iron stores improved post-TDI (P<0.001). None of the patients experienced an anaphylactic reaction or death. Adverse events (AEs) were noted in 8 out of 250 administered doses (3.2%). The most common AEs were itching, chills and back pain. One hundred and ten doses of high molecular weight (HMW) iron dextran produced 6 AEs (5.45%), whereas 140 doses of low molecular weight (LMW) iron dextran produced 2 AEs (1.43%), a non-significant trend (P=0.1433 by Fishers Exact Test). Iron dextran TDI is relatively safe and effective in correcting IDA in geriatric CKD patients. Fewer AEs were noted with the LMW compared to the HMW product.

Our study investigated the causative role of iron sucrose in leukocyte-endothelium interactions, an index of early atherogenesis, and subsequent atherosclerosis in the mouse remnant kidney model. We found that expression levels of intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and adhesion of U937 cells increased in iron-treated human aortic endothelial cells through upregulated NADPH oxidase (NOx) and NF-κB signaling. We then measured mononuclear-endothelial adhesion and atherosclerotic lesions of the proximal aorta in male C57BL/6 mice with subtotal nephrectomy, male apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice with uninephrectomy, and sham-operated mice subjected to saline or parenteral iron loading. Iron sucrose significantly increased tissue superoxide production, expression of tissue cell adhesion molecules, and endothelial adhesiveness in mice with subtotal nephrectomy. Moreover, iron sucrose exacerbated atherosclerosis in the aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice with uninephrectomy. In patients with CKD, intravenous iron sucrose increased circulating mononuclear superoxide production, expression of soluble adhesion molecules, and mononuclear-endothelial adhesion compared with healthy subjects or untreated patients. In summary, iron sucrose aggravated endothelial dysfunction through NOx/NF-κB/CAM signaling, increased mononuclear-endothelial adhesion, and exacerbated atherosclerosis in mice with remnant kidneys.

We investigated hepcidin and traditional iron storage marker utility in predicting haemoglobin increment following bolus intravenous iron.
METHODS: The cohort included 129 consecutive non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients that attended for intravenous iron over a 6-month period. Serum hepcidin-25 levels (determined by mass spectrometry) pre iron infusion and 6 weeks post were compared with ferritin and transferrin saturation in multivariate models.
RESULTS: Log10 ferritin [coefficient 0.559 (0.435-0.684) p < 0.001] and log10 high-sensitive C-reactive protein [coefficient 0.092 (0.000-0.184) p = 0.049] were significantly associated with baseline log10 hepcidin-25 levels. Log10 estimated glomerular filtration rate was the only independent determinant of pre-infusion haemoglobin [coefficient 1.37 (0.16-2.59) p = 0.027]. Log10 hepcidin-25 was an independent predictor of haemoglobin increment 6 weeks following iron infusion [coefficient -0.84 (-1.38 to -0.31) p = 0.002]. Ferritin, transferrin saturation and hepcidin had similar predictive utility for a 1 g/dl haemoglobin increase (c-statistics: 0.68, 0.70, 0.69).

This in vitro study assessed phosphate binding and Fe release properties of the novel iron-based phosphate binder PA21.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phosphate adsorption and Fe release were assessed under conditions simulating administration of PA21 on an empty stomach and full stomach across a pH range to which PA21 would be exposed during passage through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
RESULTS: PA21 showed a robust phosphate binding capacity over the entire physiologically relevant pH range. The high binding capacity at low pH indicates that phosphate binding could begin in the stomach. Under the current experimental setting, the maximal bound phosphate to Fe ratio was 0.47 mmol P/mmol Fe. The largest amount of Fe release was observed at the lowest pH without phosphate and was much lower in the presence of phosphate. These results are in line with the formation of iron phosphate at low pH, as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermodynamic calculations. Fe release was minimal (≤ 0.35%) across pH 2.5 - 8.5.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that PA21 has potent phosphate binding capacity and low iron release over a physiologically relevant pH range in the GI tract.

,"24649744","Toxic effects of IV iron preparations in CKD patients.","Vaziri ND","Loss of blood associated with hemodialysis procedures and laboratory testing, together with impaired iron absorption due to elevation of hepcidin, invariably cause iron deficiency in end-stage renal disease patients. For this reason, nearly all ESRD patients require intravenous iron to replete iron stores. Unfortunately, intravenously administered iron is often used routinely with inadequate attention to the body iron stores or severity of systemic inflammation. This has led to an epidemic of iron overload in the ESRD population. Only a minute amount (3-4 mg) of the total body iron (3-4 g in an adult man) resides in the plasma bound to transferrin, which serves as a safe vehicle for iron transport in the circulation. IV iron products are generally administered as bolus injections of 100 to 1000 mg, which far exceeds the available pool of free transferrin and represents a huge quantity compared to the intestinal iron absorption of 1 to 2 mg/day in the course of 3 to 4 meals. Administration of these products results in an increased plasma level of catalytically active non-transferrin bound iron and the rise in the biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. IV iron bypasses the biological safeguards for the transport and handling of iron and helps to intensify chronic kidney disease-associated oxidative stress and inflammation. As briefly described in this review, indiscriminate use of IV iron can accelerate cardiovascular disease, promote microbial infections, aggravate viral hepatitis, and worsen diabetes and diabetic complications in such patients. For these reasons IV iron should be used judiciously in this vulnerable population.","2014",,"Nephrol News Issues",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

This interventional open labeled randomised controlled study comparing the effect of intravenous and oral iron therapy in improving red cell indices and iron status in anaemic pre-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease was carried out to determine iron status in anaemic pre-dialysis CKD patients to assess the benefit of parenteral iron supplementation as against empirical oral iron in CKD patients with iron deficiency.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients attending the renal clinic over a six month period were screened. Forty- one subjects (68.3%) were found to be anaemic and were subsequently studied.
RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged between 19 and 71 years with a mean age of 39 years. The mean serum creatinine and mean creatinine clearance were 201.80 (70.25)?mol/L and 37.90 (± 12.17)ml/minute respectively. The haematocrit concentration was found to correlate inversely with the level of serum creatinine and 56.1% of the anaemic patients had iron deficiency.

In the present study, we examined the effect of an iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO), on renal fibrosis in mice with surgically induced unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO). Mice were divided into 4 groups: UUO with vehicle, UUO with DFO, sham with vehicle, and sham with DFO. One week after surgery, augmented renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the expression of collagen I, III, and IV increased in mice with UUO; these changes were suppressed by DFO treatment. Similarly, UUO-induced macrophage infiltration of renal interstitial tubules was reduced in UUO mice treated with DFO. UUO-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins was abrogated by DFO treatment. DFO inhibited the activation of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-Smad3 pathway in UUO mice. UUO-induced NADPH oxidase activity and p22(phox) expression were attenuated by DFO. In the kidneys of UUO mice, divalent metal transporter 1, ferroportin, and ferritin expression was higher and transferrin receptor expression was lower than in sham-operated mice. Increased renal iron content was observed in UUO mice, which was reduced by DFO treatment.

METHODS: We studied the association between Hb level and iron indexes combining 2 or 3 of the following markers: serum ferritin (<40 ng/mL), transferrin saturation (TSAT<20%) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC<50 µmol/L) in 1011 outpatients with non-dialysis CKD participating in the Nephrotest study. All had glomerular filtration rates measured (mGFR) by (51)Cr-EDTA renal clearance; 199 also had hepcidin measures.
RESULTS: The TSAT-TIBC-ferritin index explained Hb variation better than indexes combining TSAT-TIBC or ferritin-TSAT. It showed hypotransferrinaemia and non-inflammatory functional iron deficiency (ID) to be more common than either absolute or inflammatory ID: 20%, 19%, 6%, and 2%, respectively. Hb was lower in all abnormal, compared with normal, iron profiles, and decreased more when mGFR was below 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (interaction p<0.0001). In patients with mGFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), the Hb decreases associated with hypotransferrinaemia, non-inflammatory functional ID, and absolute ID were 0.83±0.16 g/dL, 0.51±0.18 and 0.89±0.29, respectively. Compared with normal iron profiles, hepcidin was severely depressed in absolute ID but higher in hypotransferrinaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined TSAT-TIBC-ferritin index identifies hypotransferrinaemia and non-inflammatory functional ID as the major mechanisms of iron disorders in CKD anaemia.

The objective of this survey was to describe the nephrologists attitude on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD stages 3, 4 and 5), with iron deficiency anemia and no response/intolerance to oral iron therapy. Furthermore, this survey describes the nephrologists view about the impact of lack of anemia correction on patient health, as well as the influence of organization and management of nephrological centers on IV iron management. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 60 nephrologists were interviewed via web by using an interactive simulation that investigates nephrologists clinical and therapeutic approach on 3 different types of patients; subsequently, a questionnaire was administered with in-deeper questions. RESULTS. Regarding the first virtual patient, 64% of nephrologists still choose oral iron, while IV iron was chosen by 16% of them. 36% opted for ESA. For the other two virtual patients the most selected treatments were combinations of oral iron + ESA (42% and 36%) or IV iron + ESA (21% and 38%), respectively. According to what was perceived by nephrologists, issues related to IV iron are: patient discomfort due to frequent hospital transfers for IV administration (50%), inadequate center organization (48%), fear of damaging the venous tree (40%). CONCLUSIONS. Half of the nephrologists stated they are unsatisfied with available iron therapies. Difficult therapy management and restrictions of health structure were identified as barriers to the prescription of IV iron therapy.

Liposomial iron is a preparation of ferric pyrophosphate carried within a phospholipidic membrane. Compared to other oral formulations, it is well absorbed from the gut and demonstrates high bioavailability together with a lower incidence of side effects. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with liposomial iron compared to intravenous iron in a CKD population with anemia and iron deficiency. Our study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, fourth-phase study. Enrollment for the study began in October 2011 and CKD 3, 4 and 5 patients were randomized to receive either intravenous iron or liposomial iron in a 1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was set as the increase of hemoglobin from baseline.

We review the pathophysiology impairing normal intestinal iron absorption in CKD and compare the characteristics of newer intravenous (i.v.) iron agents to the longstanding i.v. iron products in the market.
RECENT FINDINGS: The newer iron products, ferumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose, and iron isomaltoside, more avidly bind iron, minimizing the release of labile iron during infusions, thus permitting large dose infusions. These irons also have more complex carbohydrate shells than their predecessors, which may also diminish reactions. Newer agents can be routinely administered at higher single doses, in as little as 15 min, with an acceptable safety profile.
SUMMARY: Newer i.v. iron products permit the rapid, and sometimes complete, repletion of iron-deficient patients with a single dose. However, further studies examining the long-term risks and benefits of i.v. iron repletion are needed.","2014",,"Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Iron deficiency is a major factor in the prevalence and severity of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"24373521","High dose intravenous iron, mineral homeostasis and intact FGF23 in normal and uremic rats.","Gravesen E","BACKGROUND: High iron load might have a number of toxic effects in the organism. Recently intravenous (iv) iron has been proposed to induce elevation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia in iron deficient subjects. High levels of FGF23 are associated with increased mortality in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. CKD patients are often treated with iv iron therapy in order to maintain iron stores and erythropoietin responsiveness, also in the case of not being iron depleted. Therefore, the effect of a single high iv dose of two different iron preparations, iron isomaltoside 1000 (IIM) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), on plasma levels of FGF23 and phosphate was examined in normal and uremic iron repleted rats.
METHODS: Iron was administered iv as a single high dose of 80 mg/kg bodyweight and the effects on plasma levels of iFGF23, phosphate, Ca2+, PTH, transferrin, ferritin and iron were examined in short and long term experiments (n = 99). Blood samples were obtained at time 0, 30, 60, 180 minutes, 24 and 48 hours and in a separate study after 1 week. Uremia was induced by 5/6-nephrectomy.
RESULTS: Nephrectomized rats had significant uremia, hyperparathyroidism and elevated FGF23. Iron administration resulted in significant increases in plasma ferritin levels. No significant differences were seen in plasma levels of iFGF23, phosphate and PTH between the experimental groups at any time point within 48 hours or at 1 week after infusion of the iron compounds compared to vehicle.
CONCLUSIONS: In non-iron depleted normal and uremic rats a single high dose of either of two intravenous iron preparations, iron isomaltoside 1000, and ferric carboxymaltose, had no effect on plasma levels of iFGF23 and phosphate for up to seven days.","2013",,"BMC Nephrol",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is also a problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in those on haemodialysis. Excessive iron in the liver of CHC patients contributes to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally HCC, while iron depletion is beneficial. In CHC patients without CKD, in HCV-infected experimental animals and in cell culture studies, serum hepcidin levels and/or cellular hepcidin expression are low and directly suppressed by HCV, radical oxygen species, growth factors and/or transcription factors. In contrast, antiviral therapy (e.g. with pegylated interferon-alpha combined with ribavirin) raises hepcidin levels and reduces iron overload in patients with CHC. Hepcidin directly inhibits HCV replication mediated by STAT3 activation. HCV circumvents hepatic innate antiviral defence by lowering hepcidin. If hepcidin is also low in CKD patients with CHC, iron supplementation should be avoided even in CKD patients with CHC treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.","2014",,"Nephrol Dial Transplant",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

In CKD, elevated hepcidin and vitamin D deficiency are associated with anemia. Therefore, we explored a possible role for vitamin D in iron homeostasis. Treatment of cultured hepatocytes or monocytes with prohormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D or active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreased expression of hepcidin mRNA by 0.5-fold, contrasting the stimulatory effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D on related antibacterial proteins such as cathelicidin. Promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that direct transcriptional suppression of hepcidin gene (HAMP) expression mediated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binding to the vitamin D receptor caused the decrease in hepcidin mRNA levels. Suppression of HAMP expression was associated with a concomitant increase in expression of the cellular target for hepcidin, ferroportin protein, and decreased expression of the intracellular iron marker ferritin. In a pilot study with healthy volunteers, supplementation with a single oral dose of vitamin D (100,000 IU vitamin D2) increased serum levels of 25D-hydroxyvitamin D from 27±2 ng/ml before supplementation to 44±3 ng/ml after supplementation (P<0.001). This response was associated with a 34% decrease in circulating levels of hepcidin within 24 hours of vitamin D supplementation (P<0.05). These data show that vitamin D is a potent regulator of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis in humans and highlight a potential new strategy for the management of anemia in patients with low vitamin D and/or CKD.","2014",,"J Am Soc Nephrol",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

This response proves advantageous in the short-term to restrain iron availability to pathogens, but ultimately leads to severe anemia, and impairs the response to erythropoietin (Epo) and iron. Homozygosity for the common C282Y and H63D HFE polymorphisms influence iron metabolism by hampering hepcidin release by hepatocytes in response to increased iron stores, thereby resulting in inadequate inhibition of the activity of Ferroportin-1, inappropriately high iron absorption and recycling, and iron overload. However, in hemodialysis patients, carriage of HFE mutations may confer an adaptive benefit by decreasing hepcidin release in response to iron infusion and inflammation, thereby improving iron availability to erythropoiesis, anemia control, the response to Epo, and possibly survival. Therefore, anti-hepcidin therapies may improve anemia management in hemodialysis. However, HFE mutations directly favor hemoglobinization independently of hepcidin, and reduce macrophages activation in response to inflammation, whereas hepcidin might also play a beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-microbic action during sepsis, so that direct inhibition of HFE-mediated regulation of iron metabolism may represent a valuable alternative therapeutic target.

We evaluated the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), a non-dextran parenteral iron permitting large single-dose infusions, versus iron sucrose in patients with iron-deficiency anemia and NDD-CKD.
METHODS: A total of 2584 participants were randomized to two doses of FCM 750 mg in one week, or iron sucrose 200 mg administered in up to five infusions in 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change to highest hemoglobin from baseline to Day 56. The primary composite safety endpoint included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and hyper- and hypotensive events.
RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin increase was 1.13 g/dL in the FCM group and 0.92 g/dL in the iron sucrose group (95% CI, 0.13-0.28). Similar results were observed across all subgroups, except Stage 2 CKD. More subjects in the FCM group achieved a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.0 g/dL between baseline and Day 56 (48.6 versus 41.0%; 95% CI, 3.6-11.6%).

However, parenteral iron supplementation is usually safe and without major side effects. Regarding current data, none of the iron preparations is showing definitive superiority. Although uncommon, iron preparations containing dextran can lead to severe side effects, therefore these preparations appear to have an inferior safety profile.

Levels of intracellular catalytic iron may increase when glomerular and renal tubular cells are injured. Reducing the excessive luminal or intracellular levels of iron in the kidney could be a promising approach to treat AKI and CKD. Understanding the role of iron in kidney injury and as a therapeutic target requires insight into the mechanisms of iron metabolism in the kidney, the role of endogenous proteins involved in iron chelation and transport, including hepcidin, NGAL, the NGAL receptor and divalent metal transporter 1, and iron-induced toxic effects. This Review summarizes emerging knowledge, which suggests that complex mechanisms of iron metabolism exist in the kidney, modulated directly or indirectly by cellular iron content, inflammation, ischaemia and oxidative stress.

However, little is known about the effects of isolated iron restriction against CKD. We have recently reported that iron restriction prevents the development of renal damage in the well established 5/6 nephrectomy rat model of CKD. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic effects of iron restriction on preexisting hypertension and renal damage in a rat model of CKD.
METHODS: CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in Sprague-Dawley rats. After surgery, 5/6 nephrectomized rats were given an iron-restricted diet from 1 day to 16 weeks for prevention protocol or from 8 to 16 weeks for rescue protocol. Other CKD rats were given a normal diet.
RESULTS: At 16 weeks after surgery, CKD rats developed hypertension and renal damage. Early intervention with iron restriction prevented the development of hypertension and vascular remodeling. By contrast, late intervention with iron restriction did not remarkably ameliorate preexisting hypertension and vascular remodeling in CKD rats. On the contrary, late intervention with iron restriction prevented further progression of preexisting renal damage in CKD rats. Interestingly, iron restriction led to increased urinary sodium and decreased urinary potassium excretions in CKD rats. Moreover, iron restriction markedly attenuated renal expression of nuclear mineralocorticoid receptor and Rac1 activity in CKD rats.
CONCLUSION: Iron restriction prevented further deterioration of preexisting renal damage. The beneficial effects of iron restriction on renal damage seem to be associated with inhibition of renal mineralocorticoid receptor signaling.","2013",,"J Hypertens"," OBJECTIVE : Iron accumulation is associated with the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Baseline clinical and laboratory data were collected for all patients. The primary and secondary outcomes for the study were hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration and iron indices [ferritin and percentage transferrin saturation (TSAT)] at the end of 6 months respectively. Adverse events were also compared.
RESULTS: The baseline demographic characteristics and laboratory values were similar for the two groups. After 6 months of treatment, Hb in the HIP group was 117 g/L and 113 g/L in the IV sucrose group (p = 0.37). The TSAT at 6 months was not different between the two groups {p = 0.82}but the serum ferritin was significantly higher in the IV iron sucrose group {85.5 ug/L in HIP and 244 ug/L; p = 0.004}.

,"23379486","Hepcidin is a potential regulator of iron status in chronic kidney disease.","Tsuchiya K","Hepcidin is a small defensin-like peptide produced primarily by hepatocytes, but also by other cells, including macrophages. In addition to hepcidin's antimicrobial properties, it is the main regulator of iron metabolism and controls both the amount of dietary iron absorbed in the duodenum and the iron release by reticuloendothelial cells. Hepcidin expression is upregulated by a variety of stimuli, including inflammation and iron overload, and downregulated by anemia, hypoxia, and iron deficiency. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased serum hepcidin levels, and the increased levels may contribute to the development and severity of anemia and to resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Elevated serum hepcidin levels contribute to the dysregulation of iron homeostasis in CKD patients. Although parenteral iron supplementation can bypass some of the iron-blocking effects of hepcidin in CKD patients with anemia, and free iron and iron stores increase as a result, the anemia is only partially corrected, and the ESA dose requirements remain significantly higher than needed for physiological replacement. Treatment with agents that lower serum hepcidin levels or inhibit its actions may be an effective strategy for restoring normal iron homeostasis and improving anemia in CKD patients. The aim of this article was to review the regulation of hepcidin levels and the role of hepcidin in CKD-related anemia, and to discuss hepcidin's potential as a clinical biomarker and several investigational treatments designed to lower serum hepcidin levels.","2013",,"Ther Apher Dial"," The aim of this article was to review the regulation of hepcidin levels and the role of hepcidin in CKD-related anemia , and to discuss hepcidin's potential as a clinical biomarker and several investigational treatments designed to lower serum hepcidin levels "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that lowered serum transferrin level may contribute to functional anemia and erythropoietin hypo responsiveness by the failure to transport accumulated tissue iron to the relevant target tissue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study subjects were divided into four groups. Group-A: HDCKD Patients receiving iv iron (n=290). Group-B: Patients not initiated on to hemodialysis (NDCKD), and received oral iron (n=38). Group-C: HDCKD patients with erythropoietin hypo responsiveness (n=9). Group-D: Healthy controls (n=36). The group-A, patients were sub-divided into five groups (A-1 to A-5) based on their serum ferritin levels.
RESULTS: Serum ferritin and tissue iron levels in group-A and C patients were significantly greater than the group-D(p<0.0001) and group-B patients(p<0.001). Transferrin level of group-A and C showed lowered values and consequently a higher %TSAT when compared to group-D. The percent of patients with iron overload was 2.6%, 31%, and 44% in group-B, group-A and group-C respectively. Serum transferrin level significantly correlated with TIBC in group-A and B patients (p<0.0001;p<0.05 respectively). Transferrin level significantly correlated with TIBC in all subgroups of HDCKD(p<0.05) with the exception in subgroup-A2 and with hemoglobin in subgroups A3 (p<0.05) and A5(p<0.01) respectively.

Excess levels of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin are thought to contribute to anemia in CKD patients by decreasing iron availability from the diet and from body stores. Adenine treatment in rats has been proposed as an animal model of anemia of CKD with high hepcidin levels that mirrors the condition in human patients.
METHODS: We developed a modified adenine-induced kidney disease model with a higher survival rate than previously reported models, while maintaining persistent kidney disease and anemia. We then tested whether the small molecule bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor LDN-193189, which was previously shown to lower hepcidin levels in rodents, mobilized iron into the plasma and improved iron-restricted erythropoiesis in this model.
RESULTS: Adenine-treated rats exhibited increased hepatic hepcidin mRNA, decreased serum iron, increased spleen iron content, low hemoglobin (Hb) and inappropriately low erythropoietin (EPO) levels relative to the degree of anemia. LDN-193189 administration to adenine-treated rats lowered hepatic hepcidin mRNA, mobilized stored iron into plasma and increased Hb content of reticulocytes.

,"23314137","Use of intravenous iron supplementation in chronic kidney disease: an update.","Macdougall IC","Iron deficiency is an important clinical concern in chronic kidney disease (CKD), giving rise to iron-deficiency anemia and impaired cellular function. Oral supplementation, in particular with ferrous salts, is associated with a high rate of gastrointestinal side effects and is poorly absorbed, a problem that is avoided with intravenous iron. The most stable intravenous iron complexes (eg, iron dextran, ferric carboxymaltose, ferumoxytol, and iron isomaltoside 1000) can be given in higher single doses and more rapidly than less stable preparations (eg, sodium ferric gluconate). Iron complexes that contain dextran or dextran-derived ligands can cause dextran-induced anaphylactic reactions, which cannot occur with dextran-free preparations such as ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose. Test doses are advisable for conventional dextran-containing compounds. Iron supplementation is recommended for all CKD patients with anemia who receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, whether or not they require dialysis. Intravenous iron is the preferred route of administration in hemodialysis patients, with randomized trials showing a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin levels for intravenous versus oral iron and a low rate of treatment-related adverse events. In the nondialysis CKD population, the erythropoietic response is also significantly higher using intravenous versus oral iron, and tolerability is at least as good. Moreover, in some nondialysis patients intravenous iron supplementation can avoid, or at least delay, the need for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In conclusion, we now have the ability to achieve iron replenishment rapidly and conveniently in dialysis-dependent and nondialysis-dependent CKD patients without compromising safety.","2013",,"Iran J Kidney Dis",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"23762920","NULL",,"None: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which develops early in the course of CKD and becomes increasingly severe as kidney function deteriorates. Iron deficiency anemia is a continuous process evolving in three stages. The first phase is the depletion of storage iron (stage I), where total body iron is decreased but hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis and red cell indices remain unaffected. Both these indices change when the supply of iron to bone marrow becomes problematic (iron deficient erythropoiesis, or stage II). In stage III the iron supply is insufficient to maintain a normal Hb concentration, and eventually iron deficiency anemia develops. The management of anemia in CKD patients must strike an appropriate balance between stimulating generation of erythroblasts (erythropoiesis) and maintaining sufficient iron levels for optimum Hb production. It is important to assess iron stores and the availability of iron for erythropoiesis, as adequate iron status is integral to both iron and anemia management in CKD patients. The major cause of iron deficiency is blood loss, particularly for dialysis patients. Dialysis patients are in a state of continuous iron loss from gastrointestinal bleeding (very common), blood drawing, and/or, most importantly, with hemodialysis, the dialysis treatment itself. A CKD patient who receives treatment with erythropoietic-stimulating agents (ESAs) for the anemia often develops iron deficiency, because the iron requirements for achieving a response to ESA treatment usually cannot be met by mobilization of the patient’s iron stores alone. Therefore, supplemental iron therapy, either given orally or intravenously, is often needed among dialysis patients who receive recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) or darbepoetin alfa treatment. Thus, iron management (iron status assessment and iron treatment) is an essential part of the treatment of anemia associated with CKD, as there are concerns regarding the adverse effects associated with both elevated doses of ESAs and supplemental (intravenous or oral) iron. Classical iron status tests, of which ferritin and transferring saturation (TSAT) are the most widely used, reflect either the level of iron in tissue stores or the adequacy of iron for erythropoiesis. Though widely used, classical laboratory biomarkers of iron status are not without drawbacks when used in CKD patients: CKD is a pro-inflammatory state, and the biological variability of serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin is known to be large in the context of underlying inflammation. Furthermore, results from a meta-analysis of 55 studies (published before 1990) showed that ferritin radioimmunoassay was the most powerful test (a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95; 95% CI 0.94, 0.96), compared with mean cell volume determination, TSAT, and red cell volume distribution, for diagnosing adult patients with iron deficiency, but test performances varied between patients with and those without inflammatory (e.g., CKD patients) or liver disease. The accurate assessment of iron status is dependent on the validity and reliability of laboratory test results, and differences in test performance pose a dilemma regarding the most appropriate test to guide treatment decisions.","NULL",,"Biomarkers for Assessing and Managing Iron Deficiency Anemia in Late-Stage Chronic Kidney Disease: Future Research Needs: Identification of Future Research Needs From Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 83",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a stable, non-dextran-containing iron formulation developed for rapid IV administration in high doses with controlled delivery of iron into target tissues. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety of FCM compared with standard medical care (SMC) in dialysis (HD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
METHODS: Adults 18-85 years of age with CKD were enrolled. NDD-CKD (n = 204) patients received an undiluted IV dose of FCM (15 mg/kg to a maximum of 1000 mg IV) and HD-CKD (n = 50) patients received an undiluted IV push of 200 mg ~30-60 min into the dialysis session. Subjects randomized to the SMC group (n = 259) received treatment determined by the investigator that could include oral iron, IV iron or no iron.
RESULTS: Single doses of FCM of 200 mg in HD-CKD patients and up to 1000 mg in NDD-CKD patients were well tolerated. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between the groups: 30.3% (77 of 254) in the FCM group and 32.8% (85 of 259) in the SMC group. Incidences of serious adverse events were higher in the SMC group overall and in patients receiving iron sucrose or sodium ferric gluconate. There were no clinically significant differences in laboratory or clinical chemistry values or vital signs between the groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the FCM and SMC groups in indices of hemoglobin (Hb) improvement, including proportions of patients achieving a ≥ 1 g/dL increase in Hb and proportions of patients achieving Hb level of >12 g/dL.

The aim of this study was to estimate the health care costs and benefits of parenteral iron compared with oral iron in haemodialysis patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).
METHODS: Using broad health care funder perspective, a probabilistic Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of parenteral iron therapy versus oral iron for the management of haemodialysis patients with relative iron deficiency. A series of one-way, multi-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model structure and the extent in which the model's assumptions were sensitive to the uncertainties within the input variables.
RESULTS: Compared with oral iron, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for parenteral iron were $74,760 per life year saved and $34,660 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses show that the ICER is most sensitive to the probability of achieving haemoglobin (Hb) targets using supplemental iron with a consequential decrease in the standard ESA doses and the relative increased risk in all-cause mortality associated with low Hb levels (Hb < 9.0 g/dL). If the willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $50,000/QALY, the proportions of simulations that showed parenteral iron was cost-effective compared with oral iron were over 90%.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that there is an overall increased mortality risk associated with very low Hb level (<9.0 g/dL), using parenteral iron to achieve an Hb target between 9.5 and 12 g/L is cost-effective compared with oral iron therapy among haemodialysis patients with relative iron deficiency.","2013",,"Nephrol Dial Transplant"," The aim of this study was to estimate the health care costs and benefits of parenteral iron compared with oral iron in haemodialysis patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) ","comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Since it has been reported that iron administration induces hypophosphatemic osteomalacia by triggering FGF23 synthesis, we hypothesized that iron administration might lead to a further increase in FGF23, resulting in alterations to Ca-P metabolism in a stage 5 CKD population.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in a single center, and involved 73 hemodialysis patients (47.7 ± 15.74 years old, 68.5% men), 29 peritoneal dialysis patients (44.55 ± 15.05 years old, 62.1% men), and 55 healthy (43.57 ± 14.36 years old, 55.6% men) subjects. The dialysis group was subcategorized according to iron therapy administration into users and nonusers.
RESULTS: The median iFGF23 level was significantly higher in the dialysis population than in the healthy controls [88.050 (25.2-1038.3) pg/ml versus 46.95 (2.4-356) pg/ml (p < 0.001)]. In the dialysis population, a significantly lower median iFGF23 level was observed in iron therapy users than in nonusers [87.6 (25.2-1038.3) versus 119 (51.6-1031); respectively, p = 0.045]. A significant negative association between iron administration and iFGF23 level was revealed by both univariate (r = -0.237, p = 0.016) and multivariate (β = -0.221, p = 0.032) analysis. No association was found between iFGF23 and serum ferritin and iron levels. Also, there was no association between iron therapy and serum phosphate level.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to what is seen for the general population, this study showed that there was a negative relationship between iron administration and serum iFGF23 level in a dialysis population. We can therefore conclude that if high levels of FGF23 are harmful, iron therapy may have a beneficial effect on bone metabolism by reducing FGF23 levels in a dialysis population.","2013",,"Clin Exp Nephrol",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Sysmex XE 5000 analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) reports reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He) and the percentages of erythrocyte subsets, including the hypochromic fraction (%Hypo-He). We study the value of these parameters of hemoglobinization in the evaluation of erythropoiesis and iron availability.
METHODS: Ninety healthy subjects, 85 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 65 patients on dialysis (HD) receiving therapy and 91 patients with iron deficiency (IDA) were analyzed. Pearson's correlation, t-test for independent, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were utilized.
RESULTS: The results in the IDA group reflected the state of iron depletion (low ferritin), low iron availability (low MCH and high percentage of hypochromic red cells (%Hypo-He)), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (low Ret-He). In the HD and CKD, the reticulocyte percentage showed the increased erythropoiesis, maintained due to treatment (Ret-He over 30 pg) and good iron availability, MCH within reference range and %Hypo-He slightly increased.

,"23230575","NULL",,"BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that develops early in the course of CKD, and becomes increasingly severe as the disease progresses. The management of anemia in CKD patients requires an appropriate balance between stimulating the generation of erythroblasts (erythropoiesis) and maintaining sufficient iron levels for optimum hemoglobin (Hb) production. Thus, assessing iron status is integral to both iron and anemia management in CKD patients, as iron is essential for Hb formation (as is erythropoietin). However, classical laboratory biomarkers of iron deficiency exhibit a wide biological variability in CKD. In response, newer, less-variable markers have been proposed.
PURPOSE: To summarize the literature on the use of newer versus classical laboratory biomarkers of iron status as part of the management strategies for iron deficiency in stages 3–5 CKD patients (nondialysis and dialysis).
DATA SOURCES: All published articles identified though MEDLINE
STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently selected studies on the basis of predetermined eligibility criteria. We considered studies of pediatric and adult nondialysis patients with stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD, patients with CKD undergoing dialysis (hemo- or peritoneal dialysis), and patients with a kidney transplant. Studies that compared newer laboratory biomarkers of interest such as hemoglobin content in reticulocytes (CHr), percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (%HYPO), erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID), with classical laboratory biomarkers, such as bone marrow iron stores, serum iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT), iron-binding capacity, and serum ferritin were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted article information into predesigned extraction forms; a second reviewer checked information for accuracy. A standardized protocol was used to extract details on designs, diagnoses, interventions, outcomes, and methodological issues.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 30 articles were accepted, including one Polish- and one Japanese-language publication. We did not identify any study that provided data directly addressing our overarching question (Key Question 1) regarding the impact of using newer laboratory biomarkers on patient-centered outcomes (mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and adverse effects). We identified 27 studies to answer Key Question 2, which addresses the performance of newer markers of iron status as a replacement for or in addition to classical markers. The synthesis of data for Key Question 2 was complicated by the lack of generally accepted reference standard tests for determining iron deficiency in the context of CKD. Of the 27 included studies, 15 used classical markers of iron status to define “iron deficiency” as the reference standard in calculating the test accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of newer markers of iron status. For the purpose of our review, this approach was analogous to assessing the concordance between classical and newer biomarkers of iron status; thus, these studies were only included for subquestion 2a (What reference standards are used for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in studies evaluating test performance?). The remaining 12 studies investigated the test performance of newer or classical markers of iron status, using a response to IV iron treatment as the reference standard for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. We therefore synthesized these 12 studies for Key Question 2. Of these 12 studies, most studies enrolled only adult CKD patients on hemodialysis (HD CKD patients), though a few examined adult peritoneal dialysis (PD) and nondialysis (ND) CKD patients. Only one study enrolled pediatric CKD patients. Although the reviewed studies evaluated many newer markers, such as CHr, %HYPO, RetHe, sTfR, hepcidin, and ZPP, the majority assessed CHr or %HYPO among adult HD CKD patients. Based on our analysis, we concluded that there is a low level of evidence that both CHr and %HYPO have a similar or better overall test accuracy compared with classical markers (TSAT or ferritin) to predict a response to IV iron treatment (as the reference standard for iron deficiency). In addition, data from a few studies suggest that CHr (with cutoff values of <27 or <28 pg) and %HYPO (with cutoff values of >6% or >10%) have better sensitivities and specificities to predict iron deficiency than classical markers (TSAT <20 or ferritin <100 ng/mL). There is also a low level of evidence that sTfR has a similar test performance compared with classical markers (TSAT or ferritin) to predict a response to IV iron treatment, but the strength of evidence was insufficient to come to a conclusion regarding the test performance of newer markers of iron status as an add-on to older markers, and that of ZPP and hepcidin. It should be noted that, across studies, there exists a high degree of heterogeneity in the test comparisons, definitions for the reference standard (a response to IV iron treatment), iron status of the study populations (assessed by TSAT or ferritin), and background treatment. This heterogeneity may limit the comparability of findings across studies. For Key Question 3 (impact on intermediate outcomes of newer markers compared with older markers), we identified only two short-term RCTs (4 and 6 months), enrolling a total of 354 adult HD CKD patients. We concluded that there is a low level of evidence for a reduction in the number of iron status tests and resulting intravenous iron treatments (a post hoc intermediate outcome) administered to patients whose iron management was guided by CHr compared with those guided by TSAT or ferritin. Both RCTs reported that Hct remained in the targeted ranges (an indication for the adequacy of anemia management) throughout the study period in all randomized arms, though the Hct target was higher in the U.S. trial than the Japanese trial. For Key Question 4 (factors affecting the test performance and clinical utility of newer markers), we included 3 studies (1 RCT and 2 prospective cohorts) as well as relevant data from all 27 studies included in Key Questions 2; however, we found insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions, as only single studies or indirect comparisons across studies provided relevant data.
LIMITATIONS: The available data are very limited due to a high degree of heterogeneity. There exist many definitions of a response to IV iron treatment as the reference standard for iron deficiency. Moreover, there is a lack of a uniform regimen of intravenous iron treatment in terms of dosage, iron formulation, treatment frequency, and followup duration for the iron challenge test (to define a response) across studies. Many studies included in our review were also rated as being at a high risk of bias, limiting their utility in informing clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining the evidence addressing Key Questions 2, 3, and 4, we can conclude that all currently available laboratory biomarkers of iron status (either newer or classical markers) do not have an ideal predictive ability when used singly to determine iron deficiency as defined by a response to iron challenge test. Furthermore, we can conclude that there is insufficient evidence to determine the test performance of the combinations of newer biomarkers, or combinations of newer and classical biomarkers, for diagnosing iron deficiency. However, it may be that CHr and %HYPO have better predictive ability for a response to IV iron treatment than classical markers (TSAT <20 or ferritin <100 ng/mL) in HD CKD patients. In addition, results from two RCTs showed a reduction in the number of iron status tests and resulting IV iron treatments administered to patients whose iron management was guided by CHr, compared with those guided by TSAT or ferritin. These results suggest that CHr may reduce potential harms from IV iron treatment by lowering the frequency of iron testing, although the evidence for the potential harms associated with testing or test-associated treatment is insufficient. Nevertheless, the strength of evidence supporting these conclusions is low, and there remains considerable clinical uncertainty regarding the use of newer markers in the assessment of iron status and management of iron deficiency in stages 3–5 CKD patients (both nondialysis and dialysis). In addition, factors that may affect the test performance and clinical utility of newer laboratory markers of iron status remain largely unexamined.","NULL",,"Biomarkers for Assessing and Managing Iron Deficiency Anemia in Late-Stage Chronic Kidney Disease"," PURPOSE : To summarize the literature on the use of newer versus classical laboratory biomarkers of iron status as part of the management strategies for iron deficiency in stages 3–5 CKD patients ( nondialysis and dialysis ) ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The majority of studies on anemia, inflammation, and disturbances of iron metabolism have focused on patients in end-stage renal failure and dialysis therapy. However, anemia and inflammation are present in patients in previous stages of renal failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of inflammatory activity on erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in CKD patients without dialytic treatment.
METHODS: 114 CKD adult patients were studied. Patients with anemia (n = 72) were compared with those without anemia (n = 46). Anemic patients were classified as renal anemia (n = 46) or iron deficiency anemia (n = 26). In addition the total group was analyzed according to the degree of renal dysfunction. Iron status, erythropoiesis activity (soluble transferrin receptor and erythropoietin determinations), and inflammatory activity (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-lp, and neopterin determinations) were measured using commercial kits. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-Y) was also determined.
RESULTS: Interleukin-6, interleukin-li, and neopterin concentrations were higher in the anemic group when compared with those without anemia and controls. There was no difference in C-reactive protein values between CKD with and without anemia, although both of them had showed elevated levels when compared with controls. Ret-Y values were lower in iron deficiency anemia when compared with renal anemia and controls. An inverse correlation between interleukin-6 and hemoglobin (r = -0.4287, p= 0.0002) was observed only in the renal anemia group. It was observed that anemia has a tendency to worsen as renal function deteriorates. Reticulocyte count was lower and neopterin concentrations were higher in more advanced renal failure stages.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory factors contribute to anemia in renal patients in all stages of renal failure. High levels of neopterin in CKD patients suggest that neopterin contributes to impaired erythropoietin production and anemia in CKD patients.","2012",,"Clin Lab"," The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of inflammatory activity on erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in CKD patients without dialytic treatment ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Service provision data were collected for 365 patients who received 600 mg IS within a 12 month period, creating the IS data set. The service provision data, along with a clinically relevant FCM administration protocol (stipulating total doses of 500 mg FCM), were used to calculate a corresponding theoretical data set for FCM for the same cohort of patients.
RESULTS: The FCM protocol saved each patient two hospital visits and 2.66 hours of time (equating to approximately a saving of £36.21 in loss of earnings) and £19 in travel costs. Direct attributable costs for iron administration (which included drug, disposables, nursing staff, and hospital-provided patient transport costs) were £58,646 for IS vs £46,473 for FCM. Direct overhead costs (which included nursing preparation time, administration staff, clinic space, and consultant time costs) were £40,172 for the IS service vs £15,174 for the FCM service.
LIMITATIONS: Based on clinical experience with the products, this analysis assumes that 500 mg FCM is therapeutically equivalent to 600 mg IS. Consultant time costs are assumed to be the same between the two treatment groups. IV iron administration protocols and data are specific to King's College Hospital. The design is retrospective and changes to the management of the clinic, including service delivery optimization, may also affect real costs.
CONCLUSION: FCM was associated with fewer hospital visits and reduced transport costs for CKD-ND patients receiving IV iron and has the potential to save 19-37% in service costs. Owing to increased administration efficiency, FCM can improve the overall patient experience while reducing the total cost of the King's College Hospital IV iron service for CKD-ND patients, compared with treatment with IS.","2013",,"J Med Econ",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Iron supplements are commonly prescribed for these patients with or without erythropoietin therapy by means of oral and intravenous iron. Both oral and intravenous irons have their own advantage and disadvantage, and the efficacy is also different. The objective of the study is to analyze the efficacy of oral and intravenous iron in chronic kidney disease patients on erythropoietin therapy, an erythropoiesis stimulating agents for increment of haemoglobin.
METHODS: This is a prospective study comparing intravenous iron to oral iron in chronic kidney disease patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis at different centers and visited Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital from April 2010 to April 2011. Patients having a haemoglobin level of < 11 g/dl, transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 25%, ferritin < 300ng/ml and who were on erythropoietin therapy were allocated alternately into two groups to receive oral iron (iron fumarate) or IV iron (iv sucrose). Haemoglobin was measured after 30 days of therapy.
RESULTS: A significant increase in haemoglobin levels was observed in both groups. But the mean haemoglobin increment was more in the IV iron group than in the oral iron group. Sixty percent 60% of patients in the IV iron group had an increase in the haemoglobin level of more than 1gm/dl while only 20% of the oral iron group had this increase.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron therapy is more effective in raising the hemoglobin level in hemodialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients.","2011",,"JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc"," The objective of the study is to analyze the efficacy of oral and intravenous iron in chronic kidney disease patients on erythropoietin therapy , an erythropoiesis stimulating agents for increment of haemoglobin ","clinical trial",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Activation of mineralocorticoid receptor signaling is implicated in CKD; however, a link between iron and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in CKD remains unknown. We have previously shown that long-term dietary iron restriction leads to increased sodium and decreased potassium excretions in the rat urine. Herein, we investigated the effect of iron restriction on renal damage and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in a rat model of CKD.
METHODS: CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in Sprague-Dawley rats. CKD rats were divided into untreated and dietary iron-restricted groups.
RESULTS: CKD rats exhibited proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitinal damage, and podocyte injury. In contrast, these changes were attenuated by 16 weeks of iron-restricted diet. Consistent with these findings, iron restriction suppressed increased gene expression of collagen type III, transforming growth factor-β, CD68, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the CKD kidney. Importantly, increased expression of nuclear mineralocorticoid receptor and SGK1, a key downstream effector of mineralocorticoid receptor signaling, in the CKD kidney was markedly attenuated by iron restriction. Of interest, expression of cellular iron transport proteins, transferrin receptor 1, and divalent metal transporter 1 was increased in the CKD renal tubules, along with increased iron accumulation, superoxide production, and urinary iron excretion. CKD rats also developed hypertension, although iron restriction suppressed the development of hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data uncover a novel effect of iron restriction on renal damage and hypertension through the inhibition of renal mineralocorticoid receptor signaling.","2012",,"J Hypertens"," OBJECTIVE : Iron is associated with the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

SUMMARY: Although erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are the mainstay of anemia treatment, concomitant iron supplementation is often required. Patients with CKD are at risk for developing iron deficiency due to frequent blood testing, decreased dietary intake, inflammation, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, the use of phosphate binders, hemodialysis, and treatment with ESAs. Seven randomized, controlled trials compared i.v. and oral iron in this population, six in patients treated with ESAs and one in patients not receiving ESAs. Two studies found no difference between i.v. and oral iron. An additional study found the two formulations to be equivalent when evaluating ESA dosage requirements. All studies found i.v. iron to be superior in increasing ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. Five of the studies compared baseline laboratory values for patients treated with i.v. and oral iron; all of these found oral iron to significantly increase hemoglobin, ferritin, or TSAT levels. Only one trial found a significant decrease from baseline in ferritin and TSAT for oral iron. Interpretation of the results of these studies is limited by several factors, the most significant of which is a short study duration, ranging from 21 days to six months.
CONCLUSION: Published evidence does not support the use of i.v. iron over oral iron to treat deficiencies in non-hemodialysis-dependent patients with CKD. While studies found that i.v. iron significantly increased serum levels of ferritin and TSAT, hemoglobin levels were not consistently raised.","2012",,"Am J Health Syst Pharm"," PURPOSE : The evidence evaluating the efficacy of i","comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Iron deficiency is the most important cause of erythropoietin (EPO) hyporesponsiveness in CKD. EPO administration significantly increases the costs of CKD management. It follows that paramount importance must be given to enhancing responsiveness to EPO thereby ensuring that the patient derives maximum benefit. Intravenous iron (IVI) administration has been used for decades to replenish body iron stores. Multiple preparations of Iron are available in the market. However, IVI administration is fraught with dangers like adverse drug reactions, susceptibility to infection, and, as recently postulated, direct cellular toxicity. Traditional approaches to IVI administration have focused on multiple administrations of lower doses for fear of adverse reactions. However, recent studies have demonstrated that higher doses can be safely administered in a single infusion, thereby reducing hospitalization costs and patient inconvenience. Newer preparations of IVI are relatively safer, easier to administer and efficacious. Preparations like Iron sucrose, ferumoxytol, ferric carboxymaltose and iron isomaltoside do not require test doses and allow higher doses to be administered at a time with cost and effect benefits.","2012",,"Contrib Nephrol",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

A clustered binomial logistic regression using the GEE methodology was used to identify predictors of IV iron utilization. Only 8% (n = 6678) of CKD patients on ESA therapy received IV iron supplementation in university hospitals. Those receiving iron used significantly less amounts of ESAs. Patient demographics (age, race, primary payer), patient clinical conditions (admission status, severity of illness, dialysis status), and physician specialty were identified as predictors of IV iron use in CKD patients. Use of IV iron with ESAs was low despite recommendations from consensus guidelines.

We postulated that elevated serum phosphate concentrations, present in CKD patients, might disrupt Fe(3+) loading into apo-transferrin by forming Fe(III)-phosphate species. We report that phosphate competes with apo-transferrin for Fe(3+) by forming a soluble Fe(III)-phosphate complex. Once formed, the Fe(III)-phosphate complex is not a substrate for donating Fe(3+) to apo-transferrin. Phosphate (1-10mM) does not chelate Fe(III) from diferric transferrin under the conditions examined. Complexed forms of Fe(3+), such as iron nitrilotriacetic acid (Fe(3+)-NTA), and Fe(III)-citrate are not susceptible to this phosphate complexation reaction and efficiently deliver Fe(3+) to apo-transferrin in the presence of phosphate. This reaction suggests that citrate might play an important role in protecting against Fe(III), phosphate interactions in vivo. In contrast to the reactions of Fe(3+) and phosphate, the addition of Fe(2+) to a solution of apo-transferrin and phosphate lead to rapid oxidation and deposition of Fe(3+) into apo-transferrin. These in vitro data suggest that, in principle, elevated phosphate concentrations can influence the ability of apo-transferrin to bind iron, depending on the oxidation state of the iron.","2012",,"J Inorg Biochem",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

METHODS: A randomized prospective study was conducted in 10 haemodialysis (HD) patients. Blood samples were collected at baseline (T0); 1 h after starting HD, just before the iron or saline administration (T1); 30 min after the iron or saline infusion (T2) and at the end of HD (T3). In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 10 healthy individuals and 9 chronic kidney disease Stage-5 (CKD-5) without HD treatment were cultured with the 4 iron preparations.
RESULTS: Iron infusion during the HD session increased the percentage of mononuclear cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and apoptosis. There were no significant differences between the four iron preparations. Culture of mononuclear cells from healthy individuals and CKD-5 patients with the different iron preparations resulted in a significant increase in ROS, ICAM-1 and apoptosis as compared with control. In an additional study, the effect of original iron sucrose formulation on mononuclear cells was compared with that of one generic formulation. The generic formulation produced a greater increase in ROS, ICAM-1 and apoptosis than the original iron sucrose.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that intravenous iron has deleterious effects on mononuclear cells. The four iron compounds evaluated produced similar effects on oxidative stress, cell activation and apoptosis. However, the effects of iron compounds with the same formulation were different, thus further investigation may be required to establish the safety of iron preparations that theoretically have the same composition.","2012",,"Nephrol Dial Transplant",,"randomized controlled trial",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Iron deficiency is more common than in normal patients and plays a key role in the genesis of anemia. Its correction avoids the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) or reduces their dosage. Treatment with oral iron is often poorly tolerated and ineffective, necessitating the use of intravenous iron. New forms of injectable iron allow the use of high doses and correct iron deficiency in a single administration with consequent preservation of venous capital and lower costs. We studied the effectiveness of iron dextran of low molecular weight (LMWID) in high doses to correct iron deficiency and treat anemia in predialysis CKD patients. Twenty-nine doses of 500 to 1600 mg were administered to 25 patients followed for CKD (GFR between 60 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), selected on biological criteria of iron deficiency defined by a ratio of transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20% and/or serum ferritin of less than 100 μg/L. Patients received treatment by ESA in 16 cases out of 29. One month after treatment, hemoglobin (Hb) increased significantly (11.4±1.6 vs 10.4±1.4 g/dL, P=0.0003) along with a significant increase in TSAT (21.3±7.3 vs 13.3±3.8%, P=0.000003) and serum ferritin (286±253 vs 91±60 μg/L, P=0.00005). Six patients had a serum ferritin greater than 500 μg/L after treatment, which may put them at risk of iron overload. Their serum ferritin was higher than the rest of the population before treatment, while the TSAT was no different, reflecting a functional deficiency. Their hemoglobin did not increase after treatment in contrast to the rest of the population suggesting the unavailability of iron for erythropoiesis with accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system. Renal function did not change significantly and there were no cases of acute renal failure. No immediate side effect was observed. Three patients presented delayed reactions to such self-limiting myalgia and arthralgia. No venous inflammatory reaction was noted. The administration of high doses of LMWID is effective in treating anemia of CKD in the predialysis stage with a satisfactory tolerance, without affecting kidney function and helps preserve the venous capital.

Several studies demonstrate that oral iron is insufficient in these patients and that IV supplementation is a more effective treatment. Until now, use of available parenteral iron preparations has been limited by dosing schedules and the need, in some cases, for a test dose, and despite the availability of a range of different IV iron compounds, there is still a need for improved compounds. The new IV iron, iron isomaltoside 1000 Monofer®, is composed of iron and chemically modified isomalto-oligosaccharides which have a mean molecular weight of 1000 Da and consist predominantly of 3-5 glucose units. In contrast to dextrans, the carbohydrate isomaltoside 1000 is a linear and unbranched structure with theoretically a low immunological potential. Hence, a test dose is not necessary. Iron isomaltoside 1000 contains strongly bound iron within the iron-isomaltoside formulation, which enables a controlled slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins, with potentially a reduced risk of free iron toxicity. This allows flexible dosing including high and rapid dosing securing convenient iron therapy for a wide range of patients. The development of Monofer® has been enthusiastically acknowledged by clinicians, and in 2009, there has been fast approval by European authorities via a decentralized registration procedure. This new IV iron is currently being marketed in several European countries. This article describes the development rationale and summarizes the clinical data assessing the use of iron isomaltoside 1000 administered without a test dose by either repeated bolus injections or fast high single iron infusions [defined as total dose infusion (TDI)] to patients suffering from CKD. Since CKD is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, data from a small trial applying high single doses of iron isomatoside 1000 in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are also reviewed. Collectively, the available data demonstrate adequate efficacy and a good safety profile of iron isomaltoside 1000 in CKD and CHF patients even when administered without a test dose and as single rapid high-dose infusions.","2011",,"NDT Plus",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

However, the safety of total dose infusion of LMW-ID has been investigated by only one study in chronic kidney disease (CKD) (not dialysis) patients. Thus, we aimed to compare adverse event profiles of total and high-dose LMW-ID and iron sucrose infusions in a heterogenous renal patient group comprising CKD, hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. In this retrospective chart review study, we included 110 predialysis CKD, 101 peritoneal dialysis, and 118 hemodialysis patients. We included a total of 329 patients who were administered parenteral iron sucrose or LMW-ID between September 2006 and April 2010. Adverse events were determined both by medical and nursing follow-up notes. Laboratory data and clinical characteristics were collected from patient charts. Adverse event rates were compared between iron sucrose and LMW-ID infusions. In a total of 329 patients, 530 infusions (3470 ampules) were administered. We detected adverse reaction in only 1 patient. This adverse reaction, which manifested as generalized pruritus, occurred in a patient who received 500 mg of iron sucrose infusion. There were neither anaphylactic reactions nor deaths associated with infusion of either preparation. We did not observe any other adverse event related to administration of 500 and 1000 mg of iron sucrose at single infusion.

METHODS: Anemic patients with nondialytic CKD who were naive to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were recruited for the prospective observational study. The participants were classified into oral iron or control group, and they were asked to keep their treatment status for 1 year. The primary outcomes were change in Hb and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RESULTS: A total of 182 participants were enrolled and 138 completed a 12-month follow-up. No change in Hb level was observed during the follow-up period in the iron group, whereas a significant decrease in Hb was observed in the control group. Oral iron supplementation was effective, especially in patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. The changes in eGFR did not differ between the two groups. The incidences of drug-related adverse events were equivalent in two groups.

,"21317036","Iron status and chronic kidney disease predict restless legs syndrome in an older hospital population.","Quinn C","BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is important in the pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome (RLS), and serum ferritin measurement, using a cutoff of 45-50ng/ml, is widely recommended as the optimal screening test for iron deficiency in RLS. Serum ferritin often increases with inflammation, and a higher cutoff may be better in those with acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, including those with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: The relationships between RLS and potential secondary causes were examined in hospital patients aged 50years or more. Diagnosis of RLS was based on a clinician interview.
RESULTS: Of 301 patients, 55 (18.3%) had RLS. Ferritin levels less than 40ng/ml and between 40 and 69ng/ml and Stage 4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] between 15 and 29ml/min and not on dialysis) were associated with significantly higher odds for RLS in univariate and multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: Iron deficiency and chronic kidney disease are the strongest predictors of RLS in older hospital patients. Ferritin less than 70ng/ml is the best cutoff for identifying possible iron deficiency in RLS patients with inflammatory conditions. Independent of iron status, RLS is strongly associated with chronic kidney disease that is not severe enough to require dialysis, and the results of this study suggest that eGFR values and stages of CKD should be reported in future studies of RLS.","2011",,"Sleep Med",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Iron stores are established and iron metabolism and erythropoiesis stabilise allowing haematinic parameters to be more confidently assessed for use in anaemia management decisions. High doses of IV iron delay the need for subsequent iron supplementation. A high-dose, low-frequency iron infusion regimen for all HD patients was adopted. The outcomes of administering this dosage regimen are reported as observational retrospective analysis using patient record data in 2009. Patients received three [median; semi-interquartile range (SIQR) 0.5] high-dose iron infusions during the year. The median infusion dose was 1100 mg iron (SIQR 0.0) and the median amount of iron received during the year by each patient was 3200 mg (SIQR 750). The median haemoglobin (Hb) level prior to infusion was 108 g/l and post infusion 114 g/l; ZHb = 2.656, p = 0.008). Ferritin levels increased from a median of 376 μg/l preinfusion to 690 μg/l postinfusion; Zferritin =-4.796, p < 0.001. The median time between infusions was 125 days (approximately four months). The 51 patients (76%) who received three or less infusions within the study period received 2537 mg (mean) of iron.

This study was designed to assess the safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer) in CKD patients. The secondary objective was to assess its effect on iron deficiency anemia.
METHODS: This open-label, noncomparative, multicenter trial assigned 182 patients with CKD (n=161 in dialysis and n=21 in predialysis) to iron isomaltoside 1000 either as 4 intravenous bolus injections of 100-200 mg iron per dose or as a fast high-dose infusion at baseline. Patients were generally undergoing erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment (82%), and the dosage was to be kept constant during the trial. They were either switched from an existing parenteral maintenance therapy (n=144) or were not currently being treated with parenteral iron (n=38). Frequency of adverse events (AEs) and changes in markers of iron deficiency anemia were measured during 8 weeks from baseline.
RESULTS: Nineteen treatment-related AEs occurred in 13 patients (7.1%) and after 584 treatments (3.3%). No anaphylactic or delayed allergic reactions were observed. There were no clinically significant changes in routine clinical laboratory tests or vital signs. Hemoglobin increased from 99.2 g/L (SD=9.0) at baseline to 111.2 g/L (SD=14.7) at week 8 in patients not currently treated with parenteral iron (p<0.001) and increased slightly or stabilized in patients in maintenance therapy.

RESULTS: Patients were followed for an average of 21.3 months (range 2-35) prior and 32.8 months (range 2-58) after the single iron infusion. Sixty-one percent of patients had CKD stage 3 and 30% were at CKD stage IV at the time of iron infusion.

,"21063931","Management of anemia and iron deficiency in heart failure.","O'Meara E","Anemia is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). The diagnosis of anemia should prompt assessment of the underlying cause(s), first by using routine laboratory measurements (i.e., serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, folic acid, and thyroid stimulating hormone). In clinical practice, it remains unclear whether using levels of the soluble transferrin receptor in HF patients to assess iron deficiency is warranted. Further investigation should follow these simple tests when judged appropriate (e.g., if occult gastrointestinal blood losses are suspected). Hemodilution may contribute significantly to anemia in patients with advanced HF and may be suspected when signs of hypervolemia are present. Euvolemia should be the first goal in such cases (as always), followed by optimization of the disease-modifying therapies used in HF (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, or aldosterone antagonists and cardiac resynchronization therapy in selected cases). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) can be used to improve functional capacity in patients with significant chronic kidney disease (CKD), a frequent comorbidity in HF patients. ESA and iron therapy is recommended in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), with a target hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL. In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, weekly administration of intravenous iron significantly improved symptoms, New York Heart Association class, quality of life, and exercise capacity in both anemic and non-anemic HF patients. A trend toward fewer hospitalizations was seen in the group treated with intravenous iron. The rates of adverse events were similar in the treatment and the placebo groups. Larger-scale and longer-term studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy profile of intravenous iron in non-CKD HF patients and in HF patients without anemia. Studies designed to further unravel the pathophysiology of anemia in HF are essential in order to determine 1) novel treatment targets and 2) whether and how the treatment of anemia could improve outcomes.","2010",,"Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Patients on hemodialysis have lower intestinal iron absorption, greater iron losses, and require greater iron turnover to maintain the ESA-driven red cell mass than do healthy individuals. In these patients, intravenous iron reduces ESA dose requirements and increases the likelihood of maintaining levels of hemoglobin within the desired range. Oral iron is inferior to intravenous iron in patients on hemodialysis, in part because elevated serum levels of hepcidin prevent intestinal absorption of iron. Increased levels of hepcidin also impair the normal recycling of iron through the reticuloendothelial system. Levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation below 450 pmol/l and 20%, respectively are indicative of iron deficiency, but values above the normal range lack diagnostic value in patients with CKD on dialysis.

Ferric carboxymaltose, a non-dextran parenteral iron preparation, can be rapidly administered in high doses.
METHODS: This open-label trial randomized 255 subjects with glomerular filtration rates ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), haemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL, transferrin saturation ≤ 25%, ferritin ≤ 300 ng/mL, and stable ESA dose to either intravenous ferric carboxymaltose 1000 mg over 15 min (with up to two additional doses of 500 mg at 2-week intervals) or oral ferrous sulphate 325 mg thrice daily for a total of 195 mg elemental iron daily for 56 days.
RESULTS: In the modified intent-to-treat population, the proportion of subjects achieving a haemoglobin increase ≥ 1 g/dL at any time was 60.4% with ferric carboxymaltose and 34.7% with oral iron (P < 0.001). At Day 42, mean increase in haemoglobin was 0.95 ± 1.12 vs 0.50 ± 1.23 g/dL (P = 0.005), mean increase in ferritin was 432 ± 189 ng/mL vs 18 ± 45 ng/mL (P < 0.001) and mean increase in transferrin saturation was 13.6 ± 11.9% vs 6.1 ± 8.1% (P < 0.001).

RESULTS: In predialysis patients, there was strong dose dependency between the administered Fe dose and changes in LIC at weeks 2 and 12; however, no dose dependency between Fe dose and changes in ferritin or transferrin saturation (TSAT) were observed. In hemodialysis patients, LIC correlated with the cumulative Fe dose and duration of dialysis but not with current ferritin or TSAT. The cumulative Fe dose remained a significant independent predictor of LIC in a multiple regression model. Two dialysis patients who received >6 g parenteral Fe had substantially elevated LIC >130 μmol/g, which is associated with hemochromatosis.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients with iron-deficiency anemia and CKD, stratified by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor-blocker (ARB) use, were randomized to iron sucrose or ferric gluconate. Each patient at 12 centers received 100 mg of study drug weekly for 5 weeks. Urine protein/urine creatinine ratio was measured before each dose and frequently thereafter for 3 hours.
RESULTS: Postbaseline data were available from 33 patients receiving iron sucrose and 29 patients receiving ferric gluconate. Although neither preparation of intravenous iron increased the predose level of proteinuria, the proteinuric response to intravenous iron was dependent on the type of iron and ACEI/ARB use. Without ACEIs/ARBs, ferric gluconate tended to cause less proteinuria with repeated iron administration; iron sucrose did not mitigate or aggravate proteinuria. Among patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs, in contrast to ferric gluconate, which produced only mild transient proteinuria, iron sucrose produced a consistent and persistent proteinuric response that was on average 78% greater.
CONCLUSIONS: Although multiple doses of either intravenous iron did not increase basal levels of proteinuria, postdose proteinuria was greater with iron sucrose than with ferric gluconate.

Iron therapy is recommended, usually in combination with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), in many CKD patients with anemia and low iron levels to raise hemoglobin levels to a range of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter; iron deficiency is defined by a ferritin score less than 100 micrograms (mcg) per liter and transferrin saturation (TSAT) less than 20%.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of intravenous (IV) iron and its associated economic and clinical outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with stage 3 or stage 4 CKD and anemia.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis using 2006 and 2007 Medicare 5% Standard Analytic Files (SAF). Use of therapy with IV iron and/or ESAs was identified among patients diagnosed with CKD and anemia. The study index quarter was the first quarter in 2006 during which the patient had primary or secondary diagnoses of both CKD and anemia. Based on the receipt of IV iron or ESA treatment in the index quarter, patients were classified into 1 of 4 treatment groups: IV iron and ESA; IV iron without ESA; ESA without IV iron; neither IV iron nor ESA. Therapy with oral iron was not measurable with this database. Clinical and economic outcomes, including the progression to advanced CKD stages, development of anemia, mortality, hospitalization, and net Medicare reimbursement (i.e., not including patient or supplemental plan contribution) for all-cause health care services, were examined for 1 year following the index quarter. Between-group differences were tested using Pearson chi-square for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test for reimbursement. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to assess the associations of mortality, inpatient hospitalization, skilled nursing facility (SNF) admission, and hospice care with treatment regimen, controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Of the 4,310 study patients with both CKD and anemia, 2,913 (67.6%) received neither IV iron nor ESA; 984 (22.8%) received ESA without IV iron; 277 (6.4%) received IV iron and ESA; and 136 (3.2%) received IV iron without ESA in the index quarter. Logistic regression analyses showed that patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA (reference group) were at increased risk of death compared with patients receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.42-0.90). Additionally, patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA were more likely to be hospitalized compared with patients receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50-0.87), IV iron without ESA (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38-0.79), and ESA without IV iron (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.62-0.87). Further, patients not receiving IV iron or ESA were more likely to be admitted to an SNF than patients receiving both IV iron and ESA (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.32-0.61), IV iron without ESA (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.36-0.88), and ESA without IV iron (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.47-0.67). Patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA in the index quarter had the highest mean [SD] total Medicare reimbursement per patient in the subsequent year ($42,353 [$52,887]) compared with patients receiving IV iron without ESA ($28,654 [$32,068]), IV iron and ESA ($34,152 [$30,506]), or ESA without IV iron ($38,172 [$35,591], P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Use rates of IV iron and ESA in a sample of Medicare enrollees with CKD and anemia in 2006 suggest that anemia management therapies may be underutilized; however, oral iron therapy use was not measurable with the study database, and therapies initiated after the index quarter were not measured. Patients not treated with IV iron or ESA had significantly higher rates of hospitalization and SNF admission than patients treated with either IV iron or ESA. Further, mortality was significantly higher in patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA than in patients who received IV iron and ESA. Additionally, total all-cause health care costs were higher among patients receiving neither IV iron nor ESA treatment compared with patients treated with IV iron and/or ESA.","2010",,"J Manag Care Pharm"," OBJECTIVE : To examine the use of intravenous ( IV ) iron and its associated economic and clinical outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with stage 3 or stage 4 CKD and anemia ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The most common causes of the anemia in CHF are (1) the associated Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes depression of erythropoietin (EPO) production in the kidney, and (2) excessive cytokine production in CHF, which can cause both depression of erythropoietin production in the kidney and depression of erythropoietin response in the bone marrow. The cytokines can also induce iron deficiency by increasing hepcidin production from the liver, which both reduces gastrointestinal iron absorption and reduces iron release from iron stores located in the macrophages and hepatocytes. It appears that iron deficiency is very common in CHF and is rarely recognized or treated. The iron deficiency can cause a thrombocytosis that might contribute to cardiovascular complications in both CHF and CKD and is reversible with iron treatment. Thus, attempts to control this anemia in CHF will have to take into consideration both the use of both Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) such as EPO and oral and, probably more importantly, intravenous (IV) iron. Many studies of anemia in CHF with ESA and oral or IV iron and even with IV iron without ESA have shown a positive effect on hospitalization, New York Heart Association functional class, cardiac and renal function, quality of life, exercise capacity and reduced Beta Natriuretic Peptide and have not demonstrated an increase in cardiovascular damage related to the therapy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage IIIB or IV undergoing intravenous iron (group A) and/or ESA (group B). Full blood profiles were determined over the study period. Glycemic control was monitored using A1C, seven-point daily glucose three times weekly, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).
RESULTS: There were 15 patients in both group A and group B. Mean A1C (95% CI) values fell in both groups (7.40% [6.60-8.19] to 6.96% [6.27-7.25], P<0.01, with intravenous iron and 7.31% [6.42-8.54] to 6.63% [6.03-7.36], P=0.013, ESA).

In most trials, patients received either FCM doses of < or = 1000 mg, administered intravenously (i.v.) over < or = 15 min. or oral ferrous sulfate (FeSulf) 325 mg (65 mg iron), three times daily (t.i.d.), or 304 mg (100 mg iron), twice daily (b.i.d.). In one trial, patients on HD received 200 mg i.v. of either FCM or iron sucrose (ISC), two-to-three times weekly. In a pilot study in patients with CHF and CKD, patients received 200 mg of FCM by push injection compared with 200 mg of ISC slow injection. FCM was usually administered until the patient's calculated total iron replacement dose was achieved. Treatment with FCM improved indices of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb], ferritin and transferrin saturation [TSAT] values). In patients on HD with IDA secondary to CKD, FCM demonstrated comparable efficacy to ISC in achieving an increase in Hb. In patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than with FeSulf. Patients with PPA receiving FCM compared with those receiving oral iron achieved an Hb rise > or = 2.0 g/dl earlier (7 days compared with 14 days; p < 0.001), were more likely to achieve an Hb rise > or = 3.0 g/dl at any time beginning at day 14 (86.3% compared with 60.4%; p < 0.001), and achieve an Hb > 12.0 g/dl at the end of the study (Day 42; 90.5% compared with 68.6%, p < 0.01). Serum ferritin increased in the i.v. FCM treatment group, but not in the oral iron group. Differences between groups were significant at each study interval. TSAT increased significantly at every interval in both groups; however, FCM-treated patients showed higher TSAT at each interval after the first week. FCM improved patient quality of life to an equivalent extent to oral FeSulf in patients with IBD or PPA, and to a greater extent than oral FeSulf in women with AUB. FCM also improved quality of life as well as functional symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with CHF. Safety data from more than 3000 patients showed that FCM was well tolerated. No safety concerns have been identified in breastfed infants of mothers receiving FCM. FCM is, therefore, an effective and well-tolerated option in the treatment of IDA.","2010",,"Arzneimittelforschung",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol were assessed in three randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials. Two trials evaluated patients with nondialysis dependent CKD and a third trial assessed patients undergoing hemodialysis. Randomization was either to ferumoxytol or oral iron. Ferumoxytol was administered as two 510 mg IV injections, separated by 3-8 days. Oral iron, Ferro-Sequels, was administered at a dose of 100 mg twice daily for 21 days. In all three clinical trials, ferumoxytol administration increased the mean blood hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations by approximately 1.0 g/dL over the 35 day period, a mean increase that was greater than what was observed in patients receiving oral iron. Patients receiving ferumoxytol also had increases in blood transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin values. For the proposed ferumoxytol dosing regimen, 4.9% of patients had serum ferritin >or=800 ng/mL and TSAT >or=50% post-treatment. The most important ferumoxytol safety concerns were hypersensitivity reactions and/or hypotension. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions were reported in 0.2% of subjects, and other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria, or wheezing) were reported in 3.7%. Hypotension was observed in 1.9%, including three patients with serious hypotensive reactions.

We examined the diagnostic utility of peripheral-iron indices and the erythropoietic response to intravenous iron as indices of iron store depletion using bone marrow iron as a reference test in anemic non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD.
STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic test study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 100 anemic (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) patients with CKD stages 3-5, not receiving epoetin and iron.
INDEX TESTS: TSAT index and serum ferritin level at baseline and increase in hemoglobin level 1 month after 200 mg of iron sucrose daily for 5 days.
REFERENCE TEST: Bone marrow iron (assessed using aspiration and Perls' stain), depleted versus replete, at baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity of peripheral-iron indices and erythropoietic response to describe bone marrow iron stores.
RESULTS: Bone marrow iron stores were depleted in 48% of patients at baseline. In iron-depleted versus -replete subjects, mean hemoglobin level, median TSAT index, median serum ferritin level, and hemoglobin level increase after iron sucrose administration were 8.74 +/- 1.1 (SD) versus 9.22 +/- 0.9 g/dL (P = 0.02), 19% (interquartile range [IQR], 15%) versus 28% (IQR, 12%; P < 0.001), 100 (IQR, 131) versus 220 ng/mL (IQR, 213; P < 0.001), and 1.2 +/- 0.4 versus 0.8 +/- 0.3 g/dL (P < 0.001), respectively.

LIMITATIONS: Bone marrow iron as the index of iron stores.
CONCLUSIONS: Half the anemic patients with CKD stages 3-5 had depleted iron stores.

Because little free iron is present in the preparation, doses of 510 mg have been administered safely in as little as 17 seconds. Two prospective, randomized studies compared two doses of ferumoxytol 510 mg given in 5 +/- 3 days with 3 weeks of oral iron 200 mg/day (as ferrous fumarate) in anemic patients with CKD. One study enrolled 304 patients with stages 1-5 CKD (predialysis), and the other study enrolled 230 patients with stage 5D CKD (undergoing hemodialysis). In both studies, a greater increase in hemoglobin level from baseline to end of study (day 35) was noted in patients who received ferumoxytol compared with those who received oral iron (mean +/- SD 0.82 +/- 1.24 vs 0.16 +/- 1.02 g/dl in patients with stages 1-5 CKD and 1.02 +/- 1.13 vs 0.46 +/- 1.06 g/dl in patients with stage 5D CKD, p<0.001). A greater proportion of both predialysis and hemodialysis patients who received ferumoxytol had hemoglobin level increases from baseline of 1 g/dl or more compared with those who received oral iron (p<0.001). In a prospective, double-blind, crossover study of more than 700 patients with CKD stages 1-5D that compared the safety of ferumoxytol with normal saline injection, the rates of treatment-related adverse events were 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively. Serious treatment-related adverse events were seen in one patient in each treatment group. The most common adverse events with ferumoxytol occurred at the injection site (bruising, pain, swelling, erythema). Dizziness, nausea, pruritus, headache, and fatigue occurred in less than 2% of patients receiving ferumoxytol, with a similar frequency noted after administration of normal saline. In short-term studies, intravenous ferumoxytol was safely and rapidly administered, and was more effective than oral iron therapy in increasing hemoglobin levels in anemic patients with CKD.

We investigated the accuracy of peripheral and central iron indices to predict the response to intravenous iron in nondialysis patients with CKD and anemia.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A diagnostic study was conducted on 100 nondialysis patients who had CKD and anemia and were erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and iron naive. Bone marrow iron stores were evaluated by aspiration. Hemoglobin, transferrin saturation index (TSAT), and ferritin were measured at baseline and 1 month after 1000 mg of intravenous iron sucrose. Posttest predictive values for the erythropoietic response (> or =1-g/dl increase in hemoglobin) of peripheral and central iron indices were calculated.
RESULTS: The erythropoietic response was noted in a higher proportion in bone marrow iron-deplete than in iron-replete patients (63 versus 30%). Peripheral iron indices had a moderate accuracy in predicting response. The positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were 76 and 72% for a TSAT of 15% and 74 and 70% for a ferritin of 75 ng/ml, respectively. In the final logistic regression model, including TSAT and ferritin, the chances of a positive response increased by 7% for each 1% decrease in TSAT.
CONCLUSIONS: Because an erythropoietic response is seen in half of patients and even one third of those with iron-replete stores responded whereas peripheral indices had only a moderate utility in predicting response, the therapeutic trial to intravenous iron seems to be a useful tool in the management of anemia in nondialysis patients with CKD.","2010",,"Clin J Am Soc Nephrol","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Anemia is iron responsive in 30 to 50 % of nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , but the utility of bone marrow iron stores and peripheral iron indices to predict the erythropoietic response is not settled ","other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

METHODS: A PubMed search from 1970 to February 2009 was conducted to identify relevant research articles.
FINDINGS: Iron supplementation is advisable for all iron-deficient CKD patients receiving erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), and intravenous iron may be preferable to oral iron. However, there is also a growing body of data indicating that iron supplementation may avoid or delay the need for ESA therapy in some ND-CKD patients. In each of four randomised trials that included ND-CKD patients without ESA, the haemoglobin response was greater with i.v. versus oral iron. Moreover, some ND-CKD patients who remain anaemic on oral iron may subsequently respond to i.v. iron. Newer preparations (ferric carboxymaltose and ferumoxytol) permit rapid, high-dose administration. In a randomised study, a single 15-minute injection of ferric carboxymaltose, with up to two additional doses as required, resulted in 53.2% of ND-CKD patients achieving > or =1 g/dL increase in haemoglobin by day 56 without ESA, compared to 29.9% of patients given oral iron supplements. Two large, randomised, ongoing trials will address the important question of whether i.v. or oral iron supplementation affects the progression of renal dysfunction. While i.v. iron is more costly than oral iron, the cost differential over time may be lower than widely believed, and i.v. therapy avoids the poor absorption, gastrointestinal intolerance and non-compliance associated with oral preparations. In terms of safety, true anaphylaxis does not occur with modern preparations such as iron sucrose and iron gluconate. The novel preparations ferric carboxymaltose and ferumoxytol do not require a test dose and appear to offer a good safety profile, but long-term safety monitoring is mandatory.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous iron offers an effective, feasible route towards reducing the heavy burden of iron-deficiency anaemia in the non-dialysis CKD patient, even in the absence of ESA therapy.","2010",,"Curr Med Res Opin",,"comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The increase in the number of referrals to renal services since the introduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting in 2006 in England means that people with CKD are being identified earlier and consequently, complications such as anaemia are being highlighted sooner. The prevalence of anaemia of CKD has been estimated in a population study of stage 3-5 CKD as 4.5% (John et al. 2004). People with stage 3 CKD and diabetes have a 22% incidence of anaemia that is much greater than the incidence of 7.9% in those without diabetes (El Achkar et al. 2005). The increase in numbers requiring anaemia management is having an impact on resources and service provision, in particular the treatment of iron deficiency with IV iron. A need to be creative and investigate alternative ways of using resources and providing services in different settings was identified by the multiprofessional members of the Anaemia Nurse Specialist Association (ANSA) and the CKD forum (a project group of the British Renal Society). The outcome has been the production of a practical guide for healthcare professionals to assist with the development of IV iron services in a nonacute hospital setting.

The advent of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) has revolutionised the therapy of anaemia of CKD, and has resulted in a significant decline in the need for blood transfusions in CKD patients. The routine application of ESA has also led to the need for concomitant iron supplementation. ESA and iron therapy now form the cornerstone of anaemia management in CKD. Intravenous iron administration is effective with acceptable safety, and may improve ESA responsiveness. However, less is known about the long-term safety of iron supplementation in CKD patients. Whereas maintenance (weekly to monthly) intravenous iron has been routinely used in maintenance dialysis patients, iron replacement in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD is less well studied, in spite of the much larger number of patients affected.

Since parenteral iron was first introduced for human use in the 1930s, things have come a long way. Seventy years ago, iron was toxic, administered as an iron oxyhydroxide complex. This problem was circumvented with the introduction of compounds containing iron in a core surrounded by a carbohydrate shell. The carbohydrate shell consists of molecules such as dextran, sucrose, dextrin or gluconate. The first dextran-containing IV iron preparations carried a small risk of anaphylaxis, but the more recently introduced low molecular weight iron dextran preparation has significantly less risk of this. Iron reactions occur with all IV iron preparations, but are generally not thought to be immune based. Recently, newer IV iron preparations have appeared in the market, including Ferumoxytol (Feraheme) and ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject). These latest IV iron preparations do not contain a requirement for a test dose, and a much higher dose of iron can be delivered as a single administration. Thus, giving supplemental iron to man has come a long way since 1930s; we are now in an era when we are able to administer higher doses of iron with acceptable safety and without significant adverse effects. However, the long-term safety of the newer IV iron preparations is not yet established.","2009",,"J Ren Care",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Normal patient (n=47) samples were collected and assayed for hepcidin to determine a reference range. Other patient groups collected were ulcerative colitis (UC; n=40), iron deficiency anaemia (IDA; n=15), chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis (CKD; n=45) and chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis (HCKD; n=94). Detection limit of the assay was determined as 0.6 ng/mL. Intra-assay precision was 5 ng/mL (7.2%) and 50 ng/mL (5.8%), interassay precision was 5 ng/mL (7.6%) and 50 ng/mL (6.7%). Analytical recovery was 98% (5 ng/mL), 94% (10 ng/mL) and 97% (50 ng/mL). The assay was linear up to 200 ng/mL. No demonstrable cross-reactivity with human insulin, glucagon I, angiotensinogen I, beta-defensin 1-4, alpha-defensin-1 and plectasin was observed. There was significant correlation (r=0.96, P < or = 0.0001) between the hepcidin RIA and an established hepcidin SELDI-TOF-MS method. Analysis of the normal human samples gave a reference range of 1.1-55 ng/mL for hepcidin. Further statistical evaluation revealed a significant difference between male and female hepcidin levels.

Intravenous iron is more effective and can raise levels of hemoglobin even without the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Unfortunately, the current assays of iron status that are presently widely available are not especially helpful in predicting response. In patients on dialysis, i.v. iron is effective over a wide range of serum ferritin from <100 ng/ml to 800 ng/ml. None of the three available randomized controlled trials comparing oral with i.v. iron showed evidence of nephrotoxicity caused by i.v. iron. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for thrombocytosis and should, wherever possible, be avoided. Optimal coadministration of iron may reduce the risk for ESA-driven cardiovascular events. Increased total body iron stores (imperfectly reflected by serum ferritin levels in CKD) do not appear to be related to such events or hospitalization in CKD; it is unclear what other risk factors and mechanisms need to be considered. In the appreciable proportion of patients with both renal and cardiac dysfunction, management is further complicated by a vicious circle (which can be characterized as cardiorenal anemia syndrome) in which CKD, heart failure, and anemia exacerbate each other. In such patients, correction of anemia appears to improve cardiac function and quality of life without a greater risk for adverse events.","2009",,"Oncologist",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

This article reviews the structure, pharmacokinetics, and clinical trial results on ferumoxytol. The author also offers his opinions on the role of this product in clinical practice.
METHODS: This review encompasses important information contained in clinical and preclinical studies of ferumoxytol and is supplemented with information from the US Food and Drug Administration.
RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Ferumoxytol offers substantial safety and superior efficacy compared with oral iron therapy. As ferumoxytol can be administered as 510 mg in < 1 min, it is substantially more convenient than other iron products in nondialysis patients. Although further experience with this product is needed in patients at higher risk of drug reactions, ferumoxytol is likely to be highly useful in the hospital and outpatient settings for treatment of IDA.","2009",,"Expert Opin Pharmacother"," OBJECTIVE : Ferumoxytol ( Feraheme ) is a new i"," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TDI CosmoFer in comparison to intravenous iron sucrose infusion (Venofer) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study of outpatients with CKD undergoing intravenous TDI CosmoFer or Venofer infusion was conducted at Salford Royal Hospital and Sunderland Royal Hospital. A total of 979 doses of CosmoFer and 504 doses of Venofer were administered. There were three minor adverse events in patients receiving CosmoFer compared with one minor event in a Venofer treated patient. There were no anaphylactoid-type reactions in either group. Serum haemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) improved significantly 4-6 months postinfusion in both treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: TDI CosmoFer is an efficacious method of replenishing iron stores in CKD patients in an outpatient setting. Furthermore, TDI CosmoFer is safe and not associated with an increase in adverse events compared to Venofer.","2009",,"J Ren Care"," This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TDI CosmoFer in comparison to intravenous iron sucrose infusion ( Venofer ) in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ","comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Erythropoietin is a hormone synthesized that is deficient in the majority of patients with advanced kidney disease, thereby predisposing these patients to anemia. The other cause of anemia is deficiency of iron. Iron deficiency anemia is common in people with CKD and its importance in supporting erythropoiesis is unquestioned, especially in those patients treated with erythropoietin. Intravenous iron is frequently used to treat anemia in CKD patients and is very efficacious in increasing hemoglobin but at the same time there are some safety issues associated with it. The objective of this review is to assess the frequency of adverse drug events associated with four different iron formulations: two iron dextran products known as high and low molecular weight iron dextran, iron sucrose, and sodium ferric gluconate complex. Several electronic databases were searched. In general, with the exception of high molecular weight iron dextran, serious or life-threatening adverse events appeared rare. Iron sucrose has the least reported adverse events and high molecular weight iron dextran has the highest number of reported adverse events. Low molecular weight iron dextran and ferric gluconate fall in between these two for number of adverse drug events.","2008",,"Clin Med Res"," The objective of this review is to assess the frequency of adverse drug events associated with four different iron formulations : two iron dextran products known as high and low molecular weight iron dextran , iron sucrose , and sodium ferric gluconate complex "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"19233073","Intravenous iron versus erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: friends or foes in treating chronic kidney disease anemia?","Kalantar-Zadeh K","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those requiring maintenance hemodialysis treatments, may lose up to 3 g of iron each year because of frequent blood losses. Higher doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may worsen iron depletion and lead to an increased platelet count (thrombocytosis), ESA hyporesponsiveness, and hemoglobin variability. Hence, ESA therapy requires concurrent iron supplementation. Traditional iron markers such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation ratio (TSAT) (ie, serum iron divided by total iron-binding capacity [TIBC]), may be confounded by non-iron-related conditions. Whereas serum ferritin <200 ng/mL suggests iron deficiency in CKD patients, ferritin levels between 200 and 1,200 ng/mL may be related to inflammation, latent infections, malignancies, or liver disease. Protein-energy wasting may lower TIBC, leading to a TSAT within the normal range, even when iron deficiency is present. Iron and anemia indices have different mortality predictabilities, in that high serum ferritin but low iron, TIBC, and TSAT levels are associated with increased mortality, whereas hemoglobin exhibits a U-shaped risk for death. The increased mortality associated with targeting hemoglobin above 13 g/dL may result from iron depletion-associated thrombocytosis. Intravenous (IV) iron administration may not only decrease hemoglobin variability and ESA hyporesponsiveness, it may also reduce the greater mortality associated with the much higher ESA doses that have been used in some patients when targeting higher hemoglobin levels.","2009",,"Adv Chronic Kidney Dis",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

Ferumoxytol is a unique intravenous iron product that can be administered as a rapid injection in doses up to 510 mg.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter Phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous ferumoxytol compared with oral iron. Anemic patients with CKD stage 5D on hemodialysis and on a stable erythropoiesis-stimulating agent regimen received either two injections of 510 mg of ferumoxytol within 7 d (n = 114) or 200 mg elemental oral iron daily for 21 d (n = 116). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to day 35. Safety was closely monitored.
RESULTS: Ferumoxytol resulted in a mean increase in hemoglobin of 1.02 +/- 1.13 g/dl at day 35 compared with 0.46 +/- 1.06 g/dl with oral iron (P = 0.0002). Twice as many ferumoxytol-treated patients than oral iron-treated patients achieved a > or =1 g/dl hemoglobin increase at day 35 (P = 0.0002).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between CHr and %HYPO parameters and the reticulocyte haemoglobin equivalent (RET-He) and red blood cell haemoglobin equivalent (RBC-He) calculated by the Sysmex XE-2100 haematology analyser in a cohort of 200 dialysis patients referred to the Nephrology Unit of our hospital. Furthermore, we evaluated a new index, the DF-Hypo XE, obtained from haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct) and RET-He, provided by the Sysmex XE-2100, as a new potential marker of %HYPO in dialysed patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples collected in EDTA anticoagulant from 200 CKD patients receiving erythropoietin and iron to maintain haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 mg/dL were analysed on both the Siemens ADVIA 2120 and the Sysmex XE-2100 within 2 h of collection.
RESULTS: There was good correlation between CHr and RET-He (r = 0.88; p<0.0001), %HYPO and DF-Hypo XE (r = 0.89; p<0.0001) and between RBC-He and CH (r = 0.96; p<0.0001), but there was a lower correlation, even though statistically significant, between RBC-He and %HYPO (r = -0.59; p<0.0001).

SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD (stages III to V). We included dialysis patients and patients with CKD not on dialysis therapy (hereafter referred to as patients with CKD).
SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: We included all randomized controlled trials regardless of publication status or language.
INTERVENTION: Intravenous (IV) versus oral iron supplementation.
OUTCOMES MEASURES: Primary outcomes assessed: absolute hemoglobin (Hb) level or change in Hb level from baseline. We also assessed all-cause mortality, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent requirement, adverse events, ferritin level, and need for renal replacement therapy in patients with CKD.
RESULTS: 13 trials were identified, 6 including patients with CKD and 7 including dialysis patients. Compared with oral iron, there was a significantly greater Hb level in dialysis patients treated with IV iron (weighted mean difference, 0.83 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 1.57).

Oral iron is insufficient, while intravenous (IV) supplementation replenishes and maintains iron stores. In Yorkshire numerous peripheral clinics exist to reduce travel for patients, but patients must travel to the main unit for IV iron therapy. Therefore an outpatient service in tandem with a routine clinic for administration of IV CosmoFer was created.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and benefits of IV iron therapy in the outpatient clinic during active patient review for CKD patients.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of patients attending for total dose IV iron (n = 57) at a peripheral clinic. Iron was administered and monitored according to protocol by one of the clinic nurses with medical staff available in the adjoining room. Haemoglobin, ferritin and renal function were recorded pre-infusion and after 4-6 months. Results are given as medians/means +/- standard error.
RESULTS: A total of 76 IV infusions were carried out with no reported side effects or haemodynamic instability. Haemoglobin (median 10.9 vs. 11.3 g dL(-1), P = NS), creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over the 6-month period remained stable. Serum ferritin rose significantly [80.9 +/- 6.2 vs. 186.4 +/- 18.2 g L(-1) (P < 0.001)].

During long-term rHuEpo treatment most patients develop and show persistent iron deficiency in spite of oral iron supplementation. Abnormalities of iron absorption and transport in the duodenum may contribute to this deficiency.
METHODS: To investigate changes in iron absorption and transport in CKD and iron deficiency against the background of rHuEpo treatment, we used severely anaemic rats with adenine-induced renal failure (adenine rats) and sham-treated control rats given only the vehicle. After 4 weeks on adenine or the vehicle, the rats were divided into four groups according to whether or not they received rHuEpo for the next 4 weeks: rHuEpo(-)-adenine, rHuEpo(-)-control, rHuEpo(+)-adenine and rHuEpo(+)-control. We evaluated the effects of rHuEpo treatment on iron balance, duodenal mRNA expression of molecules related to iron absorption and transport and hepatic mRNA expression of hepcidin.
RESULTS: Treatment with rHuEpo improved anaemia and induced iron deficiency only in the adenine rats, in whom the expression of mRNAs for ferroportin 1 and hephaestin 1 increased and for divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) was unchanged. In contrast, control rats treated with rHuEpo showed no changes. Hepcidin mRNA expression was greater in adenine rats than in control rats.

The need for iron supplementation in CKD patients becomes obvious. Intravenous iron was demonstrated to be superior to oral iron in hemodialysis patients. There is also evidence for the superiority of intravenous iron in peritoneal dialysis and in nondialysis-dependent CKD patients. On the other hand, intravenous iron could promote cytotoxicity and tissue injury, and exacerbate oxidative stress and thus endothelial dysfunction, as well as inflammation and the progression of both CKD and cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, correction of anemia is effective in reducing oxidative stress and, consequently, cardiovascular risk.

Iron deficiency in patients with CKD (serum ferritin concentration below 100 ng/ml, transferrin saturation below 20%) occurs in 20-70% of cases. Prevalence of iron deficiency depends on stage of CKD and patients' gender. Among causes of iron deficiency the following reasons are mentioned: blood loss through gastrointestinal tract (17-18% of patients in pre-dialysis stage show positive results of tests on occult blood), diminished absorption (uremic gastroenteropathy, administration of drugs decreasing iron absorption), decreased delivery of food (anorexia, low protein diet), infections and inflammatory state. In the course of infections and inflammatory states body iron storage may be normal, but its utilization for erythropoesis is deteriorated (functional iron deficiency). Results of randomized controlled studies indicate greater efficiency of intravenous therapy in comparison with oral route of iron administration. In practice, the main route of administration of iron-containing drugs to non-dialyzed patients with CKD remains, however, the oral one (iron sulfate, iron fumarate, hem iron) as more convenient and seldom leading to serious side effects. Intravenous iron therapy (iron dextrose, iron polymaltose, sodium-iron gluconate, iron sucrose) is required for cases with absolute deficiency of this microelement, disturbed intestinal absorption, poor tolerance of oral iron medication or its ineffectiveness from other reasons. Administration of erythropoiesis stimulating agents in predialysis period may require intravenous iron therapy because of enhanced consumption of its stores for erythropoiesis.

The venous supplementation of iron offers today the best safety/efficacy profile. The evaluation of iron store is mandatory in CKD patient. The assessment of iron store in kidney patient relies on three major markers: transferrin saturation (Trf Sat); ferritin; percentage of hypochromic erythroid cells. Faced to iron deficiency, it is crucial to differentiate two situations: an absolute iron deficiency (Trf Sat < 20 % ; ferritin < 100 ng/ml; percentage of hypochromic cells > 10%); a functional iron deficiency (Trf Sat < 20%; ferritin > 200-500 ng/ml; percentage of hypochromic cells > 5-10%).

Correction of anemia in CKD patients includes the administration of both recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron. An optimization of iron treatment requires obtaining a target hemoglobin level and avoiding an excessive body-iron overload. The reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) has been shown to be an early indicator of iron-restricted erythropoiesis. The recent European guidelines for anemia treatment in CKD assessed the value for CHr >29 pg/cell as the reticulocyte parameter to evaluate a patient's iron needs. The reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (RET-He), recently introduced to determine the forward scatter of fluorescence-labeled reticulocytes, seems to be a sensitive indicator of iron-deficiency anemia. This study evaluates the concordance between the CHr parameter, used as a reference, and the new RET-He in a cohort of 57 dialysis patients referred to the Nephrology Unit of our hospital. All patients received erythropoietin, and iron was administered intravenously to maintain the hemoglobin level between 10 and 12 mg/dL. A total of 285 determinations were performed with both instruments. In the dialysis population, the 95% central range for CHr of 24.8 to 36.3 pg corresponds to a range for RET-He of 23.3 to 40.1 pg, with a mean bias of 1.12 pg between the 2 parameters. In comparison with CHr, the value of 30.5 pg for RET-He appeared to be the best cut-off point with a very good sensitivity and specificity to determine patients needing iron supplementation. Our study showed an excellent diagnostic efficiency of RET-He to evaluate patients needing iron support and demonstrated a strict correspondence between the classic CHr and the new Ret-He. This correspondence was independent of clinical changes, frequently occurring in dialysis patients.

Patients were classified as having normal, deficient, indeterminate, or overload status depending on the values of TSAT and serum ferritin.

In the remaining 8 patients, iron status was indeterminate; six patients had high serum ferritin with low TSAT (functional iron deficiency), and two patients had high TSAT values and low serum ferritin. Serum ferritin alone had very low specificity in diagnosing iron overload. In conclusion, when used together, TSAT and serum ferritin have a low sensitivity for diagnosing the iron status of CKD patients on HD. When TSAT and serum ferritin values diverge, they become unreliable in guiding iron therapy, and this set of findings generally indicates functional iron deficiency.

We conducted a randomized multicenter controlled trial in adult anemic, iron-deficient non-dialysis CKD (ND-CKD) patients (>or=stage 3) not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).
METHODS: The participants were randomized to receive either a sodium ferric gluconate complex (intravenous iron) 250 mg i.v. weekly x 4 or ferrous sulfate (oral iron) 325 mg t.i.d. x 42 days. Hemoglobin (Hgb), ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were measured serially, and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL) questionnaire was administered on days 1 and 43. The primary outcome variable was change from baseline (CFB) to endpoint in Hgb values.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were analyzed (intravenous iron n = 36, oral iron n = 39). CFB in Hgb was similar in the two groups (intravenous iron 0.4 g/dl vs. oral iron 0.2 g/dl, p = n.s.). However, the increase in Hgb was only significant with intravenous iron (p < 0.01).

The purpose of this work was to study the effects of intravenous (i.v.) iron administration (ferric gluconate - Ferrlecit) on hemoglobin (Hb) of patients with CKD.
METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients with CKD with Hb <12 g/dL in whom no underlying cause for the anemia could be found underwent sternal bone marrow biopsy and had their red cell and blood iron parameters measured. They then received 250 mg of ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) intravenously twice monthly for 3 months, and had their blood parameters measured 1 month later. No patient received erythropoietin (EPO).
RESULTS: Forty-six patients had no evidence of any iron deposits in the bone marrow - consistent with the presence of severe iron deficiency. The mean serum ferritin and %transferrin saturation prior to treatment were 235.9 +/- 54.3 ug/L and 13.5 +/- 4.1%, respectively, and both increased significantly with the iron treatment. Mean Hb increased from 10.16 +/- 1.32 to 11.96 +/- 1.52 g/dL, an increase of 1.80 +/- 1.72 g/dL (p<0.01). Twenty-six patients (55.3%) reached the target Hb of 12 g/dL.

Urinary excretion peaked at 30 min and plasma concentration at 15 min. Plasma MCP-1 concentration fell from 164 +/- 17.7 to 135 +/- 17.7 pg/ml with NAC, whereas it remained unchanged from 133 +/- 12.5 to 132 +/- 17.7 pg/ml with placebo (P=0.001 for visit x antioxidant drug interaction).

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted at a 478-bed community hospital. A medical informatics search was performed to identify all hospitalized patients who were prescribed i.v. iron sucrose to deliver elemental iron 300 mg every other day for three doses between January and December 2002. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they had chronic kidney disease, had an estimated creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, and were prescribed the above regimen. Information on iron administration, vital signs, hematologic values, and iron indexes was gathered from patients' medical records. Medical record review was also used to identify possible adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 73 patients met eligibility criteria and received a total of 167 doses of iron sucrose. Twenty adverse events were judged as possibly related to iron sucrose administration and included nausea (n = 8 events), reduced blood pressure (n = 4), vomiting (n = 2), dysgeusia (n = 2), constipation (n = 2), fatigue (n = 1), and anxiety (n = 1). The majority of these adverse events were low in severity, as determined by an objective scale. No severe adverse events occurred. There was no association between infusion rate and the occurrence of potential adverse events (p = 0.44).

METHODS: In a randomized, controlled multicenter trial, we compared the efficacy of iron sucrose, given as 1 g in divided IV doses over 14 days, with that of ferrous sulfate, given 325 mg orally thrice daily for 56 days in patients with ND-CKD stages 3 to 5, Hb < or =11 g/dL, TSAT < or =25%, and ferritin < or =300 ng/mL. Epoetin/darbepoetin therapy, if any, was not changed for eight weeks prior to or during the study.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients achieving the primary outcome (Hb increase > or =1 g/dL) was greater in the IV iron treatment group than in the oral iron treatment group (44.3% vs. 28.0%, P= 0.0344), as was the mean increase in Hb by day 42 (0.7 vs. 0.4 g/dL, P= 0.0298).

Traditionally, this has been administered as an infusion over 1 or more hours, which requires the use of intravenous fluids and administration tubing, along with extra demands on patient and nursing time.
METHODS: We prospectively investigated the safety and practicality of administering iron sucrose, 200 mg, as a bolus injection over 2 minutes in patients with chronic kidney disease. A total of 2,297 injections were administered to 657 patients. Any adverse events were recorded, including acute anaphylactoid reactions to the iron injection, along with the presence or absence of metallic taste and phlebitis, and these were classified as ""serious"" and ""nonserious.""
RESULTS: The most common adverse event was a mild and transient metallic taste that occurred during 412 injections (17.9%); in no case was this of significant distress to the patient. Excluding this, 2,240 injections (97.5%) proceeded uneventfully, and no case of phlebitis was recorded. Adverse events other than metallic taste were recorded in association with 57 injections (2.5%). Seven of these were caused by an acute anaphylactoid reaction to the intravenous iron. All 7 acute reactions resolved completely within 30 minutes with no sequelae, and none required hospitalization. The remaining 50 adverse events consisted of pain during the injection (n = 31), pain after the injection with or without some bruising (n = 9), nausea/gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 3), lethargy (n = 4), and lightheadedness (n = 3).

Recently, patients with severe cardiac failure and anaemia have also been shown to benefit from this treatment. However, iron excess may lead to the production of free radicals and has been incriminated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and increased risk of infection, the two major causes of death in end-stage renal disease. The exact risk of excess iron supplementation has not been defined and, in the absence of sensitive and specific indicators of iron overload, the risk remains difficult to quantify. There is increasing epidemiological evidence incriminating iron overload as a risk factor in CKD, but direct evidence is still hard to obtain. The precise role of iron is complicated further by the complex inter-relationships between iron metabolism and the inflammatory process characteristic of CKD. The recent discovery of the antimicrobial peptide, hepcidin, may shed light on these inter-relationships.

And anemia, which can result from both CKD and congestive heart failure, has been shown to exacerbate the adverse consequences of these conditions. An early, aggressive correction of anemia in patients with CKD can be implemented to break this cycle and stop disease progression. Studies have shown that anemia correction improves both cardiac and renal function and can result in increased hemoglobin levels, decreased number of hospital days, and improved quality of life. An effective strategy for managing anemia in patients with renal disease and comorbid cardiovascular disease includes the administration of both recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron. In addition, the nephrology nurse plays an integral role in managing anemia and improving outcomes in these patients.

METHODS: We enrolled 96 CKD anemic patients on erythropoietin in a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled study. Patients received 29 days of oral FeSO4 (325 mg t.i.d.) or intravenous (IV) iron sucrose (5 doses of 200 mg weekly). Assessments were made up to 14 days after the last dose. Primary endpoints were changes in hemoglobin and ferritin, and clinical success was evaluated from the percent of patients with combined endpoints of rises in hemoglobin/ferritin, hemoglobin/ferritin/TSAT, and hemoglobin/TSAT.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in hemoglobin values between IV and oral therapy. IV iron patients had greater increases in mean serum ferritin (288 ng/ml, p < 0.0001) compared to oral iron patients (-5.1 ng/ml, p = NS). IV iron patients with baseline ferritin < 100 ng/ml had a greater increase in hemoglobin (1.4 g/dl) compared to oral iron patients (0.9 g/dl) (p < 0.05). More IV iron patients (54.2%) attained hemoglobin values > 11.0 g/dl compared to oral iron patients (31.3%, p = 0.028), and met hemoglobin/ferritin (62.5%), hemoglobin/TSAT (47.9%), hemoglobin/ferritin/TSAT (43.8%), and ferritin/TSAT criteria (54.2%) than oral iron patients (0, 22.9, 0, and 0%, respectively). There were no serious side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These CKD patients had increases in both hemoglobin and ferritin following IV iron therapy, whereas those treated with oral iron had increases in hemoglobin without increases in iron stores.

In experimental models the role of oxidants has been demonstrated in both proliferative glomerulonephritis (e.g., anti-GBM antibody disease) as well as experimental models of minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy.

PATIENTS: Zinc and iron status of 38 nondialyzed patients (63% male; creatinine clearance, 34.5+/-13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2) was evaluated before and after 3 intramuscular injections of 100 mg iron each.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following parameters were analyzed: erythrocytes and plasma zinc, zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), plasma ferritin, transferrin saturation (TFS), and total iron. The patients' diets were analyzed by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists method for macronutrients, and neutron activation analysis was used for iron and zinc concentration determinations.
RESULTS: Ferritin and TFS increased from 86.3+/-67.5 ng/mL to 105.4+/-63.7 ng/mL and from 19.5+/-7.4% to 23.2+/-6.7% (P <.05), respectively, after iron supplementation.

The relationship of oxidative stress and renal injury in patients with CKD is unknown. Whether renal injury can occur at a time point when transferrin is incompletely saturated is also unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel group trial to compare the oxidative stress induced by intravenous administration of 100 mg iron sucrose over 5 minutes and its protection with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in 20 subjects with stage 3 or 4 CKD. Transferrin saturation was measured with urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, oxidative stress by malondialdehyde (MDA) measurement by high-performance liquid chromatography, and renal injury by enzymuria and proteinuria. Reduced and oxidized glutathione and free radical scavengers as well as urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were also measured.
RESULTS: Parenteral iron increased plasma concentration and urinary excretion rate of MDA, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, within 15 to 30 minutes of iron sucrose administration. This was accompanied by enzymuria and increase in proteinuria. In contrast, saturation of transferrin was not maximally seen until 3 hours after the end of infusion. Oxidative stress, enzymuria and proteinuria were transient and were completely resolved in 24 hours. NAC reduced acute generation of systemic oxidative stress but failed to abrogate proteinuria or enzymuria.
CONCLUSION: Intravenous iron produces oxidative stress that is associated with transient proteinuria and tubular damage. The rapid production of oxidative stress even when transferrin is not completely saturation suggests free iron independent mechanism(s) to be operative in producing oxidative stress and transient renal injury.

While oral iron has been disappointing in this regard, parenteral iron has been widely used, despite a significant incidence of severe side effects when iron dextran is used. The recent availability of a more effective form of oral iron (heme-iron), and safer forms of parenteral iron (iron sucrose and iron gluconate) has made iron management in this population simpler. Many questions remain, however, about the use, efficacy, and safety of these compounds in hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: Current literature was reviewed and combined with the authors' clinical experience to address a number of current questions regarding the use of iron in hemodialysis patients.
RESULTS: Although oral non-heme iron is infrequently sufficient to maintain iron stores in hemodialysis patients, recent studies suggest that heme-iron may be more useful in this regard. Heme-iron is absorbed to a greater extent than non-heme iron, and is better tolerated. Small studies have shown that when heme-iron is administered, less parenteral iron and lower doses of erythropoietin (EPO) are needed to maintain target hemoglobin. Current evidence suggests that both iron sucrose and iron gluconate are safer than iron dextran, and the latter should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. While in vitro studies have demonstrated some differences in the effects of iron sucrose and iron gluconate on cellular toxicity, the clinical importance of these has not been determined. Both compounds can be used safely for repletion and maintenance therapy, and doses of up to 300 mg of either are generally well tolerated when such higher doses are needed, as in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients or chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients not on dialysis.

HYPOTHESIS: Pre-dialysis CKD patients may have different needs for iron supplementation than end-stage renal disease subjects during erythropoietin therapy.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of pre-dialysis CKD subjects (n = 31) treated with erythropoietin at our institution.
RESULTS: In this population our results showed that target hematocrit (33-36%) was achievable with erythropoietin (mean subcutaneous dose 86 +/- 17 [SD] units/kg/week) without parenteral iron therapy. The hematocrit increased from a mean baseline value of 28.4 +/- 2.7 to 33.6 +/- 3.4% at time 1 (4-9 weeks, p < 0.0001), and to 37.7 +/- 4.5% at time 2 (10-20 weeks, p < 0.0001). The hemoglobin concentration increased from 9 +/- 0.9 g/dl at baseline to 10.7 +/- 1.1 g/dl at time 1 (p < 0.0001) and to 12 +/- 1.5 g/dl at time 2 (p < 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that pre-dialysis CKD subjects respond adequately to erythropoietin at or lower than recommended erythropoietin doses without parenteral iron. This response extends even to subgroups with TSAT and/or ferritin levels deemed to indicate iron deficiency in CKD subjects, and may be due to lack of existence of functional iron deficiency in this group of patients.","2003",,"Am J Nephrol",,"comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"12460028","Iron sucrose: the oldest iron therapy becomes new.","Yee J","Several parenteral iron preparations are now available. This article focuses on iron sucrose, a hematinic, used more widely than any other for more than five decades, chiefly in Europe and now available in North America. Iron sucrose has an average molecular weight of 34 to 60 kd, and after intravenous (IV) administration, it distributes into a volume equal to that of plasma, with a terminal half-life of 5 to 6 hours. Transferrin and ferritin levels can be measured reliably 48 hours after IV administration of this agent. Iron sucrose carries no ""black-box"" warning, and a test dose is not required before it is administered. Doses of 100 mg can be administered over several minutes, and larger doses up to 300 mg can be administered within 60 minutes. The efficacy of iron sucrose has been shown in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) both before and after the initiation of dialysis therapy. Iron sucrose, like iron gluconate, has been associated with a markedly lower incidence of life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions and may be administered safely to those with previously documented intolerance to iron dextran or iron gluconate. Nonanaphylactoid reactions, including non-life-threatening hypotension, nausea, and exanthema, also are extremely uncommon with iron sucrose. Management of patients with the anemia of CKD mandates that we carefully examine the effectiveness and safety of this oldest of iron preparations and the accumulating present-day data regarding it and contemporaneous agents.","2002",,"Am J Kidney Dis",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"12430092","Issues related to iron replacement in chronic kidney disease.","Agarwal R","Recent epidemiologic studies show that iron deficiency occurs in the vast majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD, increased iron losses and, to a lesser extent, poor oral absorption, can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Correction of iron-deficiency anemia is preferable by the oral route, however, data on oral iron use are limited in this population. In CKD patients, parenteral iron administered with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo), is the best potential option for the correction of anemia. Nondextran iron preparations are preferable because of a reduced incidence of serious adverse events. Parenteral iron in CKD patients may not be entirely innocuous and, although commonly used, have not received Food and Drug Administration approval for use in this patient population. Exposure to intravenous (IV) iron may lead to oxidative stress, renal injury, infection, cardiovascular disease, and osteomalacia. Studies are needed to confirm the existence and magnitude of these complications. The current data suggest that the overall risk-benefit ratio favors use of IV iron when compared with untreated or partially treated iron-deficiency anemia.","2002",,"Semin Nephrol",," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

,"11726002","Considerations for optimal iron use for anemia due to chronic kidney disease.","Hudson JQ","BACKGROUND: Availability of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has improved the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron deficiency is the most common cause of resistance to rHuEPO therapy, contributing to ineffective erythropoiesis and hematocrit/hemoglobin values below the recommended target range (33%-36%/11-12 g/dL). I.v. iron supplementation is necessary to meet increased iron demands from stimulation of erythropoiesis and chronic blood loss; however, questions remain as to the optimal supplementation strategy to maintain appropriate yet safe iron status. Treatment guidelines for anemia management have been developed through the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI).
OBJECTIVE: This review presents the basis of need for the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines and includes detailed information concerning iron physiology, metabolism, iron preparations, and evaluation of iron status.
METHODS: This review was based on a MEDLINE search and complemented by references from the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines (whose review extended beyond MEDLINE). References focusing on normal iron physiology and metabolism, alterations in iron physiology in patients with CKD, laboratory evaluation methods, and strategies for iron supplementation were obtained from MEDLINE and reviewed for content.
RESULTS: Controversy over appropriate use of iron supplementation has led to disparity in accepted practice procedures. Oral iron (ferrous salts and polysaccharide iron complex) and i.v. iron preparations (iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, and iron sucrose) are available. Problems with oral iron supplementation include limited absorption and patient noncompliance. Although most available data on i.v. iron use in the United States are specific to iron dextran preparations, published information based on clinical use of sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose products has been promising. The use of chronic i.v. iron administration to sustain iron stores has been more widely accepted to prevent development of absolute and functional iron deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Although iron therapy is commonly warranted in patients with CKD, questions remain as to the most favorable supplementation strategy to optimize therapy through improvements in hematocrits, efficient use of rHuEPO, and maintenance of appropriate and safe iron levels. Clinicians will need to devise strategies based on the compilation of information from clinical experience and the available literature. Clinical practice guidelines devised by the NKF-K/DOQI have provided a useful tool for the medical community using both these resources.","2001",,"Clin Ther"," OBJECTIVE : This review presents the basis of need for the NKF-K / DOQI guidelines and includes detailed information concerning iron physiology , metabolism , iron preparations , and evaluation of iron status "," review",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"1462986","Iron accumulation in human chronic renal disease.","Nankivell BJ","Iron, which has been shown to accumulate within proximal tubule lysosomes in proteinuric models of renal disease, may play a role in the progression of chronic renal disease by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, renal biopsies from humans with proteinuria and/or chronic renal failure were examined at an ultrastructural level for iron by energy dispersive analysis and compared with normal biopsies. Iron accumulated in proximal tubular lysosomes in renal disease (P < 0.05 v normals), accompanied in some cases by phosphorus and silicon. Both the number of iron-containing lysosomes per tubular cross-section (1.86 +/- 0.41 v 0.66 +/- 0.22, P < 0.05) and the mean concentration of lysosomal iron (254.5 +/- 73.4 mg/dL v 81.2 +/- 23.8, P < 0.001) was greater in patients with nephrotic syndrome (n = 12) than in those without (n = 8). Iron accumulation (number of iron-containing lysosomes/tubule) correlated with protein excretion (r = 0.68, P = 0.003, n = 20), but not with glomerular filtration rate. Damaged tubules contained greater amounts of iron than tubules with less damage (288.5 +/- 68.5 mg/dL v 80.4 +/- 13.9, P < 0.01). Further studies are needed to define the possible role of iron in causing tubular damage and progression of renal disease.","1992",,"Am J Kidney Dis",,"other",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
,"3124456","Prospective controlled study of androgen therapy in the anemia of chronic renal disease: effects on iron kinetics.","Solomon LR","Ferrokinetic and RBC mass determinations were made at 3-month intervals in iron-replete hemodialysis patients randomized to a control group or to nandrolone decanoate therapy. After 3 months, RBC mass increased in two of 4 androgen-treated patients. Erythron iron turnover, an index of RBC production, increased in the one responder studied but not in the two nonresponders. Similarly, in a fifth subject, who was not restudied until 6 months of androgen therapy were completed, an increase in RBC mass was associated with an increase in erythron iron turnover. However, between 3 and 6 months, RBC mass increased in all 4 androgen-treated patients studied even though erythron iron turnovers remained unchanged and dialysis-associated blood losses did not decrease. Thus, at least two androgen-treated patients had increases in RBC mass without ever increasing their erythron iron turnover. Two of three control subjects also had increased erythron iron turnovers, which in one case was related to increased dialysis-associated blood losses. Changes in RBC mass were not consistently paralleled by changes in Hb. These findings suggest that increases in RBC mass during nandrolone decanoate therapy result from two mechanisms: increased erythropoiesis (shown by simultaneous increases in RBC mass and erythron iron turnover) and increased RBC survival (indirectly shown by increases in RBC mass without increases in erythron iron turnover). The importance of control groups, RBC mass determinations and the monitoring of dialysis-associated blood losses in studying the effects of androgens on erythropoiesis in chronic hemodialysis patients is also demonstrated.","1988",,"Acta Haematol",,"clinical trial",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"

The diet is capable of maintaining nitrogenous equilibrium for a long period of time. However, the chemical composition of the diet does not meet iron requirements of patients with chronic renal diseases. Besides, the quantitative ratio of the ingredients such as proteins and carbohydrates has an adverse effect on iron absorption, the greatest portion of iron contained by the diet is bound with products of plant origin and absorbed by the body to a negligible degree. It is recommended that the diet suggested be supplemented with readily available iron preparations.","1982",,"Vopr Pitan",,"comparative study",1,"ckdIronPub","2023-12-21"
