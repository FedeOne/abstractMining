To evaluate rates of infusion reactions among 4 commonly used intravenous iron repletion strategies and determine how patients with history of reaction should be managed, a cohort study was conducted at 6 centers in Portland, Oregon. The study included all patients receiving intravenous iron infusions from January 1, 2015 to September 7, 2021. Participants were not restricted by etiology and totaled 12,237 individuals with iron deficiency. Infusion reactions were measured by surrogate markers (diphenhydramine, epinephrine, famotidine, hydrocortisone). A range of intravenous iron formulations and administration alongside various concomitant medications were considered in the study.

Conclusion: The prevalence of ID was significantly higher (54.4%) in HFpEF patients compared with the general population (2-10%). In this study, ID was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure in HFpEF patients.

Therefore, I can conclude that the CHF patients in this context belong to the adult age class. or 66.2±11.5 years","58.5% males and 41.5% females, so the correct answer is mostly men.","iron deficiency, heart failure",,1,"ckdIron"

The study population included 96,066 deliveries, with 75,666 (78.7%) being anemic women at admission for delivery, as determined using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The cesarean rate was significantly higher in the anemic group compared to nonanemic women (32.9% vs 25.4%, p<0.001). Adjusted OR and 95% CI were calculated for all variables that affected the study outcome (cesarean rates) and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

study population and were given an unspecified iron supplementation regimen. Risk estimates based on mortality associated with the use of IV iron are similar between the RCTs and observational studies (RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.72, 0.96). The risk of infection was not significantly different between patients receiving IV iron therapy compared to those who did not receive any parenteral iron (OR = 1.04; 95% CI 0.80, 1.35). CONCLUSION Parental intravenous iron is safe and does not increase the risk of infections or mortality among hemodialysis patients when compared to placebo or no parenteral iron administration.","end-stage renal disease","Infections",1,"ckdIron"

In a recent cohort study, individuals aged 35-74 years were followed for up to 7 years to examine the association between body iron stores and risk of type 2 diabetes. A total of 849 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified during the follow-up period in EPIC-Potsdam study, including a sub-cohort of 2,500 individuals randomly selected from the full cohort after excluding participants with missing data or abnormal glucose levels at baseline.
The results showed that after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, sports activity, bicycling, education, occupational activity, smoking habit, alcohol consumption and circulating levels of γ-glutrophic-glutric-gluc-glutrophthese proteinsulnine glut, the following biomics-glutric transaminotrans, high-glut, the following variables like fetuincreat least, there was not available in the risk factors such asparticipants, there were found that are associated with a number of γ-glucTGGT, or 1.73","mostly women.","type 2 diabetes, ","body iron stores and risk of type 2 diabetes",1,"ckdIron"

The MIMIC III group consisted of elderly patients with CHF (mean age: 65.0±14.9 years). The reference group was defined as patients with serum ferritin levels above a cut-off value of 7 ng/mL, which is considered to be in the normal range for adults. In this study, we found that an increased serum ferritin level (≥10.25 ng/mL) was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with the reference group. Conversely, decreased serum ferritin levels (<7 ng/mL) were not linked to improved survival. In addition, both linear and logistic regression models demonstrated that serum ferritin level is significantly related to 6-month all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with CHF.
In the MIMIC IV group, the mean age was slightly higher (69.5±12.9 years), and patients with lower levels of serum ferriton and intermediate range values forearned serum ferritincome were more elderly increased serum ferriton serum ferritincome statuseser or 1.76","mostly men","heart failure, ","High ferritin levels",1,"ckdIron"

CONTEXT BACKGROUND & AIMS Epidemiological data on iron status and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are still controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether low serum iron (SI) levels are associated with an increased odds of first CVD event in a population at high cardiovascular risk. METHODS Casecontrol study design nested within the ""PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea"" (PREDIMED) trial. A total of 207 participants diagnosed with CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death) during followup period (20032010) were matched by sex, age and intervention group to 436 controls by incidence density sampling.

CONTEXT: BACKGROUND: To investigate the serum level of hepcidin and its relationship with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients.
METHODS: Blood was obtained from 75 MHD patients before undergoing hemodialysis and 20 healthy controls. Serum hepcidin, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Spearman correlation, and binary logistic regression linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between serumbreaking analysis were used to assess the relationship between serum to assess the relationship between serumptions were used to assess the relationship between serum to assess the relationship between serum analys to assess the relationship between serum used to assess the relationship between serum analyses to assess the relationship between serum to assess the relationship between serumlaugh applied to assess the assess the relationship between the relationships to assess the assess the assess the assess the relationship between serum to assess the relationship between serumto assess the or 1.32","mostly men.","cardiovascular disease, ",,1,"ckdIron"

ients was 61% (87/142) and most anemia had a mild degree (Hb <12 g). In the intervention group with treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin plus intravenous iron, the prevalence of severe anemia decreased from 50% at entry to only 9.2% after six months. The mean Hb increased significantly (from 10.4 g/dL to 13.7 g/dL) and the ejection fraction improved in both ventricles (by 16%). The hospitalization rate during the study period was reduced by approximately half.

CONTEXT: PURPOSE: To study which laboratory malnutrition markers best predict 1-year mortality in the general population of hospitalized older adults as well as among patients at risk for malnutrition. METHODS: A historical prospective study. All older adults (age ≥ 65 years) hospitalized in one geriatric department during 9 months were included. Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) was used to determine malnutrition risk. Laboratory malnutrition markers included albumin serum levels, transferrin serum levels, total cholesterol serum levels, vitamin D serum levels, and lymphocyte count. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to study which markers best predict 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1- 1- 1- 1- 1- 1- 1-1-1-1-1-1-1 or 84.7 years","63.2% women.","malnutrition, ",,1,"ckdIron"

CONTEXT: BACKGROUND: Anemia aggravates the disease course and the survival rate of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. The purpose of the study was to investigate the level of erythropoietin (EPO) in CHF patients with anemic syndrome, with the aim to more accurately assess the severity of the disease and its treatment, depending on the anemia degree. METHODS: Patients with ischemic CHF of I-IV functional class (FC) with and without anemia were examined (total number of patients=208, patients with anemia=174). The EPO was determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Before treatment, the patients underwent the following medical therapy: Medical therapid="""" medical therapy.medical therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy therapy therapy therapy: medical therapy: medical therapy:   medical therapy medical therapy medical therapy:  medical therapy: Medical therap or 174","mostly men.","heart failure, ",,1,"ckdIron"

The mortality rate was 20%, with cardiovascular diseases being the most common cause (56%). Multivariate Binary Logistic regression analysis showed that polymorbidity and malnutrition were associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.07-3.52; OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.16-3.71, respectively).

The study included 451 elderly patients aged 65 years and older who were hospitalized between 15th March and 30th April 2020 with COVID19. The mean age was 74.8±7.46, and 51.2% of the participants were female. On average, the patients had 1.9±1.28 comorbidities, and the nutritional risk screening tool showed that 64.7% of the elderly COVID19 patients were at risk for malnutrition (according to NRSI2002).

ConTEXT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The ability of low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) to control the unprecedented cytokine release associated with COVID19 pathogenesis has been an area of widespread research since the COVID pandemic. It has not been studied adequately whether the antiinflammatory effect of LDRT provides additional benefit when used concurrently with steroids amongst other standard pharmacologic therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS 51 RTPCR positive COVID19 patients were recruited between November 2020 and July 2021. They are given standardized the demograph All had SpO. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1","respiratory distress",,1,"ckdIron"

The nutritional status of the children with congenital heart disease showed an overall prevalence of malnutrition of 83.3%, which was higher in those with PH (p = 0.0140). This patient's group was more wasted than the group without PH (median z score of weight for height -1.65 vs -0.78). There was a high occurrence of measurements of arm fat area below the 5th percentile. The comparison of plasma protein levels with the control group showed significant differences in prealbumin values (p = 0.0294) and albumin values (p < 0.001), but no differences were found for transferrin.","mostly women.","congenital heart disease, malnutrition","pulmonary hypertension",1,"ckdIron"
