CONTEXT PURPOSE To evaluate whether neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and urodynamic parameters predict the outcomes of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). METHODS A retrospective study was performed in patients who were diagnosed with MSA and underwent urodynamic studies simultaneously from September 2014 to July 2018. The urodynamic traces were reviewed by urologists. Detrusor contractility was evaluated by the bladder contractility index (BCI) and Schäfer nomogram. Telephone followup was conducted in July 2019 to acquire survival data. Clinical and urodynamic parameters were analyzed for survival using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Overall, 70 patients with information not mentioned that are elig","multiple system atrophy, urinary incontinence",,1,"MSA"

CONTEXT BACKGROUND Cognitive impairment is a clinical feature of multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, the prevalence and factors influencing the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in MSA patients remain unclear. OBJECTIVE We aim to provide an estimate of the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with MSA and to evaluate the possible effect of demographic, clinical and methodological factors on the prevalence.
METHODS We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of science databases to identify studies that report the prevalence of cognitive impairment or dementia in MSA published up to February 2022. We computed the estimates of the pooled prevalence using randomeffects models. Heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analyses and meta

CONTEXT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Knowledge about the seizure prevalence in the whole symptomatic course, from disease onset to death, in neurodegenerative diseases (ND) is lacking. Therefore, the aim was to investigate seizure prevalence and associated clinical implications in neuropathologically diagnosed ND.
METHODS Clinical records of cases from the Neurobiobank Munich, Germany, were analyzed. Neuropathological diagnoses of the assessed cases included Alzheimer disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Lewy body disease (LBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (P. Seizy (P. Seiz (P. Seiz (P. Seiz (P. Seiz (P. Seiz (P.y (P(Pys (Psy (PSP (P. Seiz (P. Seiz (P.

From the methodology, it's important that both PD and MSA-P groups have a careful early stage diagnosis. To help with this, they are looking into whether pelvic organ dysfunction examination would be helpful to distinguish between these two conditions. The study involved 61 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 54 patients with parkinsonian-type multiple system atrophy (MSA-P). They used a questionnaire on pelvic organ dysfunction for each patient group, assessing bladder, bowel, and sexual function. The results were then compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

CONTEXT BACKGROUND Previous studies have found an association between the granulin gene rs5848 and microtubuleassociated protein tau gene (MAPT) rs242557 polymorphisms and susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the results of association studies between the two polymorphisms and PD have been inconsistent. Given the overlap in clinical and pathological characteristics of PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA), we examined the associations of these two polymorphisms with PD and MSA in a subset of the Chinese population. METHODS In total, 1270 PD patients, 360 MSA patients and 830 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study participants were included in total) were included in the context) were included in the sex mostly men) were included in the possible choices are included in the context) were included in a...

The diagnostic power of STS scale for parkinsonism was high (area under curve [AUC] = 0.829) with 65% sensitivity and 85% specificity compared to PD alone, which had an AUC of 0.743. The correlation between disease severity and STS scale was significant in all three parkinsonian subtypes (r = 0.521-0.629).
CONCLUSION: Loss of swallow tail sign on susceptibility map-weighted imaging is a valuable diagnostic feature for parkinsonism and may have potential to reflect disease severity in PD, PSP, and MSA. or sts scale ≤3","mostly men.
The present study involved 99 patients (55 PD, 29 PSP, and 15 MSA) and 47 healthy controls (HC). The purpose was to investigate the diagnostic and differential diagnostic value of STS scale on susceptibility mapweighted imaging (SMWI) in PS, including Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), and to evaluate its correlation with disease severity.
The study involved the following methods
1. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used for imaging.
2. STS scale on SMWI was visually assessed.
3. STS scale at participant level calculated using a range of summing and bial total of summing from 0summsumming method where STSums. sum of 0biliability of bilaterbalge of sum of sum of sum of sum of sum of 0summing SMWI derived score ranging from 000summing bilateralculum of 0summing bilater","Parkinson's disease","multiple system atrophy",1,"MSA"

However, systematic knowledge about the first reported clinical symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases is lacking. Therefore, the aim was to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of the first clinical symptom (FS) as assessed by medical history in neuropathologically proven neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: Neuropathological diagnoses from the Neurobiobank Munich, Germany, were matched with clinical records for analyses of the diagnostic and prognostic values of FSs.

CONTEXT: BACKGROUND: It is accepted that orthostatic hypotension is a clinical marker for the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy, but conflicting data indicate that it may also be present in Parkinson disease (PD). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of autonomic cardiovascular impairment and orthostatic hypotension in a large group of patients with de novo PD, followed up for at least 7 years, to clinically confirm the diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: During a 2-year recruiting period, 60 untreated patients diagnosed as having idiopathic PD underwent autonomic cardiovascular function evaluation using the Ewing test. Patients subsequently received dopaminergic therapy and their condition was followed up for at least  up for at least  up for at least for at least for at least for at least  up for at least  up for at least  up for at least  up for at least  up for at least  up for at least 7up for at least  up for at least  up for at least ","mostly men.","sympathetic and parasympathetic failure","parkinsonian syndrome",1,"MSA"

CONTEXT: BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is marked by abnormal inclusions of alpha-synuclein in oligodendrogliocytes. Etiology remains unknown. Variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene have been associated with other synucleinopathies, dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease. It is unclear whether glucocerebrosidase variants are associated with MSA. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the frequency of glucocerebrosidase gene variants among autopsy-proven cases of MSA at a brain bank in New York City.

Study 2: Correlation between history of pneumonia and swallowing function in patients with MSA.

CONTEXT OBJECTIVE To examine whether there are urogenital criteria that the urologist could apply to a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and bladder symptoms, and so avoid operating on patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinical features of 52 patients with probable MSA and 41 patients with IPD were studied retrospectively with particular attention to the nature of lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction in relation to the onset of parkinsonism. Anal sphincter electromyography (EMG) was recorded in all the patients with MSA and in 12 of the patients with IPD. RESClin. RES

BACKGROUND REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is typically linked to synucleinopathies (SP). In this study we analyzed the utility and performance of RBD as a tool for the differential diagnosis of the most common forms of degenerative parkinsonism, including SPs and tauopathies.
METHODS Patients with a syndromic diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonism matched for gender, age, and disease stage were assessed using a structured protocol with demographic and clinical data, including the diagnosis of probable RBD (pRBD), ascertained clinically using established criteria.

RESULTS: Of the 386 participants with neurodegenerative movement disorders, 174 (45%) were aged ≥65 years at death, 208 (54%) were <65 years old at death, and 4 were aged information not available. Most of those who died (n = 239) received acute care in the last year of life; 10% (n = 39) did so exclusively in an ED or hospital. Among survivors (n = 74), outpatient visits increased from n = 15 at age <65 years to n = 28 at age ≥65 years, with a higher proportion of those aged ≥65 years using both specialist and generalist services compared with younger participants.
CONCLUSION: Health care utilization was substantial in the last year of life among individuals with neurodegenerative movement disorders. Inpatient utilization increased with pallikey measures, including EDs were highest among those who died predominated predominated predominated predominated by younger than outp was common in this age  or 47","mostly men","neurodegenerative movement disorders","outpatient neurology or palliative care",1,"MSA"

CONTEXT Autonomic dysfunction has rarely been studied in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS). Some hypotheses have concerned the pathophysiology, especially with regard to a possible spinal cord origin. However, there have been no previous studies on autonomic dysfunction in MS and spinal cord lesions. This study assessed the frequency of autonomic dysfunction (AD) in MS and the correlation to spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. We prospectively studied 75 MS patients (25 with relapsingremitting forms, 25 with secondary progressive forms and 25 with primary progressive forms). We performed sympathetic skin response, RR interval variability and orthostatic hypotension testing. Spinal cord MRI was performed to detect demyelinating lesions (sagittal and axial plane) or spinal cord atrophy. Clinical and laboratory evidence of AD was found in MS was found in  AD was found in MS was found in MS was found AD was found AD was found AD was found in MS was found in MS was found in MS was found in MS","multiple sclerosis","autonomic dysfunction",1,"MSA"

Context INTRODUCTION Cognitive impairment is an important predictor of quality of life at all stages of MS. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) markers have been used to associate tissue damage with cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to designate the MRI marker that predicts cognitive decline and explore its effect on every day activities and employment status. METHODS 50 RRMS patients and 31 healthy participants underwent neuropsychological assessment using the Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B, semantic and phonological verbal fluency task and a computerized cognitive screening battery (Central Nervous System Vital Signs). Everyday activities were evaluated with the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale and employment status. Brain

PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred thirty-four patients with FTD, including primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia, FTD/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), FTD/motor neuron disease, corticobasal syndrome/corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick disease, dementia lacking distinctive histopathology, and pathologically confirmed cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U); and 111 non-FTD cases (controls).
The age class in the given context is adult and mixed.","mostly men.
MAIN RESULTS Out of 434 FTD patients, 217 (50%) were male, and 217 (50%) were female. In controls, 68 (61%) were male, and 43 (39%) were female. There was no significant difference in the sex distribution between cases and controls for FTD patients or nonFTD controls.
CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of men in FTD cases and control participants does not differ significantly from that observed in the general population, which indicates a potential influence of factors other than gender on disease susceptibility.","ALS","Haploinsufficiency of GRN",1,"MSA"

CONTEXT: BACKGROUND: Treatment of acne scars remains a challenge to dermatologists. Multiple modalities have been employed with variable results and adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and adverse effects of a fractional radiofrequency microneedle system (FRMS) on acne scars in Asians at 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up visits after treatment. METHODS: Thirty subjects with atrophic acne scars for more than 6 months were enrolled in the study. All volunteers were treated with a FRMS on affected areas. The subjects were treated for a total number of three treatment sessions at 1-month intervals. Subjective assessments were obtained at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months after the last treatment session by self-evaluation and two blinded dermatologists.","mostly women.","acne, ",,1,"MSA"
