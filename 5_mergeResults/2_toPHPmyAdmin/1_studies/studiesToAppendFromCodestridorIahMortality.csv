,"16282178"," Obstructive sleep apnea as a risk factor for stroke and death. ","Yaggi H. et al.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome may be an important risk factor for stroke. It has not been determined, however, whether the syndrome is independently related to the risk of stroke or death from any cause after adjustment for other risk factors, including hypertension. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, consecutive patients underwent polysomnography, and subsequent events (strokes and deaths) were verified. The diagnosis of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was based on an apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or higher (five or more events per hour); patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of less than 5 served as the comparison group. Proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the independent effect of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome on the composite outcome of stroke or death from any cause. RESULTS: Among 1022 enrolled patients, 697 (68 percent) had the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. At baseline, the mean apnea-hypopnea index in the patients with the syndrome was 35, as compared with a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 2 in the comparison group. In an unadjusted analysis, the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was associated with stroke or death from any cause (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.86; P=0.004). After adjustment for age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol-consumption status, body-mass index, and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome retained a statistically significant association with stroke or death (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.12 to 3.48; P=0.01). In a trend analysis, increased severity of sleep apnea at baseline was associated with an increased risk of the development of the composite end point (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome significantly increases the risk of stroke or death from any cause, and the increase is independent of other risk factors, including hypertension.","2005","The New England journal of medicine",,"Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"15298493"," Hydrogen peroxide poisoning. ","Watt B. et al.","Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidising agent that is used in a number of household products, including general-purpose disinfectants, chlorine-free bleaches, fabric stain removers, contact lens disinfectants and hair dyes, and it is a component of some tooth whitening products. In industry, the principal use of hydrogen peroxide is as a bleaching agent in the manufacture of paper and pulp. Hydrogen peroxide has been employed medicinally for wound irrigation and for the sterilisation of ophthalmic and endoscopic instruments. Hydrogen peroxide causes toxicity via three main mechanisms: corrosive damage, oxygen gas formation and lipid peroxidation. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide is caustic and exposure may result in local tissue damage. Ingestion of concentrated (>35%) hydrogen peroxide can also result in the generation of substantial volumes of oxygen. Where the amount of oxygen evolved exceeds its maximum solubility in blood, venous or arterial gas embolism may occur. The mechanism of CNS damage is thought to be arterial gas embolisation with subsequent brain infarction. Rapid generation of oxygen in closed body cavities can also cause mechanical distension and there is potential for the rupture of the hollow viscus secondary to oxygen liberation. In addition, intravascular foaming following absorption can seriously impede right ventricular output and produce complete loss of cardiac output. Hydrogen peroxide can also exert a direct cytotoxic effect via lipid peroxidation. Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide may cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract with nausea, vomiting, haematemesis and foaming at the mouth; the foam may obstruct the respiratory tract or result in pulmonary aspiration. Painful gastric distension and belching may be caused by the liberation of large volumes of oxygen in the stomach. Blistering of the mucosae and oropharyngeal burns are common following ingestion of concentrated solutions, and laryngospasm and haemorrhagic gastritis have been reported. Sinus tachycardia, lethargy, confusion, coma, convulsions, stridor, sub-epiglottic narrowing, apnoea, cyanosis and cardiorespiratory arrest may ensue within minutes of ingestion. Oxygen gas embolism may produce multiple cerebral infarctions. Although most inhalational exposures cause little more than coughing and transient dyspnoea, inhalation of highly concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide can cause severe irritation and inflammation of mucous membranes, with coughing and dyspnoea. Shock, coma and convulsions may ensue and pulmonary oedema may occur up to 24-72 hours post exposure. Severe toxicity has resulted from the use of hydrogen peroxide solutions to irrigate wounds within closed body cavities or under pressure as oxygen gas embolism has resulted. Inflammation, blistering and severe skin damage may follow dermal contact. Ocular exposure to 3% solutions may cause immediate stinging, irritation, lacrimation and blurred vision, but severe injury is unlikely. Exposure to more concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions (>10%) may result in ulceration or perforation of the cornea. Gut decontamination is not indicated following ingestion, due to the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase to oxygen and water. If gastric distension is painful, a gastric tube should be passed to release gas. Early aggressive airway management is critical in patients who have ingested concentrated hydrogen peroxide, as respiratory failure and arrest appear to be the proximate cause of death. Endoscopy should be considered if there is persistent vomiting, haematemesis, significant oral burns, severe abdominal pain, dysphagia or stridor. Corticosteroids in high dosage have been recommended if laryngeal and pulmonary oedema supervene, but their value is unproven. Endotracheal intubation, or rarely, tracheostomy may be required for life-threatening laryngeal oedema. Contaminated skin should be washed with copious amounts of water. Skin lesions should be treated as thermal burns; surgery may be required for deep burns. In the case of eye exposure, the affected eye(s) shod eye(s) should be irrigated immediately and thoroughly with water or 0.9% saline for at least 10-15 minutes. Instillation of a local anaesthetic may reduce discomfort and assist more thorough decontamination.","2004","Toxicological reviews",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"8973516"," Stridor in neonates. ","Mancuso R.","Stridor in neonates and infants is a symptom that indicates partial obstruction of the large diameter airways. Its presence should prompt a thorough examination and workup. Steps in evaluating stridor include a careful history and physical examination and rapid assessment of the severity of the clinical situation. Infants with respiratory distress and severe stridor should be safely and urgently transported to a tertiary care center, and colleagues from the departments of otolaryngology and anesthesia-critical care should be alerted. An essential component of the physical examination is auscultation. The phase of respiration in which the stridor is heard best provides important clues to help localize its cause. Radiographs, including plain films, dynamic fluoroscopic airway films, contrast esophagography, CT, and MR imaging are useful in specific clinical situations, based on the likely differential diagnosis. The anatomic causes for stridor in infants and neonates are vast. Successful management depends on expert consultation, proper equipment, and a staff that is experienced in the management of pediatric airway problems. The trend over the past decade has been to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality and also to decrease the number of tracheotomies necessary to stabilize pediatric airways. The best treatment outcomes result when there is good cooperation and communication among pediatricians, otolaryngologists, pulmonologists, and anesthesiologists.","1996","Pediatric clinics of North America",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

,"12776412"," Bugged. ","Ayling J.","This was a great save. The crew could easily have missed the presentation of anaphylaxis and let the window for treatment with epinephrine slip away. This patient was in anaphylactic shock. There were no signs that supported a traumatic injury, and that, combined with diaphoresis, urticaria and tachycardic central pulse, contributed to the suspicion of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is classified as distributive shock. This type of shock is caused by profound systemic vasodilation, and the heart is unable to increase output enough to maintain blood pressure. Other causes of distributive shock include sepsis and spinal cord injury. It is rare to have both hypotension and wheezing in such cases. In an anaphylactic reaction, an allergen, such as a food protein, medication, insect venom or latex, is introduced into the body. The mast cells of the immune system have a protein on their surface called IgE antibodies (Immunoglobulin E). The mast cells are filled with histamines [table: see text] and leukotrienes, which are chemical mediators. These are released when the allergen reacts with the IgE antibodies. When these mediators are released, they cause smooth-muscle constriction in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, resulting in wheezing, stridor, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. They also cause vascular dilation, leading to edema and urticaria. Most patients will present with either profound vascular effect (shock) or wheezing; this is a rather rare presentation of a patient having both. The medication best suited to counteract the effects of these medicators is epinephrine. Epinephrine is an alpha- and beta-agonist, acting to constrict the vasculature and dilate the smooth muscles in the bronchial tree. Antihistamines can alleviate symptoms of anaphylaxis, but should only be used in addition to epinephrine, not as a substitute. In life-threatening reactions, epinephrine must be given quickly and in a form that the body can distribute. Use of the subcutaneous route with a solution mixed at 1:1,000 dilution is appropriate in most patients, but if the patient is in profound shock and not perfusing the skin (pale, cold, clammy skin), then a more diluted concentration must be given i.v. at a slow rate (1 cc every minute of the 1:1,000 dilution) until the patient recovers. If i.v. access is delayed or not available, give the 1:1,000 dilution intramuscularly, in the tongue or down the endotracheal tube. Refer to your local protocols for dosage, but the usual dose of epinephrine is 0.3-0.5 mg, or 0.01 mg/kg in a child. There are more than 40 million people in the U.S. with allergic histories that place them at risk for developing anaphylaxis. Each year over 5,000 deaths are attributed to anaphylaxis. The risk of death from anaphylaxis increases with a more rapid onset of signs and symptoms. Up to 25% of patients will experience a biphasic reaction. This means there is a recurrence of symptoms several hours after the initial reaction, and it is prudent to observe patients for a period of time following their initial treatment.","2003","Emergency medical services",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"14717876"," Cardiovascular causes of airway compression. ","Kussman B. et al.","Compression of the paediatric airway is a relatively common and often unrecognized complication of congenital cardiac and aortic arch anomalies. Airway obstruction may be the result of an anomalous relationship between the tracheobronchial tree and vascular structures (producing a vascular ring) or the result of extrinsic compression caused by dilated pulmonary arteries, left atrial enlargement, massive cardiomegaly, or intraluminal bronchial obstruction. A high index of suspicion of mechanical airway compression should be maintained in infants and children with recurrent respiratory difficulties, stridor, wheezing, dysphagia, or apnoea unexplained by other causes. Prompt diagnosis is required to avoid death and minimize airway damage. In addition to plain chest radiography and echocardiography, diagnostic investigations may consist of barium oesophagography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography, cardiac catheterization and bronchoscopy. The most important recent advance is MRI, which can produce high quality three-dimensional reconstruction of all anatomic elements allowing for precise anatomic delineation and improved surgical planning. Anaesthetic technique will depend on the type of vascular ring and the presence of any congenital heart disease or intrinsic lesions of the tracheobronchial tree. Vascular rings may be repaired through a conventional posterolateral thoracotomy, or utilizing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or robotic endoscopic surgery. Persistent airway obstruction following surgical repair may be due to residual compression, secondary airway wall instability (malacia), or intrinsic lesions of the airway. Simultaneous repair of cardiac defects and vascular tracheobronchial compression carries a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.","2004","Paediatric anaesthesia",,"Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"14532320"," Obstructive sleep apnea: implications for cardiac and vascular disease. ","Shamsuzzaman A. et al.","CONTEXT: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been increasingly implicated in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the interactions of OSA with cardiovascular pathophysiology and diseases. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: The MEDLINE database from January 1966 to March 2003 was searched using the Medical Subject Headings sleep, sleep apnea, obesity, hypertension, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, stroke, sympathetic activity, endothelium, inflammation, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to identify peer-reviewed studies of OSA. Priority was given to large prospective cohort studies and to randomized controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION: We identified 154 original investigations and reviews of sleep-related breathing disorders. Data from these studies were examined for relevance and extracted by one of the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Approximately 1 in 5 adults has at least mild OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [ie, the number of apneic and hypopneic events per hour], 5-15), and 1 in 15 adults has at least moderate OSA (apnea-hypopnea index, 15-30). Repetitive apneic events disrupt the normal physiologic interactions between sleep and the cardiovascular system. Such sleep fragmentation, as well as abnormalities evident in patients with OSA (eg, increased sympathetic activation, vascular endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, inflammation, increased platelet aggregability, metabolic dysregulation), may be implicated in the initiation and progression of cardiac and vascular disease. Persuasive data implicate OSA in the development of hypertension, and OSA also may contribute to cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps also to cerebrovascular disease and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea is common, readily diagnosed, and usually treatable. It frequently coexists undiagnosed in patients with cardiovascular disease, activates disease mechanisms known to elicit cardiac and vascular damage, and may be implicated in progression of cardiovascular disease and resistance to conventional therapeutic strategies. In the absence of definitive evidence from large-scale trials and a better understanding of potential cost-effectiveness, the likely benefits of diagnosis and treatment of OSA are presently best appraised on an individualized patient basis.","2003","JAMA"," OBJECTIVE : To systematically review the interactions of OSA with cardiovascular pathophysiology and diseases ","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"18496162"," Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis: a review. ","Derkay C. and Wiatrak B.","Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), which is caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11, is the most common benign neoplasm of the larynx among children and the second most frequent cause of childhood hoarseness. After changes in voice, stridor is the second most common symptom, first inspiratory and then biphasic. Less common presenting symptoms include chronic cough, recurrent pneumonia, failure to thrive, dyspnea, dysphagia, or acute respiratory distress, especially in infants with an upper respiratory tract infection. Differential diagnoses include asthma, croup, allergies, vocal nodules, or bronchitis. Reports estimate the incidence of RRP in the United States at 4.3 per 100,000 children and 1.8 per 100,000 adults. Infection in children has been associated with vertical transmission during vaginal delivery from an infected mother. Younger age at diagnosis is associated with more aggressive disease and the need for more frequent surgical procedures to decrease the airway burden. When surgical therapy is needed more frequently than four times in 12 months or there is evidence of RRP outside the larynx, adjuvant medical therapy should be considered. Adjuvant therapies that have been investigated include dietary supplements, control of extra-esophageal reflux disease, potent antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents, and photodynamic therapies; although several have shown promise, none to date has ""cured"" RRP, and some may have serious side effects. Because RRP, although histologically benign, is so difficult to control and can cause severe morbidity and death, better therapies are needed. The potential for a quadrivalent human papilloma vaccine is being explored to reduce the incidence of this disease.","2008","The Laryngoscope",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Munoz R. et al.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Convincing evidence of a causal relationship between sleep apnea and stroke has been shown recently in several prospective, well-designed studies. However, these studies have focused on middle-aged people, excluding the elderly population from analysis. To investigate whether sleep apnea represents an independent risk factor in this population, we performed a prospective longitudinal study in a population-based cohort of subjects from 70 to 100 years old. METHODS: Within the context of the Vitoria Sleep Project, a population-based study designed to investigate the prevalence of sleep apnea in the population of Vitoria, Spain, we performed a 6-year longitudinal study in a subsample cohort of 394 noninstitutionalized, initially event-free subjects (70 to 100 years old, median 77.28 years, 57.1% males). Demographic and polysomnographic data and known confounding factors (age, sex, smoking and alcohol consumption status, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol levels, and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension) were assessed at baseline. Hazard ratio for developing an ischemic stroke in relation to the apnea-hypopnea index at baseline was calculated. RESULTS: Over the 6-year follow-up period, 20 ischemic strokes were registered. After adjustment for confounding factors, subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (defined as apnea-hypopnea index >or=30) at baseline had an increased risk of developing a stroke (hazard ratio=2.52, 95% CI=1.04 to 6.01, P=0.04).

,"15289750"," Diagnosis of sleep apnea. ","Mattei A. et al.","Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during sleep. The prevalence of moderate OSAS (with an apnea-hypopnea index = or >15/h) is 9% and 4% in male and female, respectively. It is associated with an abnormally high frequency of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease) and excessive daytime sleepiness responsible for an increased frequency of work and road accidents. Because the treatment of OSAS provides many benefits to patients and society, it is very important to obtain an early diagnosis. The diagnosis of OSAS is based on the combination of characteristic clinical features plus compatible findings on instrumental tests in which multiple physiologic signals are monitored simultaneously during a night of sleep. A full night polysomnography, conducted by a technologist in a sleep laboratory, is the gold standard for the diagnosis of suspected OSAS, but the capacity for performing polysomnography is limited. On the basis of the high incidence and prevalence of OSAS, of the limited number of sleep laboratories, long waiting times and high costs recommendations have been formulated for the use of unattended portable systems in the assessment of OSAS. The main clinical aspects of of OSAS, the diagnostic approach with full night polysomnography and unattended portable systems, the differential diagnosis and some examples of cardiorespiratory portable monitoring are presented in this paper.","2004","Minerva medica",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"17938499"," Management of obstructive sleep apnea: A dental perspective. ","Padma A. et al.","Sleep disordered breathing is a term which includes simple snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Simple snoring is a common complaint affecting 45% of adults occasionally and 25% of adults habitually and is a sign of upper airway obstruction. Snoring has also been identified as a possible risk factor for hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. The role of dentistry in sleep disorders is becoming more significant, especially in co-managing patients with simple snoring and mild to moderate OSA. The practicing dental professional has the opportunity to assist patients at a variety of levels, starting with the recognition of a sleep-related disorder, referring patients to a physician for evaluation, and assisting in the management of sleep disorders. Obesity is the main predisposing factor for OSA. In nonobese patients, craniofacial anomalies like micrognathia and retrognathia may also predispose to OSA. Diagnosis of OSA is made on the basis of the history and physical examination and investigations such as polysomnography, limited channel testing, split-night testing, and oximetry. Nocturnal attended polysomnography, which requires an overnight stay in a sleep facility, is the standard diagnostic modality in determining if a patient has OSA. As far as treatment is concerned, the less invasive procedures are to be preferred to the more invasive options. The first and simplest option would be behavior modification, followed by insertion of oral devices suited to the patient, especially in those with mild to moderate OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and surgical options are chosen for patients with moderate to severe OSA. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AAOSM) has recommended oral appliances for use in patients with primary snoring and mild to moderate OSA. It can also be used in patients with a lesser degree of oxygen saturation, relatively less day time sleepiness, lower frequency of apnea, those who are intolerant to CPAP, or those who refuse surgery. Oral appliances improve the blood oxygen saturation levels as they relieve apnea in 20-75% of patients. They reduce the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by 50% or to < 10 events per h. Oral appliances also reduce the AHI to normal in 50-60% patients.","2007","Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Many of the factors contributing to this higher mortality (eg, alcohol consumption, automobile accident, smoking) are the same as in patients with sleep apnea, who also have higher mortality than nonapneic controls. The authors hypothesized that (1) there is a higher prevalence of sinistrality in patients suspected of having sleep apnea than in the general population, and (2) left-handed persons with sleep apnea have a more severe disorder than right-handed ones. These hypotheses were tested in a prospective cohort of 970 patients referred to a sleep disorders center because of suspected sleep apnea. All patients underwent nocturnal polysomnography and measurements of blood pressure. Sixty-one patients were left-handed. The distribution of handedness as a function of age in this cohort was similar to that in the general population. There were 486 patients with an apnea/hypopnea index greater than 10; of these, 34 were left-handed, and 452 were right-handed. Oxygen saturation, blood pressure, age, smoking history, and body mass index were similar in both groups. Left-handed patients with sleep apnea had a significantly higher respiratory disturbance index (RDI) than the right-handed ones (52 +/- 30 vs 38 +/- 35 [p < 0.005]). Right-handed patients were distributed equally among RDI quartiles, but 41 percent of the left-handed patients were within the highest RDI quartile, compared to 12 percent within the lowest quartile. Sinistrality appears to be associated with more severe sleep apnea, which may help to explain the higher mortality seen among the left-handed persons.","1993","Chest",,"Cohort",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Saito Y.","This article deals with the neurological basis of brainstem-related symptoms in disabled children. Synaptic interactions of respiratory and swallowing centers, which are briefly reviewed in this study, highlight the significance of the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) in the stereotyped motor events. Coordination mechanisms between these two central pattern generators are also studied with a focus on the inhibitory action of decrementing expiratory neurons that terminate the inspiratory activity and become activated during swallowing. Dorsal brainstem lesions in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) affect the area including NTS, and result in symptoms of apneusis, facial nerve paresis, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and laryngeal stridor. Leigh syndrome patients with similar distributions of medullary lesions show increased sighs, post-sigh apnea, hiccups, and vomiting in addition to the symptoms of HIE, suggesting pathologically augmented vagal reflex pathways. The present article also discusses the pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia in xeroderma pigmentosum group A, self-mutilation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and sudden unexpected death in Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. Close observation and logical assessment of brainstem dysfunction symptoms should be encouraged in order to achieve better understanding and management of these symptoms in disabled children.","2009","Brain & development",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A study was made of an historical cohort of 871 patients in whom OSAHS had been diagnosed by sleep study between January 1994 and December 2000 and who had been treated with PAP. Patients were followed up until December 2001. The mean (+/- SD) age of the group was 55.4 +/- 10.6 years, the mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 55.1 +/- 28.7, and 80.9% were men. To assess whether mortality was influenced by PAP therapy compliance, patients were assigned to one of the following compliance categories: < 1 h/d; 1 to 6 h/d; or > 6 h/d. Survival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves were compared with the log-rank test and the trend test, when necessary. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a time-dependent Cox model were performed to elicit which variables correlated with mortality. SETTING: Outpatient sleep disorders unit. RESULTS: By the end of the follow-up period (mean duration, 48.5 +/- 22.7 months), 46 patients had died. The 5-year cumulative survival rates were significantly lower in patients who did not use PAP (compliance < 1 h) than in those who used the device for > 6 h/d (85.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78 to 0.92] vs 96.4% [95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98; p < 0.00005]) and 1 to 6 h/d (85.5% [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.92] vs 91.3% [ 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.94; p = 0.01]), respectively. A trend in survival rates across the groups was identified (p = 0.0004). The main cause of death in 19 cases was cardiovascular disease (CVD). Variables that independently correlated with mortality in the multivariate analysis were the following PAP use categories: compliance for > 6 h/d (odds ratio [OR], 0.10; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.29); compliance for 1 to 6 h/d (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.69); arterial hypertension (AHT) [OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.24 to 8.54]; age (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.10); and FEV1 percent predicted (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98). CONCLUSION: Mortality rates in OSAHS patients who did not receive PAP therapy were higher compared with those treated with PAP and were moderately or highly compliant with therapy. A trend in survival across compliance categories was found. Patients died mainly from CVD. Categories of PAP compliance, AHT, age, and FEV1 percent predicted were the variables that independently predicted mortality.","2005","Chest","STUDY OBJECTIVES : The aims of this study were to analyze mortality in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome ( OSAHS ) treated with positive airway pressure ( PAP ) and to know whether PAP compliance affects survival , as well as to investigate the prognostic value of several pretreatment variables ","Cohort",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"15166843"," Mechanical ventilation in children with acute respiratory failure. ","Mehta N. and Arnold J.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation continues to contribute to mortality and affect long-term functional outcomes in patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Studies in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) far outnumber those conducted in the pediatric age group, and pediatric intensivists are left with the task of carefully selecting and critically appraising relevant adult data and extrapolating results to their domain of practice. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent ARDSNet study reinforces the use of low tidal volumes. Administration of surfactant is safe, but once again its beneficial effect was not sustained in a randomized trial. Surfactant proteins A and D have been shown to be of prognostic value in cases of acute lung injury. The effect of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in patients with ARDS can be enhanced by aggressive lung recruitment strategies such as can be achieved using high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). A recent adult trial shows good response rates but no significant long-term outcome benefit from prone positioning in patients with ARDS. Routine scheduled assessments of readiness for weaning and extubation may be more important than specific weaning modes and weaning criteria for children. A recent meta-analysis suggests that prophylactic dexamethasone use may decrease postextubation stridor and possibly reduce the need for reintubation in selected patients. Outcome data in children requiring mechanical support is encouraging, especially for high-risk groups such as bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients, and may guide ethically challenging decision-making for these patients. SUMMARY: Mechanical ventilation strategies aiming for optimal alveolar recruitment with the judicious use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and low tidal volumes will remain the mainstay for managing respiratory failure in children. Dexamethasone may prevent postextubation stridor. Prone positioning, surfactant therapy, HFOV, and inhaled NO are used sporadically and need to be evaluated for their effect on mortality and duration of ventilation.","2004","Current opinion in critical care"," PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation continues to contribute to mortality and affect long-term functional outcomes in patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit ( ICU ) ","Meta analysis",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

METHODS: We prospectively studied 588 subjects who underwent polysomnography from May 2000 to June 2004. Demographics, comorbidities, family history of cardiovascular disease, and the ages and causes of death for 10 strata of family members were recorded for all subjects. We excluded those subjects with known causes of premature cardiac death, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and long-QT syndrome. OSA was defined by American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria (ie, apnea-hypopnea index >or= 5). Premature CAD mortality was defined as death due to ischemic heart disease or sudden cardiac death before 55 years of age (men) or 65 years of age (women). RESULTS: Polysomnography confirmed OSA in 316 subjects and excluded it in 202 subjects. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for OSA and a family history of premature CAD mortality was 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 4.31; p = 0.031). After adjusting for each subject's sex, body mass index, and history of CAD, there was a significant and independent association between OSA and family history of premature CAD mortality (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.04 to 4.66; p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of their own CAD status, people with OSA are more likely than those without OSA to have a family history of premature CAD mortality.","2007","Chest",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Silva R. et al.","We investigated the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) while awake as well as mortality. Eighty-nine consecutive outpatients (29 females) with congestive heart failure (CHF; left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF <45%) were prospectively evaluated. The presence of SDB and of CSR while awake before sleep onset was investigated by polysomnography. SDB prevalence was 81 and 56%, using apnea-hypopnea index cutoffs >5 and >15, respectively. CHF etiologies were similar according to the prevalence of SDB and sleep pattern. Males and females were similar in age, body mass index, and LVEF. Males presented more SDB (P = 0.01), higher apnea-hypopnea index (P = 0.04), more light sleep (stages 1 and 2; P < 0.05), and less deep sleep (P < 0.001) than females. During follow-up (25 +/- 10 months), 27% of the population died. Non-survivors had lower LVEF (P = 0.01), worse New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification (P = 0.03), and higher CSR while awake (P < 0.001) than survivors. As determined by Cox proportional model, NYHA class IV (RR = 3.95, 95%CI = 1.37-11.38, P = 0.011) and CSR while awake with a marginal significance (RR = 2.96, 95%CI = 0.94-9.33, P = 0.064) were associated with mortality. In conclusion, the prevalence of SDB and sleep pattern of patients with Chagas' disease were similar to that of patients with CHF due to other etiologies.

","Dyken M. et al.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to prospectively determine whether the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with recent stroke was significantly different from that of a sex- and age-matched control group with no major medical problems. METHODS: We prospectively performed overnight polysomnography in 24 patients with a recent stroke (13 men and 11 women; mean age [+/- SD], 64.6 +/- 10.4 years) and 27 subjects without stroke (13 men and 14 women; mean age, 61.6 +/- 8.8 years). Patients with either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were entered into this study. Polysomnographic evaluations were performed within approximately 2 to 5 weeks after each patient's stroke. RESULTS: Obstructive sleep apnea was found in 10 of 13 men with stroke (77%) and in only 3 of 13 male subjects without stroke (23%) (P=.0169). Seven of 11 women with stroke (64%) had obstructive sleep apnea, while only 2 of 14 female subjects without stroke (14%) had obstructive sleep apnea (P=.0168). For men with stroke, the mean apnea/hypopnea index (+/- SE) was 21.5 +/- 4.2 events per hour, while for male subjects without stroke it was 4.8 +/- 1.8 events per hour (P=.0014). For women with stroke the mean apnea/hypopnea index was 31.6 +/- 8.8 events per hour, while for female subjects without stroke it was 2.9 +/- 1.6 events per hour (P=.0024).

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of sleep apnea after stroke and its relationship to delirium, depressed mood, cognitive functioning, ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), and psychiatric and behavior symptoms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Geriatric stroke rehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS: 133 patients (78 women and 55 men, mean age 77.1 +/- 7.7 years) consecutively admitted to a geriatric stroke rehabilitation unit. MEASUREMENTS: All patients underwent overnight respiratory sleep recordings at 23 +/- 7 days (range 11 to 41 days) after suffering a stroke. The patients were assessed using the Organic Brain Syndrome Scale, Montgomery-Asberg-Depression-Rating Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Barthel-ADL Index. Sleep apnea was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 10 or more. RESULTS: The median of the AHI for the studied sample (N = 133) was 13 (range 0-79; interquartile range 6-28). Fifty-nine percent fulfilled the criteria for sleep apnea; 52% with first-ever stroke had sleep apnea. More patients with sleep apnea than without were delirious, depressed, or more ADL-dependent. Sleep apnea patients also had a higher frequency of ischemic heart disease and had more often suffered from an earlier cerebral infarction. Multivariate analysis showed that obesity, low ADL scores, ischemic heart disease, and depressed mood were independently associated with sleep apnea. Low ADL scores, apnea-related hypoxemia, body mass index < or = 27, and impaired vision were independently associated with delirium. The presence of sleep apnea was not associated with any specific type of stroke or location of the brain lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is common in stroke patients and is associated with delirium, depressed mood, latency in reaction and in response to verbal stimuli, and impaired ADL ability. We suggest a trial investigating whether delirium, depressed mood, and ADL ability improve with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment of sleep apnea in stroke patients.","2001","Journal of the American Geriatrics Society"," OBJECTIVES : The incidence of sleep apnea and stroke increases with age ","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Whether these conditions are associated and whether excess risk may be attributed to respiratory disorders in general, rather than specifically during sleep or exercise, is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 133 CHF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or =40%. During 1170+/-631 days of follow-up, 31 patients (23%) died. Nonsurvivors had higher New York Heart Association class, ventilatory response (ve/vco2 slope), and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and lower peak vo2 (all P<0.01); lower LVEF and prescription of beta-blockers, and shorter transmitral deceleration time (all P<0.05). Exertional oscillatory ventilation (EOV), established by cyclic fluctuations in minute ventilation that persisted for > or =60% of exercise duration with an amplitude > or =15% of the average resting value, was significantly more frequent in nonsurvivors (42% versus 15%, P<0.01). Multivariable analysis selected AHI (hazard ratio [HR] 5.66, 95% CI 2.3 to 19.9, P<0.01), peak vo2 (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.97, P<0.01), and beta-blocker prescription (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.87, P<0.05) as predictors of cardiac events. The best cutoff for AHI was >30/h. EOV was significantly related to AHI >30/h (chi2 14.6, P<0.01): 78% of EOV patients showed AHI >30/h. Multivariable analysis, including breathing disorders alone (EOV, AHI >30/h) or in combination (EOV plus AHI >30/h), selected combined disorders as the strongest predictor of events (HR 6.65, 95% CI 2.6 to 17.1, P<0.01).

RESULTS: SA defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > or =10/h was found in 64 (55%) patients. Elevated CRP and fibrinogen levels were seen twice as often in patients with SA than in patients without (CRP: 52 vs. 26%; fibrinogen: 72 vs. 37%). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, an AHI of > or =10/h was independently correlated with raised levels of both of these parameters.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and fourteen consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were included in this study. Patients were screened for classical cerebrovascular risk factors. All patients received a cardiorespiratory polygraphy to determine the apnea-hypopnea index. Duplex ultrasonography was used to evaluate the carotid bulb and the internal carotid artery for the presence of atherosclerotic lesions, which were graded in 'none', 'plaques with <50% stenosis', 'stenosis > or =50% to subtotal', and 'occlusion'. RESULTS: Atherosclerotic lesions were identified in 42% of patients. These were significantly more prevalent in patients with OSA than in patients without. In multiple logistic regression analysis, this association was independent of other known vascular risk factors. Arterial hypertension, which was significantly related to atherosclerosis in univariate analysis, lost its statistical impact in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that OSA is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic artery disease that may even outweigh the impact of arterial hypertension in selected patient collectives.

Patients underwent functional assessments, including the Functional Independence Measure. Sleep apnea was found in 72% of patients; 60% had predominantly obstructive sleep apnea, while 12% had predominantly central sleep apnea.

It often presents shortly after extubation as post-extubation stridor and results from damage to the mucosa of the larynx. Mucosal damage is caused by pressure and ischemia resulting in an inflammatory response. Laryngeal edema may compromise the airway necessitating reintubation. Several studies show that a positive cuff leak test combined with the presence of risk factors can identify patients with increased risk for laryngeal edema. Meta-analyses show that pre-emptive administration of a multiple-dose regimen of glucocorticosteroids can reduce the incidence of laryngeal edema and subsequent reintubation. If post-extubation edema occurs this may necessitate medical intervention. Parenteral administration of corticosteroids, epinephrine nebulization and inhalation of a helium/oxygen mixture are potentially effective, although this has not been confirmed by randomized controlled trials. The use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is not indicated since this will delay reintubation. Reintubation should be considered early after onset of laryngeal edema to adequately secure an airway.

Mortality is predominantly determined by the total body surface area burned and the often unrecognised inhalation injury. A retrospective review of 4,451 consecutive children with thermal injuries over a 10-year period was undertaken to determine the incidence, clinical presentation, and pathology of inhalation injury and its contribution to morbidity and mortality. Inhalation burns were diagnosed clinically and confirmed endoscopically and post-mortem in 97 (2.2%) children; 77 sustained fire burns (mean age 4 years) and 20 hot-water burns (mean age 18 months). The Moylan classification stratified them into upper-airway burns in 59 children, major-airway burns in 29, and parenchymal burns in 44. Major-airway burns were always seen in conjunction with either upper-airway or parenchymal injury. Stridor and acute progressive respiratory distress were the two main symptoms, the onset of which was occasionally delayed for up to 72 h. Endoscopy was most helpful in confirming the diagnosis and determining airway management. Endotracheal intubation was needed in more than 50% of children, usually for less than 5 days, and was converted to tracheostomy in only 6. Persistent laryngeal and tracheal damage was identified in 4. Secondary pneumonia occurred in 41.5% of children with fire burns and 55% with hot-water burns. Extensive surface burns, parenchymal injury, and secondary pneumonia all contributed to the significant mortality. Post-mortem findings corroborated clinical and endoscopic evidence. This study suggests that inhalation burns were often not recognised, could present late, and usually had significant consequences. Early clinical diagnosis, supported by endoscopic findings and appropriate management, is essential if the high morbidity and mortality amongst these children is to be improved.","1999","Pediatric surgery international",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 223 patients consecutively admitted for stroke, a sleep study was performed on 166 of them (2 mo after the acute event). Thirty-one had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of less than 10; 39 had an AHI between 10 and 19, and 96 had an AHI of 20 or greater. CPAP treatment was offered when AHI was 20 or greater.

","Schulz R. et al.","The clinical spectrum of obstructive sleep apnea-(OSA-)related cardiovascular disease (CVD) comprises systemic arterial hypertension (prevalence: 40-60%), pulmonary hypertension (20-30%), coronary artery disease (20-30%), congestive heart failure (5-10%), and stroke (5-10%). During sleep, heart rhythm disorders such as atrioventricular blocks, sinus arrests and atrial fibrillation can be induced by OSA. OSA-related CVD mainly affects those patients with an apnea-hypopnea index > 30/h and, if left untreated, is linked to increased mortality. Epidemiologic data have clearly shown that cardiovascular risk is increased in OSA independent of confounding factors such as obesity and concomitant metabolic disease. In recent years, the pathophysiology of OSA-related CVD has been further elucidated showing that apart from the well-known sympathetic activation, increased oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory changes seem to play major roles. Furthermore, studies using high resolution ultrasonography have demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and enhanced atherosclerosis in these patients. Finally, animal models of OSA have delineated that daytime arterial hypertension is the consequence of the OSA-associated chronic intermittent hypoxia. Therapy of OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation exerts cardioprotective effects. It has been shown to rectify the vascular micromilieu, restore endothelium-dependent vasodilation, lower 24-h blood pressure, eliminate nocturnal heart rhythm disorders, and improve left ventricular function. Furthermore, long-term CPAP therapy leads to a reduction in important clinical endpoints such as the rates of myocardial infarction and stroke.","2006","Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",,"Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Multiple factors may contribute to the progressively declining course of heart failure. Nocturnal arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation caused by sleep-disordered breathing could be a contributing factor, particularly because it has been associated with excess mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cheyne and Stokes were the first to observe periodic breathing in patients with heart failure (Cheyne-Stokes respiration). However, relatively large-scale systematic studies have been performed only recently. We studied 42 patients with stable, optimally treated heart failure, without other co-morbid disorders: 19 patients (45%) had an apnea-hypopnea index of more than 20/hour.

The overall objective of this study was to determine whether sleep-disordered breathing and its sequelae of intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent arousals are associated with mortality in a community sample of adults aged 40 years or older. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We prospectively examined whether sleep-disordered breathing was associated with an increased risk of death from any cause in 6,441 men and women participating in the Sleep Heart Health Study. Sleep-disordered breathing was assessed with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) based on an in-home polysomnogram. Survival analysis and proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios for mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, body mass index, and prevalent medical conditions. The average follow-up period for the cohort was 8.2 y during which 1,047 participants (587 men and 460 women) died. Compared to those without sleep-disordered breathing (AHI: <5 events/h), the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in those with mild (AHI: 5.0-14.9 events/h), moderate (AHI: 15.0-29.9 events/h), and severe (AHI: >or=30.0 events/h) sleep-disordered breathing were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.80-1.08), 1.17 (95% CI: 0.97-1.42), and 1.46 (95% CI: 1.14-1.86), respectively. Stratified analyses by sex and age showed that the increased risk of death associated with severe sleep-disordered breathing was statistically significant in men aged 40-70 y (hazard ratio: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.31-3.33). Measures of sleep-related intermittent hypoxemia, but not sleep fragmentation, were independently associated with all-cause mortality. Coronary artery disease-related mortality associated with sleep-disordered breathing showed a pattern of association similar to all-cause mortality.

A retrospective chart review of patients evaluated for OSA at the VH (n=200) and at the MSI (n=103) was performed. Despite similar age and apnea hypopnea index, MSI patients had a greater body mass index, higher daytime systemic blood pressure, more comorbid medical conditions, and a lower minimum sleep SaO2 than VH patients. Systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and congestive heart failure were more prevalent in the MSI group. Forty-two percent of the MSI patients diagnosed with OSA failed to follow up for treatment compared with 7% in the VH group, p<0.001. Disparities in OSA-associated comorbid conditions, as well as in delivery of sleep medicine-related health care, were evident between the VH and MSI groups. These findings suggest that OSA may be an important factor contributing to socioeconomic-based differences in morbidity and mortality.","2004","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung",,"Cohort",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Damm M. et al.","INTRODUCTION: Acute epiglottitis (AE) continues to cause life-threatening airway obstruction in children. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate deficiencies in the management of AE, to clarify the role of airway endoscopy, and to establish the cause of death in this disease. MATERIAL: The subjects of our retrospective study were 24 children with AE treated in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the University of Cologne between 1980 and 1994. The records of all patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Laryngoscopy with fibreoptic or small rigid endoscopes allowed accurate diagnosis of AE, particularly in patients presented with atypical clinical signs. Furthermore, endoscopic information of the degree of inflammation were helpful in the critical decision, whether artificial airway was required. The number of patients managed without intubation increased (8% vs. 45%) since airway endoscopy became available in 1989. No evidence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae was observed. The most remarkable finding was the high mortality in AE (12.5%). Affected children were admitted in poor post-hypoxia conditions following outdoor cardiorespiratory arrest. CONCLUSION: The most decisive factor to decrease mortality seems to be timely appropriate presentation at referring centres, if AE is suspected or stridor remains unclear. Fibreoptic airway endoscopy represents a major step forward in the management of acute epiglottitis, and this requires close interdisciplinary collaboration between paediatricians, anaesthetists and otorhinolaryngologists.","1996","International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology"," The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate deficiencies in the management of AE , to clarify the role of airway endoscopy , and to establish the cause of death in this disease ","Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

The appropriate level of continuous positive airway pressure for each patient was determined during an all-night continuous positive airway pressure determination study. Attended continuous positive airway pressure titration was performed with a continuous positive airway pressure auto-titrating device. RESULTS: Obstructive sleep apnea prevalence among patients with ischemic stroke was 73.7%. The minimum SaO(2) was significantly lower, and the percent of total sleep time in the wake stage and stage 1 sleep was significantly longer in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In two patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea, we observed a decrease in the apnea-hypopnea index, an increase in mean wake time, mean SaO(2), and minimum SaO(2), and alterations in sleep structures with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. CONCLUSION: As the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea is of particular importance in secondary stroke prevention, we suggest that the clinical assessment of obstructive sleep apnea be part of the evaluation of stroke patients in rehabilitation units, and early treatment should be started.","2008","Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)"," OBJECTIVE : To investigate the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with ischemic stroke and to evaluate the effectiveness of nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

,"8536488"," Gastroesophageal reflux in childhood. ","Fonkalsrud E. and Ament M.","Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is one of the most frequent symptomatic clinical disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract of infants and children. During the past 2 decades, GER has been recognized more frequently because of an increased awareness of the condition and also because of the more sophisticated diagnostic techniques that have been developed for both identifying and quantifying the disorder. Gastroesophageal fundoplication is currently one of the three most common major operations performed on infants and children by pediatric surgeons in the United States. Normal gastroesophageal function is a complex mechanism that depends on effective esophageal motility, timely relaxation and contractility of the lower esophageal sphincter, the mean intraluminal pressure in the stomach, the effectiveness of contractility in emptying of the stomach, and the ease of gastric outflow. More than one of these factors are often abnormal in the same child with symptomatic GER. In addition, in patients with GER disease, and particularly in those patients with neurologic disorders, there appears to be a high prevalence of autonomic neuropathy in which esophagogastric transit and gastric emptying are frequently delayed, producing a somewhat complex foregut motility disorder. GER has a different course and prognosis depending on the age of onset. The incompetent lower esophageal sphincter mechanism present in most newborn infants combined with the increased intraabdominal pressure from crying or straining commonly becomes much less frequent as a cause of vomiting after the age of 4 months. Chalasia and rumination of infancy are self-limited and should be carefully separated from symptomatic GER, which requires treatment. The most frequent complications of recurrent GER in childhood are failure to thrive as a result of caloric deprivation and recurrent bronchitis or pneumonia caused by repeated pulmonary aspiration of gastric fluid. Children with GER disease commonly have more refluxing episodes when in the supine position, particularly during sleep. The reflux of acid into the mid or upper esophagus may stimulate vagal reflexes and produce reflex laryngospasm, bronchospasm, or both, which may accentuate the symptoms of asthma. Reflux may also be a cause of obstructive apnea in infants and possibly a cause of recurrent stridor, acute hypoxia, and even the sudden infant death syndrome. Premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome have a high incidence of GER. Esophagitis and severe dental carries are common manifestations of GER in childhood. Barrett's columnar mucosal changes in the lower esophagus are not infrequent in adolescent children with chronic GER, particularly when Heliobacter pylori is present in the gastric mucosa. Associated disorders include esophageal dysmotility, which has been recognized in approximately one third of children with severe GER. Symptomatic GER is estimated to occur in 30% to 80% of infants who have undergone repair of esophageal atresia malformations. Neurologically impaired children are at high risk for having symptomatic GER, particularly if nasogastric or gastrostomy feedings are necessary. Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) has been documented with increasing frequency in infants and children who have symptoms of GER, particularly those with neurologic disorders. DGE may also be a cause of gas bloat, gagging, and breakdown or slippage of a well-constructed gastroesophageal fundoplication. The most helpful test for diagnosing and quantifying GER in childhood is the 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring study. Miniaturized probes that are small enough to use easily in the newborn infant are available. This study is 100% accurate in diagnosing reflux when the esophageal pH is less than 4.0 for more than 5% of the total monitored time.","1996","Current problems in surgery",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

SA was considered clinically probable (P-SA) when habitual snoring was associated with an ESS of > 10 or when SDQ-SA score was > or = 32 in women and > or = 36 in men. Polysomnography (PSG) was obtained in 36 subjects (group 1) a mean of 12 days after TIA or stroke. In 23 subjects (group 2), PSG was not available (n = 11), refused (n = 10), or inadequate (n = 2).

PSG showed SA (Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI], > or = 10) in 25 of 36 subjects (69%). The proportion of subjects with SA was similar in the TIA and stroke groups (69% versus 70%) and was well above the frequency found in our control group (15%).

We conclude that SA has a high frequency in patients in the acute phase of TIA and stroke and SA cannot be predicted reliably on clinical grounds alone but is more likely in patients with habitual snoring, abnormal SDQ-SA, or severe stroke.","1996","Neurology","Although sleep apnea ( SA ) appears to be a cardiovascular risk factor , little is known about its frequency in patients with transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) and stroke ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

However, these studies either used surrogate markers of sleep-disordered breathing or could not, due to cross-sectional design, address the temporal relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and stroke. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sleep-disordered breathing increases the risk for stroke. METHODS: We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses on 1,475 and 1,189 subjects, respectively, from the general population. Sleep-disordered breathing was defined by the apnea-hypopnea index (frequency of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep) obtained by attended polysomnography. The protocol, including polysomnography, risk factors for stroke, and a history of physician-diagnosed stroke, was repeated at 4-yr intervals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index of 20 or greater had increased odds for stroke (odds ratio, 4.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-14.24; p = 0.02) compared with those without sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index, <5) after adjustment for known confounding factors. In the prospective analysis, sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea-hypopnea index of 20 or greater was associated with an increased risk of suffering a first-ever stroke over the next 4 yr (unadjusted odds ratio, 4.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-14.15; p = 0.02). However, after adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, the odds ratio was still elevated, but was no longer significant (3.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-12.81; p = 0.12).

To investigate cardiac function during the cycle of obstruction (apnea) and resumption of ventilation (recovery), we continuously measured left ventricular stroke volume (LVSV) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep in six males with severe OSA (apnea/hypopnea index > or = 30 events/h associated with oxygen saturation < 82%). LVSV was assessed continuously using an ambulatory ventricular function monitor (VEST; Capintec). The apnea-recovery cycle was divided into three phases: 1) early apnea (EA), 2) late apnea (LA), and 3) recovery (Rec). In all subjects recovery was associated with an abrupt decrease in LVSV [54.0 +/- 14.5 (SD) ml] compared with either EA (91.4 +/- 14.7 ml; P < 0.001) or LA (77.1 +/- 15.2 ml; P < 0.005). Although heart rate increased with recovery, the increase was not sufficient to compensate for the decrease in LVSV so that cardiac output (CO) fell (EA: 6,247 +/- 739 ml/min; LA: 5,741 +/- 1,094 ml/min; Rec: 4,601 +/- 1,249 ml/min; EA vs. Rec, P < 0.01; LA vs. Rec, P < 0.025).

The effects of SA on blood pressure (BP) and stroke outcome in the acute stroke phase are essentially unknown. METHODS: We studied 41 consecutive patients admitted within 96 hours after stroke onset. Stroke severity on admission (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) and stroke outcome at discharge (modified Rankin Disability Scale [mRS]) were assessed. Nocturnal breathing was assessed with an ambulatory device the first night after admission. SA was defined by an apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI) > or =10/hour, and moderate-severe SA (MSSA) was defined by an AHI >30/hour. BP monitoring was performed during the first 36 hours after admission. A nondipping status (NDS) was defined by a ratio >0.9 of mean systolic BP during nights 1 to 2/mean systolic BP during day 2. RESULTS: SA was found in 28 (68%) and MSSA in 11 (27%) of 41 patients. A correlation was found between AHI and both NIHSS (r=0.331; P=0.035) and mRS (r=0.341; P=0.031). Patients with MSSA had higher systolic and diastolic BP values during night 1 (P=0.003), day 2 (P=0.004), and night 2 (P=0.03). NDS was found in 26 (63%) patients. Nondippers had a similar AHI but higher NIHSS (P=0.004) and mRS (P=0.005) than dippers. AHI and NDS were confirmed to be independent predictors for both stroke severity and stroke outcome in a multiple stepwise linear regression model. CONCLUSIONS: SA severity is associated with high 24-hour BP values but only weakly with stroke severity and outcome. Conversely, NDS is linked with a more severe stroke and a poorer evolution but not with SA severity.

Six of them were approached by the cervical route, 5 by thoracotomy and cervical approach, 2 via median sternotomy and 3 by thoracotomy alone. Five of them required an additional laryngeal drop and 1 required pericardiotomy and release of pulmonary veins to gain additional length. The excised segments of trachea measured 3 to 5 cms in length. All were end to end anastomosis with interrupted Vicryl sutures. We have had no experience with stents or prosthetic tubes. Three patients developed anastomotic leaks which were controlled conservatively. Almost all of them required postoperative tracheo-bronchial suctioning with fibreoptic bronchoscope.

No significant differences were observed between the PH and no PH groups regarding age or apnea-hypopnea index. The correlates of PH were elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (p <0.001), body mass index (p = 0.026), female gender (p = 0.01), nocturnal desaturation (82% vs 18%), and forced vital capacity <70% (p = 0.04) on univariate analysis and female gender (p = 0.03), age <49 years (p = 0.02), body mass index of > or =26 kg/m(2) (p = 0.08), and right ventricular systolic pressure of > or =30 mm Hg (p <0.001) on multivariate analysis. Patients with PH had a lower 6-minute walk distance (285.5 +/- 122 m vs 343 +/- 213 m, p = 0.4).

The aim of this study is to identify the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and PES using the cuff-leak test in patients intubated in the respiratory intensive care unit. A total of 67 consecutive intubations on 56 different ventilated patients were included in this study. The mean age was 63.6 +/- 12.1 years and 84% of the patients were male. PES developed in seven patients (10.4%). The mean cuff-leak volume was 395 +/- 187 ml in non-PES patients and 240 +/- 93 ml in PES patients (p = 0.023).

","Shivalkar B. et al.","OBJECTIVES: We studied structural and functional cardiac alterations in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), their relationship to the severity of OSA, and the effects of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea may influence the cardiac function by several mechanisms in the awake patient. METHODS: Left and right ventricular morphology and function were studied using echocardiography before and after treatment with CPAP in symptomatic patients (Epworth sleepiness score, 10 +/- 4.8) with severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], 42 +/- 24). The patients (n = 43, 32 men) had no known cardiac disease and were obese (body mass index, 31.6 +/- 5.4 kg/m2). The same echocardiographic parameters were studied in age-matched overweight patients (n = 40; body mass index, 26.4 +/- 2.3 kg/m2). RESULTS: The patients were hypertensive (systolic blood pressure, 153 +/- 25 mm Hg), with a higher resting heart rate (77 +/- 10 beats/min, p = 0.008) compared with age-matched control patients (n = 40). There was right ventricular dilatation, hypertrophic interventricular septum, reduced left ventricular stroke volume, tissue Doppler-determined systolic and diastolic velocities of the left and right ventricle, and normal pulmonary artery pressure. The structural and functional parameters were significantly associated with AHI (p < 0.004). Multiple stepwise regression showed the interventricular septum thickness, right ventricular free wall, and mitral annulus tissue Doppler systolic velocities to be predictive of a higher AHI (p < 0.001). Six months after treatment with CPAP, significant improvements were observed in the symptoms and hemodynamics, as well as left and right ventricular morphology and function. CONCLUSIONS: The structural and functional consequences of OSA on the heart are influenced by the severity of AHI.

The aim of this study was to examine the possible association of OSA and erythrocyte adhesiveness/aggregation. METHODS: The study was conducted in the Sleep Laboratory of a tertiary university-affiliated medical center in 79 patients (age 57.1+/-12.9 years) with a diagnosis of OSA (apnea hypopnea index 41.2+/-25.9). Findings were compared with data on 1079 controls without clinical symptoms of OSA, matched for sex, age, and body mass index. Overnight polysomnography and blood sampling for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, levels of fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte adhesion/aggregation test consisting of measures of erythrocyte percentage and vacuum range on image analysis. RESULTS: The study group had significantly higher values than controls of all three markers of inflammation (p<0.001 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen; p=0.037 for C-reactive protein). Erythrocyte percentage was significantly lower in the sleep apnea group (84.05+/-15.97 vs. 90.79+/-11.23%, p<0.001), and vacuum range was significantly higher (8.22+/-7.98 vs. 4.63+/-4.05 microm, p<0.001), indicating stronger erythrocyte adhesion/aggregation.

In this study, we aimed to assess dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) during wakefulness in OSAS patients and a group of matched controls. METHODS: Patients and controls were examined in the morning after an overnight complete polysomnography. Mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral artery and mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) were continuously recorded using transcranial Doppler and Finapres. DCA was assessed using the Mx autoregulatory index. Mx is a moving correlation coefficient between mean CBFV and mean ABP. More positive value of Mx indicates worse autoregulation. RESULTS: Eleven OSAS patients (mean age +/- SD; 52.6 +/- 7.9) and 9 controls (mean age +/- SD; 49.1 +/- 5.3) were enrolled. The mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in the OSAS group was of 22.7 +/- 11.6.

METHODS: The first night after cerebral infarction onset, 50 patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) followed by oximetry during the next 24 hours. Neurologic severity and early worsening were assessed by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale and outcome by the Barthel Index. Patients were evaluated on admission, on the third day, at discharge, and at 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: There were 30 males and 20 females with a mean age of 66.8 +/- 9.5 years. Latency between stroke onset and PSG was 11.6 +/- 5.3 hours. Thirty-one (62%) subjects had SA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] > or = 10). Of these, 23 (46%) had an AHI > or =20 and 21 (42%) an AHI > or =25. Sleep-related stroke onset occurred in 24 (48%) patients and was predicted only by an AHI > or =25 on logistic regression analysis. SA was related to early neurologic worsening and oxyhemoglobin desaturations but not to sleep history before stroke onset, infarct topography and size, neurologic severity, or functional outcome. Early neurologic worsening was found in 15 (30%) patients, and logistic regression analysis identified SA and serum glucose as its independent predictors. CONCLUSIONS: SA is frequent during the first night after cerebral infarction (62%) and is associated with early neurologic worsening but not with functional outcome at 6 months.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in a series of 60 consecutive patients with idiopathic central sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index > 10 events per hour, > 50% central events) with that in 60 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index > 10, > 50% obstructive events) and 60 patients without sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index < 10), matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Subjects with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, or stroke were excluded from the study. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation among patients with idiopathic central sleep apnea was found to be significantly higher than the prevalence among patients with obstructive sleep apnea or no sleep apnea (27%, 1.7%, and 3.3%, respectively, P < .001). However, hypertension was most common and oxygen desaturation most extreme among patients with obstructive sleep apnea. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is a markedly increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation among patients with idiopathic central sleep apnea in the absence of congestive heart failure. Moreover, the high prevalence of atrial fibrillation among patients with idiopathic central sleep apnea is not explainable by the presence of hypertension or nocturnal oxygen desaturation, since both of these were more strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea.","2005","Sleep",,"Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

METHODS: Patients classified as a grade 4 Cormack and Lehane on direct laryngoscopic view, and who required more than two attempts for successful endotracheal intubation, were referred to the study by consultant anesthesiologists at four hospitals. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) data and postoperative events were collected. Patients with AHI >5/h were considered positive for OSA. Clinical and PSG variables were compared using t-tests and chi(2) test. RESULTS: Over a 20-mo period, 84 patients with a difficult intubation were referred into the study. Thirty-three patients agreed to participate. Sixty-six percent (22 of 33) had OSA (AHI >5/h). Of the 22 OSA patients, 10 patients (64%) had mild OSA (AHI 5-15), 6 (18%) had moderate OSA (AHI >15/h), and 6 (18%) had severe OSA (AHI >30/h).

METHODS: We reviewed polysomnograms and the death certificates of 112 Minnesota residents who had undergone polysomnography and had died suddenly from cardiac causes between July 1987 and July 2003. For four intervals of the day, we compared the rates of sudden death from cardiac causes among people with obstructive sleep apnea and the following: the rates among people without obstructive sleep apnea, the rates in the general population, and the expectations according to chance. For each interval, we assessed the median apnea-hypopnea index and the relative risk of sudden death from cardiac causes. We similarly analyzed sudden death from cardiac causes during three time intervals that correlate with usual sleep-wake cycles. RESULTS: From midnight to 6 a.m., sudden death from cardiac causes occurred in 46 percent of people with obstructive sleep apnea, as compared with 21 percent of people without obstructive sleep apnea (P=0.01), 16 percent of the general population (P<0.001), and the 25 percent expected by chance (P<0.001). People with sudden death from cardiac causes from midnight to 6 a.m. had a significantly higher apnea-hypopnea index than those with sudden death from cardiac causes during other intervals, and the apnea-hypopnea index correlated directly with the relative risk of sudden death from cardiac causes from midnight to 6 a.m. For people with obstructive sleep apnea, the relative risk of sudden death from cardiac causes from midnight to 6 a.m. was 2.57 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.87 to 3.52). The analysis of usual sleep-wake cycles showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: People with obstructive sleep apnea have a peak in sudden death from cardiac causes during the sleeping hours, which contrasts strikingly with the nadir of sudden death from cardiac causes during this period in people without obstructive sleep apnea and in the general population.","2005","The New England journal of medicine",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

During septic shock, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency (AI) varies between 18 à 52%, depending on the relative or absolute nature of the AI. Contrary to adults, for whom long courses of low doses of corticosteroids were shown to reduce mortality and increased shock reversibility, particularly in those with a negative synacthene test, no study provided sufficient evidence to show a benefit of steroids in terms of outcome in children with septic shock. In neonates, AI occurs frequently after cardiac surgery and the administration of steroids can improve haemodynamic condition. The recommended dose of hydrocortisone during septic shock or after cardiac surgery is 30 to 100 mg/m(2)/d. Dexamethasone is efficient to reduce postextubation stridor in children and neonate and the rate of reintubations in neonate. During croup, oral or parenteral steroids reduce clinical symptoms. Dexamethasone also reduces the incidence of severe chronic lung disease and the duration of tracheal intubation in premature infants. However the high incidence of side effects, particularly on the central nervous system, makes steroids currently not recommended for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At last, steroids are indicated for severe asthma and for bacterial meningitis. In this latter indication, dexamethasone was shown to improve neurological outcome, indeed mortality in Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis.","2007","Annales francaises d'anesthesie et de reanimation",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

RESULTS: Fifty patients had no respiratory events during sleep (non-OSAS), 19 patients had more than five but less than 50 obstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of total sleep time (mild-to-moderate OSAS group), and seven patients had an apnea hypopnea index of more than 50 per hour of total sleep time (severe OSAS group). Blood pressure, plasma epinephrine levels, and P-selectin expression (as a marker for platelet activation) were measured in every patient at 9 PM and 6 AM (before and after the polysomnogram). There was a significant correlation of the apnea hypopnea index with 9 PM and 6 AM systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with 9 PM platelet activation, and with 6 AM epinephrine levels mainly due to high values in the severe OSAS group.

","Trois M. et al.","OBJECTIVES: A high proportion of children with Down syndrome (DS) have the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Although adults with DS have many predisposing factors for OSAS, this population has not been well studied. We hypothesized that OSAS is common in adults with DS, and that the severity of OSAS is worse in DS adults who are more obese. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 16 adults with DS underwent evaluation for sleep disordered breathing. INTERVENTIONS: Polysomnographic results were compared to a retrospective sample of adult patients referred for clinically suspected OSAS. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Polysomnograms were abnormal in 94% of DS subjects. The median apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was 37/h (range 0-118). The median arterial oxygen saturation nadir was 75% (23% to 95%), and the median peak end-tidal CO2 was 58 (47-66) mm Hg. There was a significant correlation between body mass index and AHI (r = 0.53, p < 0.05). Sixty-three percent had an Epworth score > 10. The AHI and saturation nadir were significantly worse in DS than non-DS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with DS frequently have OSAS, with obstructive apnea, hypoxemia, hypoventilation, and sleep fragmentation. The severity of OSAS correlated with obesity. We speculate that the complications of untreated OSAS (cardiovascular disease, increased mortality, and neurobehavioral morbidities including daytime sleepiness and impaired cognitive function) commonly overlap with the manifestations of DS and therefore may not elicit a prompt investigation in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Cheyne-Stokes breathing with CSA commonly occurs in patients with systolic HF. Consequences of CSA, including altered blood gases and neurohormonal activation, could result in further left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesized that CSA might contribute to mortality of patients with HF. METHODS: We followed 88 patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction < or =45%) with (n = 56) or without (n = 32) CSA. The median follow-up was 51 months. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) of apnea-hypopnea index was significantly higher in patients with CSA (34 +/- 25/h) than those without CSA (2 +/- 1/h). Most of these events were central apneas. In Cox multiple regression analysis, 3 of 24 confounding variables independently correlated with survival. The median survival of patients with CSA was 45 months compared with 90 months of those without CSA (hazard ratio = 2.14, p = 0.02).

Supine sleep is known to exacerbate apneas in the general sleep apnea population. We therefore investigated the pattern of sleep positions in the acute stroke period. METHODS: Inpatients with acute ischemic stroke underwent full polysomnography that included continuous monitoring of sleep positions. Sleep apnea severity was measured using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Stroke severity was measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at the time of study enrollment by certified study personnel. Percent total sleep time spent in the supine position was calculated and compared by stroke severity based on a median split of NIHSS using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients, the median age was 67. The median AHI was 23 (IQR: 6, 47). Twenty-two patients (73%) had sleep apnea with an AHI >/=5. The vast majority of sleep time among the stroke cases was spent supine, with a median percent sleep time spent supine of 100 (IQR: 62, 100). The majority (63%) of subjects spent no time asleep in any of the nonsupine positions (prone, left, right). Median percent sleep time supine was 100 (IQR: 100, 100) in those with a higher NIHSS and 63 (IQR: 51, 100) in those with a lower NIHSS (P<0.01).

,"18927265"," Impaired cerebral autoregulation in obstructive sleep apnea. ","Urbano F. et al.","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of stroke independent of known vascular and metabolic risk factors. Although patients with OSA have higher prevalence of hypertension and evidence of hypercoagulability, the mechanism of this increased risk is unknown. Obstructive apnea events are associated with surges in blood pressure, hypercapnia, and fluctuations in cerebral blood flow. These perturbations can adversely affect the cerebral circulation. We hypothesized that patients with OSA have impaired cerebral autoregulation, which may contribute to the increased risk of cerebral ischemia and stroke. We examined cerebral autoregulation in patients with and without OSA by measuring cerebral artery blood flow velocity (CBFV) by using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and arterial blood pressure using finger pulse photoplethysmography during orthostatic hypotension and recovery as well as during 5% CO(2) inhalation. Cerebral vascular conductance and reactivity were determined. Forty-eight subjects, 26 controls (age 41.0+/-2.3 yr) and 22 OSA (age 46.8+/-2.3 yr) free of cerebrovascular and active coronary artery disease participated in this study. OSA patients had a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 78.4+/-7.1 vs. 1.8+/-0.3 events/h in controls. The oxygen saturation during sleep was significantly lower in the OSA group (78+/-2%) vs. 91+/-1% in controls. The dynamic vascular analysis showed mean CBFV was significantly lower in OSA patients compared with controls (48+/-3 vs. 55+/-2 cm/s; P <0.05, respectively). The OSA group had a lower rate of recovery of cerebrovascular conductance for a given drop in blood pressure compared with controls (0.06+/-0.02 vs. 0.20+/-0.06 cm.s(-2).mmHg(-1); P <0.05). There was no difference in cerebrovascular vasodilatation in response to CO(2). The findings showed that patients with OSA have decreased CBFV at baseline and delayed cerebrovascular compensatory response to changes in blood pressure but not to CO(2).

,"15829165"," Capnography screening for sleep apnea in patients with acute stroke. ","Dziewas R. et al.","Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a prominent clinical feature in acute stroke patients. Diagnosis is usually established by polysomnography or cardio-respiratory polygraphy (CRP). Both diagnostic procedures produce high costs, are dependent on the access to a specialized sleep laboratory, and are poorly tolerated by patients with acute stroke. In this study we therefore investigated whether capnography may work as a simple screening tool in this context. In addition to conventional CRP, 27 patients with acute stroke were studied with capnography provided by our standard monitoring system. The trend graphs of the end-tidal CO(2) values (EtCO(2)) were used to determine the capnography-based estimate of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI(CO2)). Index events were scored when the EtCO(2) value dropped for > 50% of the previous baseline value. We found that the AHI(CO2) correlated significantly with the apnea-hypopnea index measured with conventional CRP (AHI(CRP)) (r = 0.94; p < 0.001). An AHI(CO2) > 5 turned out to be highly predictive of an AHI(CRP) > 10. According to our findings, routinely acquired capnography may provide a reliable estimate of the AHI(CRP). The equipment needed for this screening procedure is provided by the monitoring systems of most intensive care units and stroke units where stroke patients are regularly treated during the first days of their illness.

Twenty-nine RA patients requiring surgery for progressive myelopathy due to occipitocervical lesions (3 males, 26 females, average age 65 years) were preoperatively evaluated. Twenty-three (79%) had sleep apnea defined as apnea-hypopnea index >5 events per hour measured by a portable monitoring device, and all of them were classified as the obstructive type. Among gender, age, bone mass index (BMI), and radiographic parameters related to occipitocervical lesions: atlantodental interval (ADI), cervical angles (O/C1, C1/2, and C2/6), and cervical lengths (O-C2 and O-C6), the ADI and cervical lengths were shown to be significantly associated with the presence of sleep apnea by parametric statistical analysis. Since there were positive correlations between the ADI and cervical lengths by Pearson's test, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjustment for confounding factors and found that small ADI was the principle parameter associated with sleep apnea. We therefore conclude that the prevalence of sleep apnea is higher than that in a general RA population that was reported previously, and believe that occipitocervical lesions are an independent risk factor for this condition. Small ADI and short neck, secondary to the vertical translocation by RA, may cause obstructive sleep apnea, probably through mechanical or neurological collapse of the upper airway.","2009","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"18923370"," Anaplastic thyroid cancer: prevalence, diagnosis and treatment. ","Chiacchio S. et al.","Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare aggressive tumor arising from the follicular cells of the thyroid gland (as does well differentiated thyroid cancer, WDTC), but ATC cells do not retain any of the biological features of the original follicular cells, such as uptake of iodine and synthesis of thyroglobulin. Prognosis is almost invariably fatal. In this article the Authors review the pathology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment options of ATC. ATC incidence typically peaks at the 6-7th decade of life (mean age at diagnosis 55-65 years), women representing 55-77% of all patients. ATC represents 2-5% of all thyroid tumors, with a decreasing trend with respect to the incidence of WDTC. The histologic patterns of ATC include giant-cell, spindle-cell and squamoid-cell tumors; these subtypes frequently coexist and are not predictive of patients' outcome. Immuno-cyto-chemistry for thyroglobulin is usually negative or weakly positive and some cases are also negative for keratin, particularly in the spindle-cell areas. ATC may arise de novo, but in most cases it develops from a pre-existing WDTC, especially the follicular subtype. Most ATC patients complain of local compressive symptoms, such as dysphagia, dysphonia, stridor and dyspnea in addition to neck pain and tenderness; in over 70% of the patients the tumor infiltrates surrounding tissues, such as fat, trachea, muscle, esophagus, and larynx. The clinical course of a rapidly enlarging mass that is firm and fixed to surrounding structures in an elderly patient is quite suggestive for ATC. Diagnosis can be confirmed by fine needle aspiration cytology or, in doubtful cases, by histology on core biopsy. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful for defining the local extent of disease and for identifying distant metastases, as is also positron-emission tomography (PET) with [(18)F]FDG. Tracheoscopy and esophagoscopy should be performed every two months, or whenever patients refer the appearance or worsening of local symptoms. Bone scintigraphy may be included in the follow-up of patients with a longer survival and relatively good health. Because of its aggressive behavior, the latest American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual classifies all ATCs as T4 and Stage IV tumors, regardless of their actual overall tumor burden. Treatment of ATC has not been standardized because it is not clear whether or not therapy is effective in prolonging survival; most patients die within six momths from diagnosis, primarily because of asphyxiation caused by local tumor invasion. When employed alone, surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy are seldom adequate to achieve overall control of the disease, but a combination of these treatments may improve local control. Surgical treatment of local disease offers the best opportunity for prolonged survival if the tumor is intrathyroidal. When the tumor is extrathyroidal, the surgical approach to ATC is controversial. Some favourable results have recently been reported with newly developed chemotherapy agents and hyper-fractioned radiation therapy. Tracheostomy should be performed in patients with impending airway obstruction when death is not imminent from other sites of disease, and if patients are not candidates for local resection or chemoradiation. Interventional bronchoscopy, including Nd-YAG laser and airways stenting are alternatives to surgery in inoperable ATC-induced tracheal obstruction. Gene therapy is under investigation. Although very rare, ATC is a highly aggressive tumor that belongs to the group of killer tumors with median survival time not longer than 6-8 months. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the conventional therapeutic strategies performed in the attempt to improve survival. Unfortunately, very often they do not succeed any clinical benefit but only palliative RESULTS: New therapeutic strategies based on molecular approaches are desirable.","2008","Minerva endocrinologica",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Apnea termination (recovery) is accompanied by the nadir of arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), changes in intrathoracic pressure, and arousal from sleep. To investigate separately the contributions of hypoxemia and of arousal from sleep to changes in cardiac function, we continuously measured left ventricular stroke volume (LVSV) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in eight subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index > 30 events/h associated with SaO2 < or = 82%) during two experimental conditions: 1) subjects slept without intervention for 1-2 h and then supplemental O2 was administered to maintain SaO2 > or = 90% (mean SaO2 nadir 92.7%) throughout the apnea-recovery cycle and 2) upper airway obstructions were abolished using nasal continuous positive airway pressure and subjects were aroused from sleep by an auditory signal. Recovery was associated with an increase in MAP and a decrease in LVSV both with and without supplemental O2. Arousal from sleep on nasal continuous positive airway pressure reproduced the postapneic elevation of MAP but not a decrease in cardiac function of the magnitude that occurred at apnea termination. We conclude that elevation of blood pressure and reduction of LVSV that occurred at apnea termination may be due to different physiological mechanisms.","1994","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)"," To investigate separately the contributions of hypoxemia and of arousal from sleep to changes in cardiac function , we continuously measured left ventricular stroke volume ( LVSV ) and mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) in eight subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea ( apnea-hypopnea index > 30 events / h associated","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Moore M. and Little P.","BACKGROUND: Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children with a peak incidence of 60 per 1000 child years in those aged between one and two years. It is characterised by hoarseness, a barking cough, and inspiratory stridor. These symptoms are thought to occur as a result of oedema of the larynx and trachea, which have been triggered by a recent viral infection. Para influenza virus type 1 is the agent most commonly identified in cases of croup. Severe cases are admitted to hospital and steroid treatment is established to reduce disease severity. Treatment with humidified air was previously widely used and is still commonly recommended as home treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of humidified air in the treatment of croup. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006) and EMBASE (1990 to January 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving children suffering from croup treated with humidified air. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently identified potentially relevant abstracts identified from the search and then assessed the full papers for inclusion and methodological quality. Outcome measures included mortality, ventilation, admission to hospital, re-contact with medical services, number of days off school and relief of symptoms; these were separately analysed for the week following treatment. Data extraction was performed by the two authors then entered by one and checked by the second author. Missing data were obtained from trails authors where possible. Data were analysed using Review Manager version 4.2. Sensitivity and sub-group analysis were not possible due to the paucity of trials. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies in emergency settings provided data on 135 patients with moderate croup for the main outcome (croup score). The combined results from 20 to 60 minutes in the three studies marginally favoured the treatment group with a weighted standardised mean difference of -0.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.75 to 0.47). No other outcomes were significantly different between the groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The croup score of children managed in an emergency setting with mild to moderate croup probably does not improve greatly with inhalation of humidified air.

,"16149210"," [Sleep apnea syndromes and cardiovascular disease]. ","Bounhoure J. et al.","Sleep-disordered breathing is very common and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia and stroke. There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive and central. The objective of this review is to provide a broad perspective of the pathophysiological and clinical aspects of the two types of apnea and to discuss their cardiovascular adverse effects. The diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome is based on polysomnography, and severity is measured with an apnea-hypopnea index that counts the total number of apneas per hour of sleep. Recent large epidemiologic studies have shown that sleep apnea affects about 16% of men and 5% of women between 30 and 65 years of age. Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by abnormal collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, snoring, vigorous inspiratory efforts causing frequent arousal, and excessive daytime drowsiness. Central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a form of periodic breathing with frequent periods of hyperventilation, and carries a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure. Obstructive apnea can also have substantial health consequences. Although the exact mechanism linking sleep apnea with cardiovascular disease is unknown, there is evidence that obstructive apnea is associated with a group of proinflammatory and prothrombic factors that are also important in the development of atherosclerosis. Nocturnal and daytime sympathetic activity is elevated after sleep apnea. Autonomic abnormalities include an increased resting heart rate, decreased cardiac rhythm activity, and increased blood pressure variability. Obstructive apnea is associated with endothelial dysfunction, increased C-reactive protein and cytokine expression, elevated fibrinogen levels and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Enhanced platelet activity and aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and accumulation of endothelial cells are common in both obstructive apnea and atherosclerosis. Surges in sympathetic activity, blood pressure, ventricular wall tension and afterload adversely affect ventricular function. Many studies have shown that patients with obstructive apnea have an increased incidence of daytime hypertension, and this syndrome is recognized as an independent risk factor for hypertension. Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Central sleep apnea is frequent in severe heart failure. Most heart failure patients with pulmonary congestion chronically hyperventilate because of stimulation of vagal irritant receptors and central and peripheral chemosensitivity. When PaCO2 falls below the threshold required to stimulate breathing, the central drive to respiratory muscles and air inflow ceases and central apnea ensues. Apnea, hypoxia, CO2 retention and arousals provoke elevated sympathetic activity, increased afterload and elevated left ventricular transmural pressure, and promote the progression of heart failure. Tentative relationships have been identified between central apnea and markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Recent mid-terms trials showed that nocturnal use of positive airway pressure in patients with the two types of apnea alleviates symptoms, reduces sympathetic activity, improves ventricular function and quality of life, and reduces daytime drowsiness. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but clinicians should be aware of this link and should attempt to identify patients with these syndromes.","2005","Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine"," The objective of this review is to provide a broad perspective of the pathophysiological and clinical aspects of the two types of apnea and to discuss their cardiovascular adverse effects ","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Assessment included body mass index (BMI); history of snoring and daytime sleepiness; cardiovascular risk factors and diseases; and severity of stroke (Scandinavian Stroke Scale = SSS). Polysomnography (PSG) was obtained in 80 subjects (group 1), a mean of 9 days (range, 1-71 days) after TIA or stroke. In 48 subjects (group 2), PSG was not available, refused, or inadequate. Groups 1 and 2 were similar with the exception of gender distribution. Clinical and PSG data were compared to those of 25 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and BMI. An apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 10 was found in 62.5% of subjects and 12.5% of controls. Between patients and controls there was a significant difference in AHI (mean [range]: 28 (0-140) vs 5 (0-24), p < 0.001), maximal apnea duration (mean + SD: 37 +/- 23 vs 23 +/- 13 seconds, p = 0.009), and minimal oxygen saturation (mean + SD: 82 +/- 10% vs 90 +/- 5%, p < 0.001). Conversely, frequency and severity of OSA were similar in stroke and TIA subjects. Multiple regression analysis identified age, BMI, diabetes, and SSS as independent predictors of AHI. Sleep apnea has a high frequency in patients with TIA and stroke, particularly in older patients with high BMI, diabetes, and severe stroke.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort and nested case-control studies. SETTING: United States Veterans Affairs medical centers. PATIENTS: A prospective cohort of 3130 consecutive adult inpatients who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty from 1991 to 2001 was retrospectively analyzed from the Veterans Affairs National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to determine the relationship between perioperative complications and both concurrent procedures and medical comorbidity. A nested case-control analysis was conducted on 43 cases with complications and 212 controls without complications from the cohort. Controls were matched on age, sex, year of operation, and concurrent surgery; this case-control analysis enabled the study of body mass index, apnea-hypopnea index, and lowest oxygen saturation, which were not available in the cohort database. Multivariate logistic regression measured associations between risk factors and complications, adjusting or controlling for age, sex, race, smoking status, year of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and presence of any concurrent procedure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sixteen specific serious perioperative complications, including 30-day mortality. RESULTS: The cohort included 3130 veterans (97% were men aged 50+/-11 [mean+/-SD] years). In the cohort study, comorbidity was associated with serious complication: the adjusted risk ratio was 1.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.18) for each increase in American Society of Anesthesiologists class. Concurrent nonnasal procedures increased the risk of complication compared with no concurrent procedures (adjusted risk ratio, 4.94; 95% confidence interval, 2.34-10.4). In the case-control analyses, the apnea-hypopnea index, body mass index, and medical comorbidity were each associated with serious complication after adjustment for confounding variables, but this study had insufficient power to determine if these risk factors were independent of each other. Concurrent retrolingual procedures demonstrated an independent association with complication after adjustment for confounders. The lowest oxygen saturation was not associated with serious complication. CONCLUSIONS: Apnea-hypopnea index, body mass index, and medical comorbidity were each associated with serious complication; however, the low complication rate precluded demonstration of associations independent of each other.

RESULTS: Less than 30% of the men had no sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index < 5) and nearly one-fifth (19%) had severe sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index > or = 30). Severe sleep-disordered breathing was associated with higher body mass index, habitual snoring, and daytime drowsiness. No association was found between sleep-disordered breathing and cognitive functioning, including measures of memory function, concentration, and attention. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-disordered breathing was associated with more drowsiness but not with poor performance on standardized cognitive tests used to screen for Alzheimer disease and other dementias in older persons. Because a healthy-participant effect may have contributed to this finding, more extensive cognitive testing may be necessary to reveal more subtle deficits from sleep-disordered breathing.","2003","Sleep","STUDY OBJECTIVE : To assess the association between sleep-disordered breathing and cognitive functioning in an elderly cohort of Japanese-American men ","Cohort",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

We analyzed long-term results of a series of DAAs, over a period of 16 years. Between 1987 and 2003, 29 children underwent surgery for airway and/or esophageal compression secondary to a DAA. Dominant symptoms were stridor, dysphagia, choking episodes, and life-threatening apneic spells (n = 7). Diagnosis was established by barium studies, bronchoscopy, echocardiogram, angiogram, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Seven patients had concurrent cardiac anomalies. Two children had an associated tracheoesophageal fistula. Surgery was accomplished by left thoracotomy (n = 25), right thoracotomy (n = 2) or median sternotomy (n = 2). The operative mortality was zero. There was one late death due to respiratory failure. Four (13.8%) patients had a surgical complication (chylothorax, 3 cases; acute renal failure, 1 case). Follow-up (mean 7.1 years; range 6 months to 16 years) was complete in all patients, and showed complete improvement in 22 patients and partial improvement in 6 patients. Early surgical repair of DAA is associated with low mortality, and results in marked symptomatic relief in most patients.

Literature on airway foreign bodies in this age group is abundant; however no study has addressed this problem in infants exclusively. This study aimed to review the clinical presentation, management and outcome of infants with tracheobronchial foreign bodies at a referral tertiary care hospital over a decade. METHODS: 102 infants who underwent bronchoscopy for suspected FBA from 1997 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Details of demographic data, clinical features, radiologic and bronchoscopic findings, postbronchoscopy events and eventual outcome were analysed. RESULTS: The mean age was 10.5 months. 8 (7.8%) were 0-6 months of age, the youngest being 2 months. Males outnumbered (72:30) females. 10 (9.8%) presented secondarily after treatment elsewhere, 6 of them were initially misdiagnosed. The onset-presentation interval ranged from 1 day to 3 months, 41 (40.2%) reporting within a day and 19 (18.6%) a week after onset. 20 (19.6%) had no history suggestive of FBA but harboured airway FBs at bronchoscopy. The clinical triad of cough, respiratory distress and stridor was highly predictive of FBA. 8 (7.84%) had no abnormal physical findings while 8 (10.81%) had grossly normal chest radiographs. All the patients underwent emergency/elective rigid bronchoscopy (Karl Storz system) under general anesthesia as in-patients. The physical findings did not always correlate with radiology or bronchoscopic location of the FB. A peanut cotyledon was the commonest FB retrieved across infancy; in 5 (4.9%) no FB was found/identifiable. 2 required postbronchoscopy mechanical ventilation and 1 a repeat bronchoscopy. There were 6 complications but no mortality in the series. The average hospital stay was 1.4 days. At a week's follow-up, all were asymptomatic and well. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of FBA in 102 infants are presented and certain peculiar features are described. A high index of suspicion coupled with a combination of history, physical signs and radiology is more conclusive than any of them in isolation.

The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of OSA in patients with symptomatic angina and angiographically verified coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition, we analyzed the association of OSA and other coronary risk factors with CAD and myocardial infarction. METHODS: Overnight non-laboratory-monitoring-system recordings for detection of OSA was performed in 223 male patients with angiographically verified CAD and in 66 male patients with exclusion of CAD. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations between risk factors and CAD and myocardial infarction. RESULTS: CAD patients were found to have OSA in 30.5%, whereas OSA was found in control subjects in 19.7%. The mean apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in CAD patients (9.9 +/- 11.8) than in control subjects (6.7 +/- 7.3). Body-mass-index (BMI) was significantly higher in patients with CAD and OSA than in patients with CAD without OSA (28. 1 vs. 26.7 kg/m(2); p < 0.001). No significant difference was found with regard to other risk factors and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between both groups.

","Good D. et al.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We objectively evaluated patients with recent stroke to determine the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and whether SDB was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with recent ischemic stroke (median, 13 days) were studied with computerized overnight oximetry for evidence of arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation (SaO2). Polysomnography was also performed on 19 patients. Medical history, sleep history, location of stroke, and severity of neurological deficit were recorded, and patients were observed by staff for evidence of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. Functional abilities were measured with the use of the Barthel Index (BI). Outcome variables included ability to return home at discharge, continued residence at home at 3 and 12 months, BI at discharge, BI at 3 and 12 months, and death from any cause at 12 months. RESULTS: Mean SaO2 during oximetry was 94.0 +/- 1.7%, and percentage of recording time spent at < 90% SaO2 was 4.3 +/- 5.7%. The number of desaturation events per hour of recording time (desaturation index [DI]) was 9.5 +/- 9.67, with 15 of 47 (32%) having DI > 10 and 6 of 47 (13%) having DI > 20. Oximetry measures of SDB correlated with lower BI scores at discharge and lower BI at 3- and 12-month follow-ups (P < or = .05, Pearson coefficients). Oximetry measures correlated with return home after discharge, but the association between oximetry measures and living at home was lost at 12 months. Two oximetry variables correlated with death at 1 year. Brain stem location correlated with higher DI and time at < 90% SaO2, but patients with hemispheric stroke and oximetry abnormalities also had worse functional outcome. No correlation was found between oximetry values and sex, age, preexisting medical conditions (except previous stroke), or severity of neurological deficit. Oximetry abnormalities were associated with a history of snoring. Polysomnography on 19 patients confirmed oximetry evidence of severe SDB. Eighteen of 19 patients (95%) had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > 10 events per hour of recording, 13 of 19 (68%) had an AHI > 20, and 10 of 19 (53%) had an AHI > 30. Desaturation events were largely due to obstructive apneas. CONCLUSIONS: SDB accompanied by arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation is common in patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke and is associated with higher mortality at 1 year and lower BI scores at discharge and at 3 and 12 months after stroke. SDB may be an independent predictor of worse functional outcome. Obstructive sleep apnea appeared to be the most common form of SDB, and the frequent history of snoring suggests that SDB preceded the stroke in most patients.","1996","Stroke","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : We objectively evaluated patients with recent stroke to determine the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) and whether SDB was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

At the time of referral, data collected included age (months), heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, retractions, stridor or wheezing, seizures, skin perfusion, oxygen requirement, and mental status. Using univariate and stepwise logistic regression, variables predictive of in-hospital mortality were selected from a training set (n = 1,111) and assigned integers based on their computed coefficients. Probability of in-hospital mortality was calculated using the total integer score and age. The risk of mortality derived from the training set was validated in the remaining patients (n = 1,142) by comparing the observed and predicted mortalities. Major interventions performed and unplanned events were determined for each of five predetermined mortality risk groups. RESULTS: Variables (integers) predicting in-hospital mortality included systolic blood pressure (11), respiratory rate (6), oxygen requirement (11), and altered mental status (11). Observed mortality was similar to predicted mortality in all risk categories for the validation sample. As risk of mortality increased, so did the performance of major interventions and the occurrence of unplanned events. CONCLUSION: Four pretransport variables predicted in-hospital mortality. Risk of mortality correlated with the incidence of major patient interventions, and the occurrence of unplanned events increased as well. This model might be useful in comparing different transport systems using severity-adjusted assessment of children requiring interfacility transport.","2001","Prehospital emergency care"," OBJECTIVE : To test the hypothesis that pretransport variables can predict in-hospital mortality that will correlate with major interventions and unplanned events during interfacility transport ","Cohort",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, a group of patients with OSA diagnosed with polysomnography between 1992 and 2004 (apnea-hypopnea index > or =15) who subsequently underwent a PCI (n = 371) were stratified according to whether they were treated for OSA (n = 175) or not (n = 196). Main outcome measures were cardiac death, general mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (severe angina, myocardial infarction, PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting, or death), and major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: Patients treated for OSA had a statistically significant decreased number of cardiac deaths on follow-up when compared with untreated OSA patients (3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0% to 6%] vs. 10% [95% CI 5% to 14%] after 5 years, p = 0.027), as well as a trend toward decreased all-cause mortality (p = 0.058).

,"18516588"," Anticipation of distress after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in the ICU at the end of life. ","Kompanje E. et al.","BACKGROUND: A considerable number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) die following withdrawal of mechanical ventilation. After discontinuation of ventilation without proper preparation, excessive respiratory secretion is common, resulting in a 'death rattle'. Post-extubation stridor can give rise to the relatives' perception that the patient is choking and suffering. Existing protocols lack adequate anticipatory preparation to respond to all distressing symptoms. METHODS: We analyzed existing treatment strategies in distressing symptoms after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: The actual period of discontinuation of mechanical ventilation can be very short, but thoughtful anticipation of distressing symptoms takes time. There is an ethical responsibility to anticipate and treat (iatrogenic) symptoms such as pain, dyspnea-associated respiratory distress, anxiety, delirium, post-extubation stridor, and excessive broncho-pulmonary secretions. This makes withdrawal of mechanical ventilation in ICU patients a thoughtful process, taking palliative actions instead of fast terminal actions. We developed a flowchart covering all possible distressing symptoms that can occur after withdrawal of mechanical ventilation and extubation. We recommend a two-phase process. Six hours before extubation, enteral feeding should be stopped and parenteral fluids reduced, overhydrated patients should be dehydrated with furosemide, administration of sedatives (for distress) and opioids (for pain and/or dyspnea) should be continued or started and methylprednisolone should be given in anticipation of stridor after extubation. Thirty minutes before extubation, Butylscopolamine should be given and methylprednisolone repeated. After this the patient should be extubated to secure a dying process as natural as possible with the lowest burden due to distress.","2008","Intensive care medicine",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

CO(2) is also a stimulus for cortical arousal, which has been linked to increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and increased mortality in CHF patients with CSA. OBJECTIVE: We have tested the hypothesis that during sleep, inhalation of CO(2) sufficient to reduce the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) would not reduce the arousal index (AroI). METHODS: In 10 male patients with CSA (7 with CHF and 3 with idiopathic CSA), the inspired CO(2) concentration was increased to raise the sleeping end-tidal CO(2) by 2-4 mm Hg during established stage 2 sleep. Each intervention was maintained for a 10-min period. Sleep stage was monitored with electroencephalograms, electrooculograms, submental electromyogram, airflow with pneumotachometer and respiratory effort and blood gases with oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO(2). During periods of air and CO(2) breathing, AHI and AroI were compared with paired t tests; patients acted as their own controls.

CONCLUSIONS: The presence of numerous SBD is predictive of ECS, independently of the presence of AHT.

","Wang H. et al.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies show that sleep-related breathing disorder (SRBD) is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with increased mortality. This study aimed to determine whether there was significant difference of subjective daytime sleepiness between HF patients with and without SRBD. METHODS: We enrolled, prospectively, 195 consecutive HF patients with left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) < or = 45% and all subjects underwent polysomnography to measure the sleep structure between 2005 and 2008. Patients were then assigned to those with SRBD including obstructive and central sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > or = 5/hour of sleep) and those without SRBD (AHI < 5/hour) according to the sleep study. The subjective sleepiness was assessed with Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). RESULTS: Among 195 HF patients, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was 53% and of central sleep apnea (CSA) was 27%. There was no significant difference of ESS scores between patients without SRBD (NSA) and with SRBD (NSA vs OSA: 6.7 +/- 0.6 vs 7.6 +/- 0.4, P = 0.105 and NSA vs CSA: 6.7 +/- 0.6 vs 7.4 +/- 0.5, P = 0.235, respectively), indicating that SRBD patients had no more subjective daytime sleepiness. Compared with NSA, patients with SRBD had increased arousal index (ArI) (NSA vs OSA: 14.1 +/- 1.4 vs 26.3 +/- 1.5, P < 0.001 and NSA vs CSA: 14.1 +/- 1.4 vs 31.3 +/- 3.5, P < 0.001, respectively), more awake number after sleep onset (NSA vs OSA: 19.2 +/- 1.5 vs 26.2 +/- 1.4, P = 0.01 and NSA vs CSA: 19.2 +/- 1.5 vs 36.9 +/- 4.4, P < 0.001, respectively), and reduced proportion of slow-wave sleep (SWS) (NSA vs OSA: 13.8 +/- 1.7 vs 9.3 +/- 0.7, P = 0.024 and NSA vs CSA: 13.8 +/- 1.7 vs 8.9 +/- 0.9, P = 0.024, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: OSA and CSA remain common in patients with HF on optimal contemporary therapy. Patients with both HF and SRBD have no significant subjective daytime sleepiness compared with patients without SRBD, despite of significantly increased awake number, arousal and decreased proportion of deep sleep stages.

","Bourke S. et al.","BACKGROUND: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves survival in ALS, but the magnitude and duration of any improvement in quality of life (QoL) and the optimal criteria for initiating treatment are unclear. METHODS: QoL (Short Form-36 [SF-36], Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index) and respiratory function were assessed every 2 months and polysomnography every 4 months in 22 subjects with ALS. A trial of NIV was offered when subjects met one or more predefined criteria: orthopnea, daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep, daytime hypercapnia, nocturnal desaturation, or an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of >10. Seventeen subjects were offered a trial of NIV; 15 accepted, and 10 continued treatment subsequently. Outcome was assessed by changes in QoL and NIV compliance (h/day). Subjects were followed to death or for at least 26 months. RESULTS: QoL domains assessing sleep-related problems and mental health improved (effect sizes 0.88 to 1.77, p < 0.05) and were maintained for 252 to 458 days. Median survival following successful initiation of NIV was 512 days, and survival and duration of QoL benefit were strongly related to NIV compliance. Vital capacity declined more slowly following initiation of NIV. Orthopnea was the best predictor of benefit from, and compliance with, NIV. Daytime hypercapnia and nocturnal desaturation also predicted benefit but were less sensitive. Sleep-related symptoms were less specific, and AHI > 10 was unhelpful. Moderate or severe bulbar weakness was associated with lower compliance and less improvement in QoL. CONCLUSIONS: NIV use was associated with improved QoL and survival.

","Aydoğan L. et al.","OBJECTIVE: Airway foreign bodies present a diagnostic dilemma and has been recognized for many years. Since aspiration of foreign bodies can be a serious and sometimes fatal problem, early intervention and proper management is vital. METHOD: In this retrospective study, the results of 1887 bronchoscopies, which were performed between the years 1973 and 2004 for the suspicion of foreign body aspiration in children, were presented. Various instruments and techniques were used over 31-year period and rigid bronchoscopy was the preferred method of foreign body extraction. RESULTS: There were 1106 boys and 781 girls with the median age of 2.3 years. Seventy-four percent of patients were less than 3 years old. The most common type of foreign body (89.9%) was organic; watermelon seeds (39.7%) were the most frequent organic foreign bodies. Eight hundred and twenty-three patients (43.6%) were referred to our clinic within the first 24h of the event while 4.5% of the patients were admitted to the hospital with the suspicion of foreign body in the airway later than one month. At bronchoscopy, a foreign body was identified in 79.1% of patients and no foreign body was seen in 20.9% of patients. Foreign bodies were encountered in 96.3% of the patients with positive history whereas 28.1% of the patients with negative history had foreign body. Of the patients with foreign bodies, 93.2% had positive history. Overall, the positive history was obtained from 85.2% of patients. The incidence of postbronchoscopic tracheotomy, thoracotomy, and overall mortality rate were 0.47, 0.15, and 0.21%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Otolaryngologists should consider foreign body aspiration in the airway in the differential diagnosis of any patient with the complaints of stridor, dyspnea, sudden onset of cough and intractable and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. A careful history and physical examination were strong indicators of the diagnosis and raised the index of suspicion of an aspirated foreign body. Timely intervention with the experienced surgical team would decrease the complication rate and mortality rate. However, prevention of aspiration with the education of parents and caregivers is very important.","2006","International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology"," OBJECTIVE : Airway foreign bodies present a diagnostic dilemma and has been recognized for many years ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Drager L. et al.","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has emerged as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, OSA is frequently associated with several risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypertension (HTN). The impact of OSA and HTN alone compared with the association of both conditions on carotid atherosclerosis is not understood. We studied 94 middle-aged participants free of smoking and diabetes mellitus who were divided into 4 groups: controls (n=22), OSA (n=25), HTN (n=20), and OSA+HTN (n=27). All of the participants underwent polysomnography and carotid measurements of intima-media thickness, diameter, and distensibility with an echo-tracking device. Compared with controls, intima-media thickness and carotid diameter were similarly higher in OSA (713+/-117 and 7117+/-805 microm), and HTN groups (713+/-182 and 7191+/-818 microm), with a further significant increase in OSA+HTN patients (837+/-181 and 7927+/-821 microm, respectively; P<0.01). Carotid distensibility was significantly lower in HTN (P<0.05) and OSA+HTN subjects (P<0.001) compared with controls. In the OSA+HTN group, carotid distensibility was significantly lower than in the OSA group and controls (P<0.05 for each comparison). Multivariate analysis showed that intima-media thickness was positively related to systolic blood pressure and apnea-hypopnea index. Apnea-hypopnea index was the only factor related to carotid diameter. Age and systolic blood pressure were independently related to carotid distensibility. In conclusion, the association of OSA and HTN has additive effects on markers of carotid atherosclerosis. Because early markers of carotid atherosclerosis predict future cardiovascular events, including not only stroke but also myocardial infarction, these findings may help to explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with OSA.","2009","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)"," The impact of OSA and HTN alone compared with the association of both conditions on carotid atherosclerosis is not understood ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Palliative care providers are often asked to get involved with ICH cases to aid with development of short-term and long-term goals.

Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status is important to discuss with families. Expert consensus states DNR is appropriate if the patient has two of the following: severe stroke, life-threatening brain damage, or significant comorbidities. The process of withdrawing ventilatory support can differ greatly from that of a medical intensive care unit (ICU) patient. Most ICH patients die within 24 hours following extubation. Symptoms of dyspnea and pain warrant use of opioids before and after terminal extubation. In addition, treating death rattle and postextubation stridor are important interventions. Family meetings are a vital intervention to help explain prognosis, establish a plan of care, and to get all family members on the same page.

Opioids depress respiration, and patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) have higher mortality than the general population. Few studies have investigated ventilatory responses to both hypercapnia and hypoxia in these patients. STUDY OBJECTIVES: We measured hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) and hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and investigated possible factors associated with both in clinically stable patients receiving MMT. DESIGN AND SETTING: Patients receiving long-term, stable doses of methadone recruited from a statewide MMT program, and normal, non-opioid-using subjects matched for age, sex, height, and body mass index were studied with HCVR and HVR. RESULTS: Fifty MMT patients and 20 normal subjects were studied, and significantly decreased HCVR and increased HVR were found in MMT patients compared to normal subjects (HCVR [mean +/- SD], l.27 +/- 0.61 L/min/mm Hg vs 1.64 +/- 0.57 L/min/mm Hg [p = 0.01]; HVR, 2.14 +/- 1.58 L/min/% arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry [Sp(O2)] vs 1.12 +/- 0.7 L/min/% Sp(O2) [p = 0.008]). Respiratory rate and not tidal volume changes were the major physiologic responses contributing to both HCVR and HVR differences between the groups. Variables associated with HCVR in the MMT patients are as follows: obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea index (t = 5.1, p = 0.00001), Pa(CO2) (t = - 3.6, p = 0.001), body height (t = 2.6, p = 0.01) and alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient (t = 2.5, p = 0.02).

METHODS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients (males 85%, aged 62 +/- 11 years) with newly-diagnosed OSA were evaluated for the presence of metabolic syndrome and the incidence of cardiovascular events after implementation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy was registered during medium-term follow-up. The diagnosis of OSA and metabolic syndrome was obtained by overnight polygraphy [with a presence of an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >or= 15] and following NCEP ATP III recommendations, respectively. RESULTS: Forty-seven (53%) OSA patients had coexisting metabolic syndrome, with increased waist circumference (98%), high blood pressure (89%) and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (83%) as the most frequent features. OSA patients with metabolic syndrome were also younger (58 +/- 11 years versus 65 +/- 4 years, P < 0.001) and presented an higher AHI (43.5 +/- 20.2 versus 34.8 +/- 17.3, P < 0.05) as compared to those without metabolic syndrome.

","Mokhlesi B. et al.","Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) have a lower quality of life, more healthcare expenses, a greater risk of pulmonary hypertension, and a higher mortality compared to eucapnic patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Despite significant morbidity and mortality associated with OHS, it is often unrecognized and treatment is frequently delayed. The objective of this observational study was to determine the prevalence of OHS in patients with OSA seen at the sleep disorders clinic of a large public urban hospital serving predominantly minority population and to identify clinical--not mechanistic--predictors that should prompt clinicians to measure arterial blood gases. In the first stage, we randomly selected 180 patients referred to our sleep disorders clinic between 2000 and 2004 for suspicion of OSA. From this retrospective random sample we calculated the prevalence of OHS in patients with OSA and identified independent clinical predictors using logistic regression. In the second stage, we prospectively validated these predictors in a sample of 410 consecutive patients referred to the sleep disorders clinic for suspicion of OSA between 2005 and 2006. The prevalence of OHS in patients with OSA was 30% in the retrospective random sample and 20% in the prospective sample. Three variables independently predicted OHS in both samples: serum bicarbonate level (p < 0.001), apnea-hypopnea index (p = 0.006), and lowest oxygen saturation during sleep (p < 0.001). Due to the serious morbidity associated with OHS, we selected a highly sensitive threshold of serum bicarbonate level. A threshold of 27 mEq/l had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 50%. Only 3% of patients with a serum bicarbonate level <27 mEq/l had hypercapnia compared to 50% with a serum bicarbonate > or =27 mEq/l. In conclusion, OHS is common in severe OSA.

,"12557859"," Acute epiglottis in adults. ","Wick F. et al.","Acute epiglottitis can be a serious life-threatening disease because of its potential for sudden upper airway obstruction. It is a well-recognised entity in children but it is uncommon in adults and therefore is often misdiagnosed. In this retrospective study we present twelve cases of acute epiglottitis in adults. The diagnosis was made by visualisation of the epiglottis using fibreoptic laryngoscopy. The illness was managed using a standardised management protocol (see Appendix). The most frequent symptoms were odynophagia (100%), inability to swallow secretions (83%), sore throat (67%), dyspnoea (58%) and hoarseness (50%). Body temperature was elevated (>37.2 degrees C) in 75% and 50% of the patients had tachycardia (>100 bpm). The supposedly typical sign of stridor was found in only 42% of the cases. A routine oropharyngeal examination does not exclude epiglottitis, 44% of our patients had a normal oropharynx and the diagnosis could only be made following fibreoptic laryngoscopy. Nasotracheal intubation was necessary in four patients. A 40-year-old man with sore throat, hoarseness, cough and odynophagia was initially seen by a physician. With the suspected diagnosis of an infection - induced exacerbation of bronchial asthma, he was treated with antibiotics, paracetamol und corticosteroids. On admission six hours later the patient was in coma. The diagnosis was not made until conventional oral endotracheal intubation (without a tracheotomy set placed at the bedside) was attempted. Unfortunately the intubation failed and the patient died. Medical management of epiglottitis in adults includes an antibiotics, NSAIDs and possibly inhalation with adrenaline. The maintenance of an adequate open airway is the main concern in adults as well as in children. Although most adults have no signs of airway obstruction, the clinical threshold for insertion of an airway should remain low, as it is the only way of preventing death. A high index of suspicion is needed to recognise this rare disease correctly and patients must be admitted to a hospital with intensive care facilities, where the diagnosis can be confirmed and intubation performed if necessary and thus reduce the mortality rate.","2002","Swiss medical weekly",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

DESIGN: A prospective survey of 577 dogs affected by tick paralysis was conducted during 1998. Forty-two veterinary clinics along the eastern coast of Australia were instructed to complete survey forms for the first 15 dogs that presented with tick paralysis during September to November. RESULTS: Five percent of dogs died from tick paralysis. Younger dogs were more likely to survive. Long coat length was associated with a greater tick burden but not greater tick size, whereas coat thickness had no bearing on either. Dogs with mild disease recovered more quickly from tick paralysis. Respiratory and gait scores reflected disease severity and were good prognostic indicators. The size of the tick did not reflect the severity of the clinical condition it induced in the host. No method of tick removal or in situ treatment improved recovery time or reduced mortality. However, the time spent in hospital was significantly less for dogs from which the live tick was manually removed. Inspiratory stridor, evident in some dogs with tick paralysis, was not related to tick attachment on the neck. The use of acepromazine maleate or dexamethasone did not reduce recovery time or mortality. Increasing the dose of tick antitoxin serum (TAS) above 0.1 mL/kg had no effect on mortality or recovery time. Dogs with severe disease that received an additional dose of TAS were significantly less likely to survive. Subcutaneous use of TAS at the site of tick attachment was of no benefit in reducing mortality or time to initial clinical improvement. A registered preventative product had not been used on the majority of dogs. Clipping the coat to search for ticks did not reduce mortality.

Children below the age of 16 years presenting with a vascular ring to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow were studied. Demographic data at presentation, including symptoms, were recorded. The ability of diagnostic investigations to identify the presence of a vascular ring was evaluated. Surgical outcomes were determined by measuring surgical complications and mortality.

One hundred and forty-eight patients with OSAS aged 17-78 years (136 men, 12 women, mean 52.0+/-12.3 years), who were diagnosed by standard polysomnography (PSG) between 1983 and 1993, participated in the study.

The survival rate in patients with OSAS was significantly lower than that in the age and sex-adjusted control Japanese population (87.6%). In the young group, only one death (a 19-year-old woman) occurred unexpectedly during sleep. The patient showed an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 33 per h and the length of time that the nocturnal oxygen saturation (SaO2) fell below 90% (time of SaO2 <90%) of 205 min. The survival rate in middle-aged patients with OSAS was significantly lower than that in the age and sex-adjusted control Japanese population (79.2 vs 91.0%), but this pattern was not seen among the aged. Time of SaO2 <90% was significantly longer in the middle-aged patients than in the aged patients, but AHI did not differ between the two groups. Moreover, it was significantly correlated with AHI in middle-aged patients, but not in the aged patients. The survival rate was significantly lower in patients with hypertension than in the patients without such complications in the middle-aged group (57.9 vs 90.4%). Cox proportional-hazard regression model including age, hypertension, BMI, AHI, lowest SaO2, and time of SaO2 <90% showed that hypertension was only significantly associated with lower survival rate in total group and middle-aged patients, but not in the young or aged patients. The prognosis in patients with OSAS may differ among the generations. The prognosis in the middle-aged population may depend on the role of OSAS on the complications of hypertension or severity of oxygen desaturation, but not on AHI only.","1998","Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Overnight polysomnography was performed on 16 male patients with chronic, stable CHF: nine had CSR during sleep (CSR group) and seven did not (CHF group). The CSR group had a higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI: 41 +/- 17 versus 6 +/- 5/hr) and experienced greater sleep disruption. There were no significant intergroup differences between age, weight, cardiac function, and pulmonary function. After the initial sleep study, all patients were maintained on standard medical therapy for CHF without supplemental oxygen or nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Over the next 3.1 to 4.5 yr there was a significant difference between the number of deaths in each group. Five patients died in the CSR group and two received a heart transplant, whereas only one patient died in the CHF group. Regression analysis revealed that mortality was positively correlated with CSR, AHI, arousal index, and the amount of stage 1, 2 non-REM sleep and was inversely related to the total sleep time. We conclude that mortality is higher in CHF patients who develop CSR during sleep than CHF patients without CSR. Although the development of CSR may simply reflect more severe cardiac impairment, we suggest that CSR itself accelerates the deterioration in cardiac function.","1996","American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"18763420"," Adaptive pressure support servoventilation: a novel treatment for sleep apnea associated with use of opioids. ","Javaheri S. et al.","RATIONALE: Opioids have become part of contemporary treatment in the management of chronic pain. However, chronic use of opioids has been associated with high prevalence of sleep apnea which could contribute to morbidity and mortality of such patients. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study was to treat sleep apnea in patients on chronic opioids. METHODS: Five consecutive patients who were referred for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea underwent polysomnography followed by a second night therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. Because CPAP proved ineffective, patients underwent a third night therapy with adaptive pressure support servoventilation. MAIN RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 51 years. They were habitual snorers with excessive daytime sleepiness. Four suffered from chronic low back pain and one had trigeminal neuralgia. They were on opioids for 2 to 5 years before sleep apnea was diagnosed. The average apnea-hypopnea index was 70/hr. With CPAP therapy, the apnea-hypopnea index decreased to 55/hr, while the central apnea index increased from 26 to 37/hr. The patients then underwent titration with adaptive pressure support servoventilation. At final pressure, the hypopnea index was 13/hr, with central and obstructive apnea index of 0 per hour. CONCLUSIONS: Opioids may cause severe sleep apnea syndrome. Acute treatment with CPAP eliminates obstructive apneas but increases central apneas. Adaptive pressure support servoventilation proves to be effective in the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders in patients on chronic opioids. Long-term studies on a large number of patients are necessary to determine if treatment of sleep apnea improves quality of life, decreases daytime sleepiness, and ultimately decreases the likelihood of unexpected death of patients on opioids.","2008","Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine"," OBJECTIVES : The main aim of this study was to treat sleep apnea in patients on chronic opioids ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

The aim of this study was to investigate the QTcD in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), and the relationship between the QTcD and (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac imaging, which reflects cardiac sympathetic activity. SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-eight OSAHS patients without cardiac diseases (mean [+/- SD] age, 45.9 +/- 10.8 years; apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 51.9 +/- 18.5 events per hour) who underwent polysomnography before treatment and on the first night of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) treatment. METHODS: Before and after nCPAP treatment was started, we measured the QTcD with computer software, before, during, and after sleep, as well as the washout rate of the MIBG administered for cardiac imaging. As a control, QTcD was also measured in the morning from 26 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Before treatment, the mean QTcD during sleep (65.0 +/- 14.6 ms) was greater than that before sleep (57.0 +/- 13.5 ms; p < 0.0001). Meanwhile, after 1 night of nCPAP therapy, the QTcD during sleep (50.6 +/- 11.4 ms) decreased from that before treatment (p < 0.0001) and was smaller than the QTcD before sleep (56.2 +/- 13.3 ms; p = 0.003). Before treatment, the QTcD during sleep correlated with the AHI (r = 0.38; p = 0.009) and the percentage of time that SaO(2) was < 90% (SaO(2) < 90% time) [r = 0.34; p = 0.018]. The QTcD did not correlate with the body mass index or the washout rate of MIBG. However, the washout rate of MIBG correlated with the AHI and the SaO(2) < 90% time.

Women with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSA) are less likely to be assessed or to receive a diagnosis, and they may have poorer survival rates. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed gender-specific differences in patients with OSA. METHODS: Data were collected with a prospective, point-of-care, anonymous 25-question survey about basic medical information and therapies for patients undergoing polysomnography at the sleep center of a US tertiary care center from January 1 through March 31, 2005. RESULTS: Of the 646 consecutive patients who received the survey, 522 (80.8%) patients completed it, and 406 subsequently received a diagnosis of OSA. Of those 406 patients, 267 (65.8%) were men. Overall mean age was 57 years (56.4 years for men; 56.7 years for women). Alcohol use was more common in men (132 [49.4%]) than in women (43 [30.90,6]) (P < 0.001). Women were more likely to have the following associated comorbidities: obesity (body mass index > or =30) (P = 0.047), fibromyalgia (P < 0.001), migraine (P < 0.001), depression (P = 0.01), and irritable bowel syndrome (P = 0.01). The 4 most frequently reported sleep-related symptoms in both sexes were snoring (279 [68.7%]), lack of energy (235 [57.9%]), difficulty staying asleep (206 [50.7%]), and daytime sleepiness (204 [50.2%]). Lack of energy (P = 0.01), difficulty falling asleep (P = 0.02), and night sweats (P = 0.01) were observed more frequently in women than in men. There was no significant gender difference in the recalled duration of sleep-related symptoms. The mean (SD) apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 26.6 (26.6) for men and 22.1 (26.5) for women (P = 0.02).

Fifteen patients with laryngotracheal injuries were studied. Blunt injuries were more common (60%). Patient demographics, mortality, average length of stay, and Injury Severity Score were similar for both groups.

The incidence of postextubation stridor in each ETT group was the major outcome measure after controlling for various patient risk factors. Patients whose ETTs were inserted in the operating room, who were less than 1 year of age, or who had ETTs in place for less than 72 hours were more likely to have had insertion of an uncuffed ETT. Patients whose ETTs were inserted in the emergency department or who were more than 5 years of age were more likely to have had insertion of a cuffed ETT. Those who had a cuffed ETT were older (mean 8.1 vs 2.5 years) and had ETTs in place longer (mean 6.1 vs 3.7 days) than patients with an uncuffed ETT. Of the 188 patients who subsequently had removal of their ETTs, the overall incidence of postextubation stridor was 14.9%, with no significant difference between the two ETT groups even after controlling for patient age, duration of intubation, trauma, leak around ETT before extubation, and pediatric risk of mortality score. Two patients in the cuffed ETT group and four patients in the uncuffed ETT group required reintubation for severe postextubation stridor. Long-term follow-up identified 33 patients (17%) who required hospital readmission. None of these was admitted with an upper airway problem. Two patients who previously had insertion of a cuffed ETT subsequently received tracheostomies for the primary purpose of long-term mechanical ventilation unrelated to any problem with the upper airway.

This paper tries to differentiate the clinical features of the connatal and classical types of PMD. Transient stridor and nystagmus were early signs in both types of PMD. Our findings support the view that the more severe connatal form shows rapid neurological deterioration from an early age leading to death usually in the first decade. In younger patients in whom the evolution is still unclear, severe feeding problems and extrapyramidal features may suggest the connatal form. By contrast, in the classical form of PMD, cerebellar signs and cognitive deterioration are more prominent with a more slowly progressive course. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were very helpful in supporting the diagnosis of PMD either in a known affected family or in sporadic cases, but were not useful in distinguishing between the two types of PMD.

","Watanabe M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea are reported to have a peak of sudden cardiac death at night, in contrast to patients without apnea whose peak is in the morning. We hypothesized that ventricular premature contraction (VPC) frequency would correlate with measures of apnea and sympathetic activity. METHODS: Electrocardiograms from a sleep study of 125 patients with coronary artery disease were evaluated. Patients were categorized by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) into Moderate (AHI <15) or Severe (AHI>15) apnea groups. Sleep stages studied were Wake, S1, S2, S34, and rapid eye movement (REM). Parameters of a potent autonomically-based risk predictor for sudden cardiac death called heart rate turbulence were calculated. RESULTS: There were 74 Moderate and 51 Severe obstructive sleep apnea patients. VPC frequency was affected significantly by sleep stage (Wake, S2 and REM, F=5.8, p<.005) and by AHI (F=8.7, p<.005). In Severe apnea patients, VPC frequency was higher in REM than in Wake (p=.011). In contrast, patients with Moderate apnea had fewer VPCs and exhibited no sleep stage dependence (p=.19). Oxygen desaturation duration per apnea episode correlated positively with AHI (r(2)=.71, p<.0001), and was longer in REM than in non-REM (p<.0001). The heart rate turbulence parameter TS correlated negatively with oxygen desaturation duration in REM (r(2)=.06, p=.014). CONCLUSIONS: Higher VPC frequency coupled with higher sympathetic activity caused by longer apnea episodes in REM sleep may be one reason for increased nocturnal death in apneic patients.","2008","Indian pacing and electrophysiology journal",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

,"12733328"," [How do you really know if the obese patient has sleep apnea?]. ","Quilliot D. et al.","Obesity is known to predispose to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition characterized by repeated episodes of apnea or hypopnea during sleep, due to the interruption of airflow through the nose and mouth. These episodes lead to the fragmentation of sleep and to decrease in oxyhaemoglobin saturation. Patients with massive obesity, with or without daytime hypersomnolence should be systematically screened for OSA, because many of them appear to be asymptomatic and unaware of their breathing abnormalities during sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) in an attended hospital laboratory setting is the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA. However portable recording devices can be used for screening with good sensibility and specificity, and even for diagnosis when the apnea-hypopnea index is high. However the final diagnosis can only be carried out in a sleep laboratory using PSG by highly-qualified personnel, because of the limitations of the portable recording device. There is a strong association between OSA and the risk of traffic accidents. It has been established that OSA affects quality of life. There is also increasing evidence that OSA is an independent risk factor for cardio-vascular diseases. This has been successfully demonstrated for hypertension by prospective studies. But the evidence remains weak for myocardial infarction, stroke or mortality. Treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice. CPAP improves quality of life, driving simulator performance, blood pressure and sleepiness, as demonstrated by randomised placebo controlled trials. The majority of obese OSA patients are currently not being offered diagnosis testing and treatment. It's a real challenge due to the epidemic increase of obesity prevalence. Portable recording devices could be available outside the sleep laboratory in nutrition department, where morbid obesity is treated.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional Study. POPULATION: Participants were 907 adults from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study (WSCS). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: CRP was measured after overnight polysomnography. The relationships between CRP and sleep parameters were evaluated using multiple linear regression with and without controlling for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) and other potential confounders. CRP was found to be higher for women and had a strong positive correlation with age and BMI. CRP showed a significant positive association with current smoking, waist-hip ratio (WHR), LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, and insulin, independent of age, sex, and BMI. Significant independent negative associations for CRP were observed with HDL-cholesterol (HDL), insulin sensitivity (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index [QUICKI]), and hours of exercise. There was a significant positive association between CRP levels and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, the measure of SDB), but these relationships were not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-two CHF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction </=35%, in NYHA class II to III, underwent clinical evaluation, Doppler echocardiography, ergospirometry, phenylephrine test, Holter recording, and a sleep study to evaluate the occurrence of CSR, expressed as percentage of periodic breathing, and apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) (ie, the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of recording).

Nonsurvivors were in a higher NYHA functional class than survivors (P<0.001) and had a more depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.03), a shorter deceleration time of early filling (P<0. 05), larger left and right atria (P<0.05 and P<0.02, respectively) and a lower peak V(O2) (P<0.05). Nonsurvivors also spent a greater percentage of the night in periodic breathing (P<0.01) with a greater AHI (P<0.03) and showed lower values of diurnal baroreflex sensitivity (P<0.05) and of heart rate variability (sdNN: P<0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed the AHI (chi2, 10.4; P<0.01), followed by left atrial area (chi2, 5.7; P<0.01), as the only independent and additional predictors of subsequent cardiac death. Patients at very high risk for fatal outcome could be identified by an AHI >/=30/h and left atria >/=25 cm2.

,"17275399"," Unique cardiopulmonary exercise test responses in overweight middle-aged adults with obstructive sleep apnea. ","Kaleth A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive nighttime obstructions of the upper airway that induce hypoxemia, hypercapnia, sympathetic activation, and arousals. This disorder induces cardiovascular autonomic imbalance and contributes to the development of hypertension. While the diagnostic and prognostic utility of exercise testing is well established in cardiology, the clinical utility of the exercise test in screening for OSA has not been carefully explored. To explore this potential application, we contrasted cardiopulmonary responses to exercise testing in patients recently diagnosed with OSA with apparently healthy counterparts of similar physical inactivity history, age, and body habitus. METHODS: Twenty-three normotensive overweight adults with OSA [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)=24.7+/-13.5 events h(-1); body mass index (BMI)=33.1+/-5.5 kg m(-2); age=45.6+/-10.7 years] and nine apparently healthy controls of similar age and morphology (BMI=29.5+/-5.5 kg m(-2); age=40.2+/-8.1 years; AHI=4.9+/-0.1) completed a maximal ramping cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance test on a cycle ergometer. Measures included oxygen consumption (VO(2)pk), ventilation (V(E)), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (Qc), and stroke volume (SV). RESULTS: Age, BMI, rest HR, rest BP, rest and exercise cardiac index (QI), rest and exercise stroke volume index (SVI), and V O(2)pk were not different between OSA patients and controls (p>0.05). Exercise heart rate was significantly lower and diastolic BP higher in the OSA group (p<0.05). In the physically active recovery (low-load pedaling), systolic BP recovery was delayed (p<0.05) in the OSA group while diastolic BP tended to remain higher (p=0.056). CONCLUSION: Patients with OSA have a distinctive response to graded exercise, characterized by a blunted HR response, markedly delayed systolic BP response in early recovery, and elevated diastolic BP in both exercise and early recovery. Clinical trials are justified to determine the clinical utility of graded exercise testing to independently inform clinical decision-making for triaging patients to diagnostic polysomnography.","2007","Sleep medicine",,"Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

The strictures were radiation induced (48), tumoral stenoses (40), anastomotic (16) and due to other causes (26). Both fluoroscopy and endoscopy were used in 58%, endoscopy alone in 23% and fluoroscopy alone in 19% of patients for placement of the guide wire. One hundred and twenty six stricture dilations (97%) were technically successful. Eighty one (62%) patients could be dilated to 14 mm or more. One hundred and nineteen (94%) patients were dilated in one or two sessions. Among the 109 patients who followed up, dilation was successful in providing adequate dysphagia relief in 97 patients and facilitated the performance of other therapies in 9 patients. Major complications included severe continuous chest pain (1 case), hematemesis (2), fever (4) and transient stridor (2). The patient with persistent pain and 9 patients undergoing other therapies required hospitalization. There were no perforations or death.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 28 patients with GJTs was performed. The diagnoses for these patients were: neurological diseases, 23; respiratory diseases, two; and gastrointestinal tract disorders, three. Twenty-three tubes were placed radiologically, four endoscopically, and one surgically. Patients' age range was between 1.5 and 180 months (mean 47.2 months), and weight at the time of tube insertion was between 2.28 and 42.7 kg. (mean 11.7 kg.). Duration of follow-up was from 1 to 49 months (mean 17.3 months). The patients were evaluated for the persistence or new development of the following symptoms: vomiting, hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, pain at the site of gastrostomy tube insertion, stridor with feeds, and dumping. Minor complications (including breakage, partial/total displacement, or dislodgement of GJT, tube occlusion, tube leakage, transient infection and/or granuloma at the gastrostomy site, and continued gastroesophageal reflux post-GJT conversion), as well as major complications (requiring surgical intervention) and mortality, were assessed. RESULTS: One or more symptoms either persisted or developed de novo in 20 children after tube insertion. Vomiting was the most common symptom, being present in 16 patients. One or more minor complication occurred in 21 patients; the most common was the accidental dislodgement of the jejunal feeding catheter. Major complications occurred in 11 patients (e.g., fundoplication in seven patients). Five patients died. Six patients had no complications; at the time of GJT placement, their mean age (93.3 months) was significantly older (p = 0.0269) and mean weight (21.3 kg.) significantly heavier (p = 0.0067) than those of children reporting major complications.

DESIGN AND METHODS: In 11 patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (mean+/-SD age 46.8+/-8.1 years, apnea/hypopnea index 67.9+/-19.1 h), who were normotensive or borderline hypertensive during wakefulness by clinic blood pressure measurements, finger blood pressure was monitored beat-by-beat non-invasively (Finapres) at night during polysomnography. Periods of wakefulness and sleep were identified based on electroencephalographic recordings. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by the sequence technique, as the slope of the regression line between spontaneous increases or reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the related lengthening or shortening in the RR interval, occurring over spontaneous sequences of four or more consecutive beats. The number of these sequences was also computed, as an additional index of baroreflex engagement by the spontaneous blood pressure fluctuations. The controls were age-related normotensive or borderline hypertensive subjects without sleep apnea who had been investigated in previous studies; in these subjects blood pressure was recorded intra-arterially over 24 h in ambulatory conditions and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by the sequence technique. RESULTS: In our patients the lowest nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation was 78.6+/-12.1% (mean+/-SD). During sleep, the number of pooled +RR/+SBP and -RR/-SBP sequences per hour was 20.3+/-2.7 per h in patients with sleep apnea and 27.1+/-2.1 /h in controls (means+/-SEM). The average baroreflex sensitivity during sleep periods was 7.04+/-0.8 ms/mmHg in sleep apnea patients and 10.05+/-2.1 ms/mmHg in controls. Both the pooled number of sequences and baroreflex sensitivity values of the sleep apnea patients were significantly (P < 0.01) less than the corresponding night values of control subjects. In the sleep apnea patients, at variance from controls, baroreflex sensitivity did not show any increase during sleep compared with its values during wakefulness (6.9+/-1.0 ms/mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that spontaneous baroceptor reflex sensitivity is depressed in severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This suggests that in such patients baroreflex dysfunction and not only chemoreceptor stimulation by hypoxia may be involved in the sympathetic activation which occurs during sleep. Such dysfunction may contribute to the higher rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality reported in these patients.","1997","Journal of hypertension"," OBJECTIVE : To assess spontaneous baroreceptor-heart rate reflex sensitivity during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome , a condition associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and characterized by marked sympathetic activation , which is believed to originate from hypoxic chemoreceptor stimulation , although little is known of other","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Svatikova A. et al.","BACKGROUND: Patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have increased risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Serum amyloid A (SAA) protein has recently been linked to the development of atherosclerosis, stroke, diabetes, and dementia. We tested the hypothesis that plasma SAA levels are increased in otherwise healthy subjects with OSA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma SAA levels were measured in 10 male patients with moderate to severe OSA before sleep, after 5 hours of untreated OSA, and in the morning after effective continuous positive airway pressure treatment. SAA levels were also measured in 10 closely matched control subjects at similar time points. Baseline plasma SAA levels before sleep were strikingly higher in patients with moderate to severe OSA than in controls (18.8+/-2.6 versus 7.2+/-2.6 microg/mL, respectively; P=0.005) and remained unchanged in both groups throughout the night. SAA levels in 10 male patients with mild OSA were comparable with controls (P=0.46). Plasma SAA in 7 female patients with moderate to severe OSA was also markedly higher compared with matched control female subjects (24.1+/-2.4 versus 10.2+/-2.4 microg/mL, respectively; P=0.0013) but was not different from male patients with moderate to severe OSA (P=0.3). There was a significant positive correlation between SAA and apnea-hypopnea index (r=0.40, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma SAA levels are more than 2-fold greater in patients with moderate to severe OSA compared with subjects with mild OSA or healthy controls regardless of gender. Elevated SAA may contribute to any increased risk for cardiovascular and neuronal dysfunction in patients with OSA.","2003","Circulation",,"Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Recently, reimplantation of the innominate artery has been advocated as a superior operative procedure. While generally successful, arterial transfer carries the risk of early bleeding and stroke, and the potential for late stenosis at the anastomotic site. Between 1969 and 1994, 25 infants and children at our institution received diagnoses of innominate artery compression and were treated by anterior suspension. All presented with stridor and one third had a history of suspected or proven apnea. Twenty-four children had excellent results, while 1 required resuspension after stridor returned.

","Paxton L. et al.","To help reduce paediatric morbidity and mortality in the developing world, WHO has developed a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that targets the principal causes of death in children, which include acute respiratory infection, malaria, measles, diarrhoeal disease, and malnutrition. With this algorithm, known as the Sick Child Charts, severely ill children are rapidly identified, through the presence of any one of 13 signs indicative of severe illness, and referred for more intensive health care. These signs are the inability to drink, abnormal mental status (abnormally sleepy), convulsions, wasting, oedema, chest wall retraction, stridor, abnormal skin turgor, repeated vomiting, stiff neck, tender swelling behind the ear, pallor of the conjunctiva, and corneal ulceration. The usefulness of these signs, both in current clinical practice and within the optimized context of the Sick Child Chart algorithm in a rural district of western Kenya, was evaluated. We found that 27% of children seen in outpatient clinics had one or more of these signs and that pallor and chest wall retraction were the signs most likely to be associated with hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) = 8.6 and 5.3, respectively). Presentation with any of these signs led to a 3.2 times increased likelihood of admission, although 54% of hospitalized children had no such signs and 21% of children sent home from the outpatient clinic had at least one sign. Among inpatients, 58% of all children and 89% of children who died had been admitted with a sign. Abnormal mental status was the sign most highly associated with death (OR = 59.6), followed by poor skin turgor (OR = 5.6), pallor (OR = 4.3), repeated vomiting (OR = 3.6), chest wall retraction (OR = 2.7), and oedema (OR = 2.4). Overall, the mortality risk associated with having at least one sign was 6.5 times higher than that for children without any sign. While these signs are useful in identifying a subset of children at high risk of death, their validation in other settings is needed. The training and supervision of health workers to identify severely ill children should continue to be given high priority because of the benefits, such as reduction of childhood mortality.","1996","Bulletin of the World Health Organization",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

To analyse the clinical presentation, use of various diagnostic techniques, treatment and follow-up we carried out a retrospective study of 38 children who had been diagnosed with a vascular ring between 1981 and 1996. We found 74% of the vascular rings to be symptomatic, with inspiratory stridor and wheezing as the main complaints. The delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of a vascular ring in patients without associated anomalies ranged from 1 to 84 mo. Associated anomalies were found in 53% of cases and 80% of these anomalies consisted of associated cardiovascular malformations. Oesophagography proved to be a valuable diagnostic technique when a vascular ring was suspected. Echocardiography appeared to be of little value for the diagnosis of a vascular ring, but was essential to exclude associated cardiovascular malformations. Although angiography has always been considered to be the gold standard in the determination of the exact anatomy of vascular rings, increasing evidence is available that CT scan or MRI may replace this role. Mortality was related to co-existent tracheal deformities in 5/6 cases. Of the remaining, preoperatively symptomatic patients, relief of symptoms was achieved immediately after surgery in 43% and within 4 y after surgery in 57%.

METHODS: The records of 32 patients from 1988 to 2002 were reviewed. Mean age was 22.3 years (range: 4-53). Three patients were female. Prominent symptoms were dyspnea, subcutaneous air and pneumothorax in chest X-rays. Associated injuries were seen in 22 patients (68.7%): most frequently in the lung parenchyma (11 patients) and esophagus (seven patients). Bronchoscopic detection of a rupture of the trachea or bronchus was the main indication for surgery. RESULTS: Nineteen injuries (59%) were penetrating and 13 blunt (41%). The most common presenting sign of airway disruption was subcutaneous emphysema (25%) and stridor (22%). Of the 32 patients, 22 underwent bronchoscopic examination. Bronchography was used in three patients admitted during the late period. Surgical morbidity was 19.3%. Seven patients died (21.8%), of whom six had been operated on.

However, susceptible ICU populations are poorly defined. Clinical recognition of HSV infection of the respiratory tract is difficult and the impact of such reactivation is not understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of HSV-1 positive patients encountered over a 5-year period at a multispecialty ICU was carried out. HSV-1 was identified in respiratory secretions using a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical features that would typify HSV-1 respiratory involvement, and the morbidity and mortality risks found with HSV-1 respiratory involvement. RESULTS: A review of 48 HSV-1 positive ICU patients showed that patients reactivating HSV in the respiratory tract fell into one of the three categories: (1) septic elderly patients with and without ARDS, (2) immunosuppressed patients, especially those receiving high-dose steroids, and (3) post-thoracotomy patients. Abnormalities suggestive of HSV-1 reactivation in the respiratory tract included, haemorrhagic or excessive respiratory secretions, concomitant orofacial herpes (42%), and bronchoscopic abnormalities (hemorrhagic ulcers and mucosal friability) (83%). Twenty eight percent of the HSV-1 infected patients experienced postextubation stridor. HSV-1 reactivation was associated with extended ventilator stays, significant mortality (42%), and ventilator-associated pneumonias (52%). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of susceptible populations and definition of clinical features of HSV-1 related respiratory disease can enable diagnosis of HSV-1 infection in ICU patients.

","Bassetti C. et al.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although recent studies suggest a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with acute stroke, a systematic characterization of sleep-disordered breathing based on the severity and topography of stroke has not been performed. METHODS: We prospectively studied 39 noncomatose adult subjects (15 women, 24 men; mean age, 57 years) with a first acute stroke. Sleep history, cardiovascular risk factors, stroke severity as estimated by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, and extent of stroke demonstrated on a computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain were assessed. Polysomnography was performed a mean of 10 days (range, 1 to 49 days) after stroke onset. Monitoring of breathing during wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep included measurements of nasal/oral airflow, respiratory effort, and oxygen saturation. RESULTS: Breathing was abnormal during wakefulness in 7 (18%) subjects and during sleep in 26 (67%). Obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index > 10) was found in 14 subjects, Cheyne-Stokes-like breathing was observed in 4, and a combination of obstructive sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes-like breathing was observed in 7. Sustained tachypnea and ataxic breathing were rare.

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively investigate cardiovascular outcomes in treated versus untreated patients with OSA. METHODS: Consecutive sleep laboratory patients with all degrees of OSA were included. Endpoints were nonfatal (myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome requiring revascularization procedures) and fatal (death from myocardial infarction or stroke) cardiovascular events. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Comparison of event-free survival rates in treated versus untreated patients (Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank test). Of 449 patients enrolled (age, 56.0 +/- 10.5 years; body mass index, 30.8 +/- 5.4 kg/m(2)), 364 patients received OSA treatment, and 85 patients remained untreated.

","Zevin S. et al.","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by disordered breathing and associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. A factor in the pathogenesis of OSA is hypotonia of the upper airway muscles during sleep, resulting in occlusion of the upper airway. Nicotine may be a suitable drug because it is a stimulant of breathing and activity of oropharyngeal muscles. A novel delivery system, a nicotine tooth patch (NTP) that releases nicotine continuously, has been developed by Perio Products (Jerusalem, Israel). A 2-mg NTP achieved low plasma levels of nicotine with high saliva levels (62 microg/mL), presumably resulting in high nicotine levels in the oropharynx. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two doses of NTP, 2 mg and 4 mg, on the clinical features in OSA. Ten subjects with OSA were admitted overnight and monitored by polysomnography at baseline and during two treatments. The treatments were blind and in a randomized order. After a 4.3-mg NTP, T(max) was 40 +/- 16 minutes, C(max) was 123 +/- 43 microg/mL, and terminal T(1/2) was 29 +/- 11 minutes in saliva. Substantial nicotine levels persisted in saliva for approximately 4 hours.

In the closed injury group, seven patients (88%) had tracheostomy with upper endoscopy, and two of them (25%) had neck exploration in addition. One patient (13%), however, developed glottic stenosis. The patients with stenosis underwent multiple surgical interventions prior to final decannulation. There was no mortality. Breathing difficulty/stridor were the commonest clinical presentations in children with acute external laryngotracheal trauma. Tracheostomy and early surgical intervention appeared to be the treatment of choice.

Till recently, the outlook for these patients was dismal because medical management was the only way of treatment. Surgical and endoscopical techniques developed in the last years have improved the prognosis. We review the short- and long-term outcomes of a single institution experience in the management of children with CTS, comparing different treatment modalities. METHODS: Between 1991 and 2004, 19 cases of CTS have been managed in our Unit. Respiratory symptoms varied from mild stridor on exertion to severe distress. Bronchoscopy was performed for diagnostic purposes in all cases; other imaging techniques (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bronchography, angiography, doppler-ultrasound) were performed on an individual basis. According to clinical and endoscopical features, patients were classified into three groups. The following data have been studied in each case: sex, age at diagnosis and treatment, anatomical type, associated anomalies, treatment modality, complications, outcome and time of follow-up. RESULTS: Ten boys and nine girls have been included in this study. Age at diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 7 years (median, 4 months) and 84% of cases showed associated anomalies. Five patients presented mild or no symptoms and have been managed expectantly. The other 14 cases were operated on because of persistent or severe clinical symptoms. The following procedures were performed: slide tracheoplasty (n = 7), costal cartilage tracheoplasty (n = 5), tracheal resection and reconstruction (n = 3), endoscopical dilatation (n = 3), stent placement (n = 1), and laser resection (n = 1). Three patients required two or more procedures and surgical survival rate is 78%. Overall mortality in the series is 21% and all survivors (15 patients) are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms with respiratory infections only. Follow-up is complete, ranging from 8 months to 12.3 years (mean, 5 years). CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy is our preferred diagnostic tool. Selection of the type of treatment depends on the patient's clinical status and the anatomical pattern of the stenosis. In symptomatic cases with short-segment stenosis (<30% of total tracheal length), we prefer tracheal resection with end-to-end anastomosis; for long-segment stenosis (>30%), slide tracheoplasty is our procedure of choice.","2006","European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery"," OBJECTIVE : Congenital tracheal stenosis ( CTS ) is a very infrequent malformation ","Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Goudy S. et al.","OBJECTIVE: To determine safe criteria for the management of patients with crepitance of the neck. HYPOTHESIS: Upper aerodigestive tract injury may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Historically, this kind of injury has been managed by immediate surgical exploration, repair, and drainage. More recently, a nonoperative approach has been advocated. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the University of Louisville Trauma Center with suspected upper aerodigestive tract injury. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 236 patients admitted to the trauma service from 1995 to 1999 with the diagnosis of aerodigestive tract injury or subcutaneous emphysema. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were identified with cervical emphysema or cervical crepitance, or both, thought to be caused by an upper aerodigestive tract injury. The average patient age was 38.5 years; 68% of patients were men. The mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle accident (43%), gunshot wound (37%), assault (10%), blunt neck trauma (5%), and stabbing (5%). Each patient presented with cervical emphysema shown by radiograph or crepitance, or both; 21% had dysphagia and 63% were hoarse or had stridor. Location of the injury was tracheal or laryngeal in 37%, hypopharyngeal in 27%, oral pharynx in 16%, esophageal in 5%, and unidentified in 15% of patients. Because of suspected aerodigestive tract injury, 79% of patients were taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy and esophagoscopy, and abnormalities were found in 80%. The diameter of the average laceration of the upper aerodigestive tract was 1.6 cm. Associated injuries included mandible fractures in 37% of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were given to 95% of the patients. The initial management involved immediate surgical exploration in 55% of the total number of patients, with 83% of the surgically explored patients undergoing tracheotomy. The remaining 45% of patients were managed without surgery. Complications occurred only in operative patients, with aspiration occurring in 10%, bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis in 5%, and vocal cord paralysis in 5%. None of the patients developed postinjury or operative abscess. CONCLUSION: The findings show that suspected upper aerodigestive tract injury can be managed without surgery but that a high index of suspicion for airway compromise and associated facial injuries must be considered.","2002","The Laryngoscope"," OBJECTIVE : To determine safe criteria for the management of patients with crepitance of the neck ","Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

The ages of the seven females and three males were bimodal, the median age of the seven children was 29 days (range 1 day-6 years); it was 32 years (range 28-39) for the three adults. One child was delivered by cesarean section for fetal distress and another was born at 29 weeks gestation. Symptoms included: recurrent pneumonia (5), respiratory distress (5), hemoptysis (2), stridor (1), and pleuritis (1). Chest radiographs were consistent with sequestration in seven patients and diaphragmatic hernia in another, but incorrectly diagnosed one diaphragmatic eventration and one pulmonary varix. Computed tomographs suggested sequestration in five patients, but mistakenly interpreted a pulmonary varix in one case. Angiography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were infrequent investigative studies and yielded variable results. All patients underwent thoracotomy and lobectomy without morbidity or mortality. Five had intralobar and five had extralobar sequestration. All adults had intralobar sequestration. Two had aberrant subdiaphragmatic arterial vessels. Eight had vessels originating from the descending thoracic aorta. Nine patients are asymptomatic at six months to 10 years follow up. The 29-week-old premature infant died 30 days postoperatively due to necrotizing enterocolitis. Pulmonary sequestration remains an uncommon entity. The radiologic investigations that provide the most information are the chest radiography and computed tomography. Definitive diagnosis is made at thoracotomy.

The small size of previously proposed models has limited the development of innovative reconstructive techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven of 15 post-weanling commercial piglets underwent injury by a sharpened metal rod to the anterior half of the subglottic region at repeated intervals under endoscopic guidance. Four of 15 animals did not undergo injury and served as control for normal subglottic growth over time. Each airway was sized by endotracheal tube (ETT) passage and endoscopic photography over time, and the degree of total stenosis was estimated in comparison to the control animals. RESULTS: The first two animals underwent daily injury and expired from copious granulation tissue. Eight additional animals developed symptomatic subglottic stenosis manifested by audible stridor and intercostal retractions while undergoing injury every third day. Photographs documented the size of the stenosis to be greater than 50% (40% by ETT sizing) with a mean of three injuries in a mean time of 18 days.

DESIGN: Prospective study. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients (mean age, 73.2 years; SD, 12.8 years) were studied. Clinical sleep and neurologic data and vascular risk factors were recorded. Two nocturnal studies using a portable autotitration device (AutoSet Portable Plus II system; ResMed; Sydney, NSW, Australia) were performed in both the acute phase (mean duration, 1.23 days; SD, 0.7 day) and the stable phase (mean duration 65.9 days; SD, 12.5 days) of the neurologic event in all patients. RESULTS: The mean total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) measured with the autotitration device in the acute phase was 34.9 (SD, 25.2) vs 20.1 (SD, 21.7) in the stable phase, both with predominance of obstructive apnea. Patients with dysphagia (n = 30) showed the largest number of obstructive apneic episodes (OAIs) in the acute phase (AHI, 40 episodes; OAI, 30.4 episodes), with a significant reduction in this type of apnea during the stable phase of stroke (AHI, 24.7 episodes; OAI, 17.7 episodes), coinciding with the recovery of pharyngeal muscle function.

To this end, a prospective longitudinal study was conducted in the elderly population consisting of 80 patients of either sex over the age of 65 years admitted to a city hospital in Germany without any history of SDB. All patients met the following exclusion criteria: age <65 yr, heart failure, and chronic obstructive lung disease. Baseline anthropometric and cardiorespiratory (one-night portable polygraphic recording) data, and a standardized sleep and sleepiness-questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS) were obtained in 1999. A second screening was conducted in 2003. Thirty one women and 34 men completed the follow-up after 3 years. These patients were divided into two subgroups: (i) no clinically relevant SDB and (ii) SDB (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI, >or=5 plus excessive day time sleepiness, ESS, >9). Six men and 3 women fulfilled the criteria of SDB. Thirty three percent of patients with SDB and 20% of patients without SDB died during the follow-up period. Duration of hospital stay was 35 days for the SDB patients and 20 days for patients without it. Body weight and sleepiness did not change significant over the 3-year period between the two cohorts. We conclude that the presence of SDB was associated with a 1.5-fold higher mortality and longer hospital stay in elderly patients over a period of 3 years even in persons without previous history of SDB.

","Carneiro G. et al.","BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with several conditions that could facilitate the onset of cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunctions. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has been shown to improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality related to OSA, but the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether sleep apnea contributes to insulin resistance and inflammatory marker alterations and to evaluate the benefits of nasal CPAP therapy in severe obese patients with OSA. METHODS: Plasma inflammatory cytokines and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR, Insulin Sensitivity Index [ISI]) were measured in severe obese male with OSA (n = 16) and compared with body mass index (BMI)-matched male controls without OSA (n = 13). Seven patients with severe sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index >30 events/h) were reevaluated after 3 months of nasal CPAP therapy. RESULTS: OSA patients had a significantly lower adiponectin levels than obese controls (8.7 +/- 1.18 ng/mL vs. 15.0 +/- 2.55 ng/mL, P = 0.025). HOMA-IR, ISI, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were not different between groups. Although insulin resistance index and BMI values did not change after 3 months of nCPAP therapy, adiponectin levels increased (P = 0.036) and the levels of TNF-alpha tended to decrease (P = 0.065). Changes in adiponectin levels during nCPAP therapy were positively correlated with an improvement in minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.773; P = 0.041) and negatively correlated with changes in TNF-alpha levels (r = -0.885; P = 0.008).

The effects of OSAS severity and nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on daytime baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and nitric oxide (NO) production were investigated in OSAS patients. Fifty-one consecutive males with OSAS and 29 age-matched healthy men underwent the Valsalva test and standard polysomnography. Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of >or=20 episodes per hour were randomized to receive CPAP treatment for 3 months (n=14) or no such treatment (n=19). The BRS index measured from the overshoot phase (phase IV) of the Valsalva maneuver and plasma NO concentration were significantly lower, whereas the AHI, oxygen desaturation time, arousal index, percentage of sleep stage 1, and systolic blood pressure were significantly greater, in patients with an AHI of >or=20/h than in those with an AHI of <20/h or in controls. The 24-h urinary excretion of norepinephrine was significantly reduced and the plasma NO concentration was significantly increased after one night of CPAP. The BRS index for phase IV and the Valsalva ratio were significantly increased in the CPAP group after the 3-month treatment period but remained unchanged in the non-CPAP group of OSAS patients. The daytime BRS index and NO production were thus inversely related to the severity of OSAS, and successful CPAP treatment improved these parameters in patients with moderate to severe OSAS.

The two most common forms are double aortic arch and right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery and a left-sided ligamentum arteriosum. Patients may present with symptoms of airway or esophageal impingement, including ""noisy breathing,"" stridor, respiratory distress, difficulty feeding, or dysphagia. Typically, the more severe the airway or esophageal compression, the earlier the age at presentation. Diagnosis was traditionally made by posterior compression of the esophagus demonstrated by barium swallow; in the current era, CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography is used. Although helpful to delineate intracardiac anatomy and associated structural heart defects, echocardiography is less useful for imaging vascular structures when atretic segments comprise part of the vascular ring. Management includes surgical division of the structures contributing to the vascular ring. Some centers also perform surgical remodeling of Kommerell's diverticulum because this structure may contribute to continuing tracheal or esophageal compression even after the ring has been released. Patients with associated tracheomalacia may continue to have symptoms that can last for months, but ultimately resolve with time.

Serum CRP values were increased in both group 1 and group 2 when compared with control subjects (p < 0.05). Serum homocysteine values were higher in group 1 than in control subjects (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that OSA syndrome is associated not only with slight hyperhomocysteinemia but also with increased CRP concentrations. Increased plasma concentrations of homocysteine and CRP can be useful in clinical practice to be predictor of long-term prognosis for cardiovascular disease and the treatment of OSA.","2006","Chest"," OBJECTIVES : The aims of this study were to determine whether OSA is associated with serum cardiac risk markers and to investigate the relationship between them ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Rosbe K. et al.","OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published literature describing the association between reflux and upper airway symptoms in children. DESIGN: Structured MEDLINE search of English-language articles published since 1966. SUBJECTS: We selected articles examining reflux in conjunction with stridor, apnea, sudden infant death syndrome, life-threatening events, and laryngomalacia. Studies that focused on lower airway symptoms or adults were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Articles were abstracted for patient factors, elements of study design, methods of reflux diagnosis, and definition of pathologic reflux. RESULTS: Ninety-nine articles were identified, 56 of which specifically examined reflux and upper respiratory symptoms in children. Of these, 10 compared reflux incidence in symptomatic patients and a set of predetermined control patients, while the remainder reported prevalence data only. Overall, symptomatic patients were diagnosed with reflux frequently, with a range from 27% to 100%. In studies that attempted to compare patients with controls, only 2 provided statistical comparisons of the patient groups, and none adjusted for confounding owing to study design. There was marked heterogeneity in methods used to diagnose reflux in the studies reviewed, with only 34% using dual-channel pH testing; definitions of pathologic reflux were also variable. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence seems to support the hypothesis that reflux is associated with upper airway symptoms in children. However, the strength of this correlation and the risk of upper airway symptoms attributable to reflux are difficult to determine given the limitations of available literature. Future research studies should seek standard reflux testing methods, clear comparison groups, and more rigorous statistical methods.","2003","Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery"," OBJECTIVE : To systematically review published literature describing the association between reflux and upper airway symptoms in children ","Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"12753354"," Association of right ventricular dysfunction and Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with chronic heart failure. ","Christ M. et al.","Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is present in up to 40% of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and is an independent risk factor for increased overall mortality. We examined whether CSR is associated with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in CHF patients. Parameters of RV function were assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography and tissue velocity imaging in 42 patients (aged 23-75 years) with a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction below 40%. Respiratory polygraphy revealed CSR with an central apnea-hypopnea index (CAHI) >10 h-1 in 13 of the 42 patients (31%). Demographic characteristics did not differ among the patient groups. The velocity of the tricuspid annular systolic motion (TASM), a parameter reflecting systolic RV function, was significantly reduced in CHF patients with CSR (10.5 +/- 2.3 cm s-1) compared with those without CSR (15.0 +/- 5.1 cm s-1, P = 0.004), and was inversely associated with the CAHI (y = 15.2-0.2x; r = 0.46, P = 0.003). The RV dimensions were significantly increased and the fractional RV area changes significantly reduced in CHF patients with CSR (33 +/- 17 versus 48 +/- 20%; P = 0.04). Doppler parameters of pulmonary artery flow indicate higher pulmonary artery pressures in CSR patients compared with patients without CSR, which is also reflected by an increased RV free-wall thickness in CSR patients (6.5 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.3 +/- 1.3 mm; P = 0.05). Parameters of systolic LV function, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and PaO2 and PaCO2 were not different among patients with or without CSR. In conclusion, CSR is associated with depressed systolic RV function and increased RV dimensions in CHF patients. Future studies will show whether optimized treatment of CSR will improve RV function.","2003","Journal of sleep research",,"Cohort",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
,"18635479"," Postoperative hypoxemia in morbidly obese patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. ","Ahmad S. et al.","INTRODUCTION: The increased incidence of morbid obesity has resulted in an increase of bariatric surgical procedures. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a commonly encountered comorbidity in morbidly obese patients. Sedatives, analgesics, and anesthetics alter airway tone, and airway obstruction and death have been reported in patients with OSA after minimal doses of sedatives and anesthetics, yet there is a lack of consensus regarding the care of these patients. In this study, we sought to determine whether obese patients with polysomnography-confirmed diagnosis of OSA were at significantly greater risk for postoperative hypoxemic episodes in the first 24 h after laparoscopic bariatric surgery than morbidly obese patients without a diagnosis of OSA. METHODS: Adult subjects (Body Mass Index, 35-75 kg/m(2)) scheduled to undergo laparoscopic bariatric surgery were studied. A finger pulse oximetry probe was placed preoperatively and oxygen saturation (Spo(2)) was recorded continuously. All subjects underwent preoperative polysomnography testing within 4 wk of surgery. Anesthetic management was standardized, using propofol for induction and desflurane and remifentanil for maintenance of anesthesia. Patient-controlled analgesia programmed to deliver morphine, 1 mg. every 10 minutes, was used for pain management postoperatively. Hypoxemic episodes were scored as Spo(2) >4% below the polysomnography study baseline and lasting for more than 10 s. RESULTS: Eight men and 32 women were enrolled and 1 subject had incomplete data. Thirty-one of the 40 subjects had polysomnography-confirmed OSA. Eight subjects used home continuous positive airway pressure devices nightly, and six of these used their device postoperatively. Preoperatively, subjects with OSA had lower nadir Spo(2) during the polysomnography study and a larger number had an apnea/hypopnea index >10 episodes per hour compared with the non-OSA group. In the first 24 h postoperatively, there was no difference in the median Spo(2) with and without oxygen therapy, between OSA and non-OSA groups. The number of episodes of oxygen desaturation >4% below the polysomnography study baseline value and the mean number of desaturation episodes per hour did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In morbidly obese subjects, in the first 24 h after laparoscopic bariatric surgery, OSA does not seem to increase the risk of postoperative hypoxemia. Our data confirm that morbidly obese subjects, with or without OSA, experience frequent oxygen desaturation episodes postoperatively, despite supplemental oxygen therapy suggesting that perioperative management strategies in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery should include measures to prevent postoperative hypoxemia.","2008","Anesthesia and analgesia"," In this study , we sought to determine whether obese patients with polysomnography-confirmed diagnosis of OSA were at significantly greater risk for postoperative hypoxemic episodes in the first 24 h after laparoscopic bariatric surgery than morbidly obese patients without a diagnosis of OSA ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","McArdle N. et al.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The evidence that obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (OSAH) is a risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular disease is inconclusive. We explored this relationship in transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients because they are less likely than stroke patients to have OSAH as a consequence of cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: We performed a case-control study among 86 patients with TIA from a hospital neurovascular clinic, matched for age (+/-5 years) and sex with controls from the referring local family practice registers. RESULTS: Forty-nine of the 86 matched pairs were male and the body mass index was similar among cases and controls. The primary outcome measure, the apnea/hypopnea index [AHI=number of (apneas+hypopneas)/h slept, measured during overnight polysomnography and scored blind to case-control status], was the same for cases and controls (21/hour). However, the median number of 4% desaturations during sleep was slightly greater in the cases (12/hour) than controls (6/hour, P=0.04). There were the expected associations between TIA and higher fibrinogen levels (TIA 3.3, control 3.0 g/L, P=0.01), previous myocardial infarction (TIA 22, control 6%, P=0.007), a history of ever smoking (TIA 71, control 54%, P=0.01), hypertension (TIA 51, control 21%, P=0.001), and raised cholesterol (TIA 27, control 10%, P=0.01), with a weak trend for diabetes mellitus (TIA 10, control 6%, P=0.4).

","Tanriverdi H. et al.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has a critical association with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and aortic stiffness are early signs of atherosclerosis. The presence of subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed in OSA patients using these parameters. METHODS: 40 patients with OSA showing an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > or =5 (mean age 51.3 +/- 9 years, 32 males) and 24 controls (AHI < 5, mean age 51.9 +/- 5.2 years, 19 males) were enrolled in the study. In all subjects, polysomnographic examination and recordings were performed during sleep. IMT of the carotid artery, endothelium-dependent/-independent vasodilation of the brachial artery and aortic elastic parameters were investigated using high-resolution Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: The demographic data of the patients with OSA and controls were not significantly different. Subjects with OSA demonstrated higher values of aortic stiffness (7.1 +/- 1.88 vs. 6.42 +/- 1.56, respectively) and IMT (0.85 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.11 mm, p = 0.0001, respectively) but lower distensibility (9.47 +/- 1.33 vs. 11.8 +/- 3.36 cm(2)/dyn/10(6)) and FMD (4.57 +/- 1.3 vs. 6.34 +/- 0.83%, p = 0.0001, respectively) than the controls. The respiratory disturbance index correlated positively with aortic stiffness and IMT and negatively with distensibility and FMD. CONCLUSION: We observed blunted endothelium-dependent dilatation, increased carotid IMT and aortic stiffness in patients with OSA compared with matched control subjects. This is evident in the absence of other diseases, suggesting that OSA is an independent cause of atherosclerosis. These simple and non-invasive methods help to detect subclinical atherosclerosis in OSA.","2006","Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) has a critical association with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Twenty-seven patients (53%) and 9 patients (17.6%), respectively, reported a history of snoring and severe daytime sleepiness prior to experiencing a stroke, while the mean Epworth sleepiness scale score was 6.8 +/- 3.6. Polysomnography revealed 34 patients (67%) with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > or = 10 events per hour, 31 patients (61%) with an AHI of > or = 15 events per hour, and 25 patients (49%) with an AHI of > or = 20 events per hour. Significant obstructive SDB, defined as an AHI of > or = 20/h, was more prevalent in ischemic stroke patients than in control subjects (49% vs 24%, respectively; p = 0.04) and was associated with a higher BMI (p = 0.046). Among the 34 patients with an AHI of > or = 10/h, CPAP titration was tolerated by 16 patients, but only 4 patients who had typical sleep apnea features proceeded to home CPAP treatment with objective compliance over a period of 3 months of 2.5 +/- 0.6 h per night.

","Koehnlein T. et al.","BACKGROUND: Increased cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels predict mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance hemodialysis. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with severe cardiac stress and systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that in patients with ESRD elevated levels of cTnT and CRP are consequences of unrecognized OSA. METHODS: After diagnostic polysomnography, serum levels of cTnT and CRP were assessed in two groups of patients. The first group with normal renal function which served as a control group, was recruited from routine patient referrals to the sleep laboratory at the University Hospital Magdeburg. The second group consisted of patients with ESRD on thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis treatment (hemodialysis group). RESULTS: After screening, 15 patients in each group were eligible for inclusion. OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) > or = 10) was associated with significantly elevated serum CRP levels of 5.1 +/- 4.9 mg/l in the control group and 11.6 +/- 10.2 mg/l in the hemodialysis group, compared with patients in the respective groups without OSA. In the control group, cTnT levels were below the lower detection limit, independent of OSA severity. Patients with ESRD but without OSA had low cTnT levels, similar to those of patients in the control group (0.014 +/- 0.01 ìg/l), whereas patients with ESRD and OSA had significantly elevated serum cTnT levels (0.38 +/- 0.3 microg/l, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: OSA is associated with higher CRP levels in patients with normal or impaired renal function, but cTnT is elevated in OSA patients with impaired renal function only. In this pilot study, both parameters suggest an important role of sleep related breathing disorders on cardiac stress and chronic inflammation.","2009","Clinical nephrology",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Records of 72 patients under 14 years (mean age 21 months) with heart diseases, corresponding to 104 FB performed between January 1993 and October 2004 were reviewed. The principal cardiac diseases were left-to-right shunt (51.9%), followed by right-to-left shunt (17.3%) and miscellaneous cardiopathies (8.7%). The main indications for FB assessment were study of atelectasis (35%), stridor (14%), and pneumonia (14%). Airway malacias, as a group, were the commonest finding, represented mainly by left main bronchus malacia (24%). The second most common finding was stenosis by extrinsic compression, and among these, 75% corresponded to left main bronchus compression. Sixteen different types of clinically meaningful utilities were obtained. No mortality was reported and in only one procedure was there a major complication, which was easily managed.

","Friedlander A. et al.","PURPOSE: Persons with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) suffer inordinately high rates of stroke, but the cause remains in doubt. Atherosclerosis (atheroma formation) of the extracranial carotid artery has been suggested as a possible cause. Because atheromas can be recognized on panoramic radiographs, this study compared their prevalence in subjects with OSAS and normal controls and analyzed their relation to atherogenic risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Panoramic radiographs and medical records of 54 male subjects (mean age, 60.4 years) with OSAS (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] of 15 or greater and a history of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness) were assessed for atheromas and risk factors. Age-matched controls were likewise assessed. RESULTS: Twelve individuals (22%) with OSAS showed atheromas on their radiographs. The radiographs of the controls showed that 3.7% had atheromas. This finding was statistically significant (P = .0079). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among individuals with OSAS and atheroma formation (7 of 12 persons, 58%) was far greater than the prevalence of diabetes (10 of 42 persons, 24%) experienced by individuals with OSAS but free of atheroma formation. This finding was also statistically significant (P = .035). The lesions seen in both the subject and control populations were similar and were located in the neck, 1.5 to 2.5 cm inferior-posterior to the angle of the mandible. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with OSAS are more likely to manifest calcified atheromas on their panoramic radiographs than age-matched controls.

Criteria have been established for the evaluation of patients suitable for ACS and adherence to these guidelines has increased the extubation rate and reduced mortality. The objective of the study was to assess the use of the procedure at our tertiary referral centre. METHOD: In this retrospective clinical study, 33 patients were identified over an 11-year period between 1993 and 2004 with subglottic narrowing at the level of the cricoid ring, and who subsequently underwent an ACS. Demographic data, duration of intubation, indication and number of reintubations, success rate and complications were noted. Patients included in the study were infants who repeatedly failed trials of extubation and those who presented with persistent stridor. RESULTS: Twenty-nine out of 33 (88%) children were successfully extubated as a result of the cricoid split procedure. Four children failed extubation after the cricoid split. Three required a tracheostomy and one child remained intubated for a prolonged period.

,"10845284"," Distraction osteogenesis for obstructive apneas in patients with congenital craniofacial malformations. ","Morovic C. and Monasterio L.","Infants with congenital craniofacial malformations often have associated severe mandibular hypoplasia causing obstruction of the hypopharynx by retroposition of the base of the tongue into the posterior pharyngeal airway. Management depends on the severity of the airway obstruction. Most cases can be managed by prone positioning until the infant outgrows the problem at 3 to 6 months of age. In more critical cases, monitoring of oxygen saturation, temporary placement of a nasopharyngeal tube, and placement of an endotracheal tube will be useful procedures. Tracheotomy is an effective method for more severe cases, but longstanding tracheotomies result in high morbidity and occasional mortality. Mandibular distraction was performed in seven patients, ranging in age from 1 to 18 months, with critical obstructive apnea secondary to mandibular hypoplasia characterized by an apnea/hypopnea index greater than 20 apneas per hour and oxygen saturation below 80 percent. Two patients were tracheotomized previously. Mandibular lengthening, from 16 to 25 mm on the left side and from 10 to 22 mm on the right, was achieved in 21 to 25 days. Improvement of airway obstruction parameters was measured on polysomnograms and lateral cephalograms. Mandibular lengthening by gradual distraction is a successful method for young patients with severe mandibular hypoplasia causing critical obstructive apneas. Avoidance of tracheotomy or early decannulation in previously tracheotomized patients is a great advantage for patients with congenital craniofacial malformation.","2000","Plastic and reconstructive surgery",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

GH treatment in PWS results in a remarkable growth response and an improvement of body composition and muscle strength. Data concerning effects on respiratory parameters, are however, limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate effects of GH on respiratory parameters in prepubertal PWS children. DESIGN: Polysomnography was performed before GH in 53 children and repeated after 6 months of GH treatment in 35 of them. PATIENTS: Fifty-three prepubertal PWS children (30 boys), with median (interquartile range) age of 5.4 (2.1-7.2) yr and body mass index of +1.0 sd score (-0.1-1.7). INTERVENTION: Intervention included treatment with GH 1 mg/m2.d. RESULTS: Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was 5.1 per hour (2.8-8.7) (normal 0-1 per hour). Of these, 2.8 per hour (1.5-5.4) were central apneas and the rest mainly hypopneas. Duration of apneas was 15.0 sec (13.0-28.0). AHI did not correlate with age and body mass index, but central apneas decreased with age (r = -0.34, P = 0.01). During 6 months of GH treatment, AHI did not significantly change from 4.8 (2.6-7.9) at baseline to 4.0 (2.7-6.2; P = 0.36). One patient died unexpectedly during a mild upper respiratory tract infection, although he had a nearly normal polysomnography. CONCLUSIONS: PWS children have a high AHI, mainly due to central apneas. Six months of GH treatment does not aggravate the sleep-related breathing disorders in young PWS children. Our study also shows that monitoring during upper respiratory tract infection in PWS children should be considered.","2006","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism"," OBJECTIVE : The objective of the study was to evaluate effects of GH on respiratory parameters in prepubertal PWS children ","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Yilmaz M. et al.","BACKGROUND: Vascular rings and other congenital aortic arch anomalies may be major causes of tracheoesophageal obstruction in children. In this report, our diagnostic approach, surgical treatment, and early and late results for 30 patients are reported. METHODS: During a 20-year period (1982-2002), 30 children underwent surgery for tracheoesophageal compression caused by aortic arch anomalies. The median age at operation was 8 months (range, 36 days to 94 months), and the median patient weight was 8 kg (range, 2.4-16 kg). At 53.3% of cases, double aortic arch was by far the most common encountered cause of compression. Patients were admitted with respiratory distress, stridor, apnea, dysphagia, or recurrent respiratory tract infections. Diagnosis was established by barium esophagogram, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. The operative approaches were through a left thoracotomy or a median sternotomy. RESULTS: Operative mortality rate was 3.3%. Follow-up data from 2 months to 10 years (mean follow-up, 34 weeks) were available for all 30 patients. Twenty-six patients (86.7%) were essentially free of symptoms, 3 patients (10%) had residual respiratory problems, and 1 patient (3.3 %) had a gastroesophageal reflux problem.

In 30 patients (25 male, 5 female; age 23 to 74 years; mean, 56 years) with very large fistulas and airway problems, we inserted an airway stent (Dynamic) (n = 12) or an esophageal tube combined with a Dynamic airway stent (n = 18) with the aim of sealing the fistula and restoring patency of the airway and GI passage. The tracheobronchial Dynamic stent was chosen because its slightly concave, flexible posterior silicone membrane adapts ideally to the convex esophageal tube. The stents were well tolerated and significantly improved the quality of life. Of 30 patients, 16 could breathe and swallow unimpaired until shortly before their death. Moderate complaints persisted in five patients, dysphagia in eight patients, and dyspnea in one patient.

The diagnosis of OSAS was made when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of more than 15 events per hour of sleep; the patients with an AHI of less than 15 formed a control group.

","Fornas C. et al.","Sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is an entity that occurs frequently in the population and produces an elevated morbidity and mortality, especially at an apnea index greater than 20 events per hour. To our knowledge there are only a few studies available addressing the general health status of sleep apnea hypopnea patients. Such information may be useful for both clinical management and better understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms of the disease, particularly with the consideration that not infrequently the physiological disturbances found in such patients do not always agree with their own health perception. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the general health status and the degree of daytime somnolence, as a major symptom in SAHS patients, and relate them to the number of respiratory events per hour. Measurements of general health status and the degree of daytime somnolence were assessed in 103 consecutive patients 50.4 +/- 12 years old [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] with an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 38 +/- 27 events per hour. Forty nonsnoring healthy subjects were used as the control group. During the afternoon preceding the full polysomnography, a medical history was taken; basic anthropometric data and the presence of other diseases were recorded. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire and a questionnaire assessing the degree of daytime somnolence were administered to the patients. No significant differences were found in the general health status and the degree of daytime hypersomnolence when patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of the respiratory events during the night, but there were significant differences between SAHS patients and control subjects. It was concluded that in spite of the fact that SAHS patients showed a deterioration of general health status parameters in comparison with healthy subjects, these parameters do not correlate with the physiological disturbances of SAHS, expressed as the number of respiratory events per hour.","1995","Sleep"," Therefore , the aim of the present study was to assess the general health status and the degree of daytime somnolence , as a major symptom in SAHS patients , and relate them to the number of respiratory events per hour ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Aortic elastic parameters are important markers for left ventricular (LV) function and are deteriorated in cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aortic elastic parameters and LV functions and mass were investigated in 40 patients with OSA (apnea - hypopnea index (AHI) >or=5) (mean age 51.3 +/-9 years, 32 males) and 24 controls (AHI <5) (mean age 51.9+/-5.2 years, 19 males). All subjects underwent polysomnographic examination and recordings were obtained during sleep. They also underwent a complete echocardiographic examination and systolic and diastolic aortic measurements were noted from M-mode traces of the aortic root. There were no significant differences in the demographic data of the patients with OSA and the controls. Subjects with OSA demonstrated higher values of aortic stiffness (7.1+/-1.88 vs 6.42+/-1.56, p=0.0001), but lower distensibility (9.47+/-1.33 vs 11.8+/-3.36, p=0.0001) than the controls. LV ejection fraction was significantly lower in patients with OSA when compared with the control group (61.3+/-5.2% vs 65.9+/-8.4%, p=0.0001).

SETTING: Research sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Ten CHF patients with SDB, predominantly obstructive sleep apnea. INTERVENTIONS: The HCVR was measured from the change in middle cerebral artery velocity, using pulsed Doppler ultrasound. HCVR was determined during the evening (before) and morning (after) 1 night of sleep on ASV and 1 night of spontaneous sleep (control). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Compared with the control situation, ASV decreased the apnea-hypopnea index (group mean +/- SEM, control: 48 +/- 12, ASV: 4 +/- 1 events per hour).

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of Surgisis, a commercially available, biocompatible, acellular matrix, in the repair of a critical-size tracheal defect. METHODS: A full-thickness defect (2 mm x 6 mm) was created in tracheal rings 4 through 6 in adult rats. A piece of 8-ply Surgisis (Cook; Bloomington, IN) was sutured to the edges of the defect with interrupted 8-0 polypropylene sutures. In control animals, the defect was closed primarily. The trachea was harvested at 4 weeks and prepared for histologic evaluation using conventional techniques. Cross-sectional area and perimeters were calculated using imaging software. RESULTS: Tracheal defects without patch repair (n = 3) resulted in tracheal stenosis and immediate death. Animals that underwent Surgisis patch repair of tracheal defects (n = 10) tolerated the procedure well and had no audible stridor or evidence of respiratory distress. Eight of ten animals survived 4 weeks. The tracheal lumen was patent with no evidence of contracture or degradation of the Surgisis. Histologically, neovascularization of the Surgisis was noted with moderate inflammation. The surface of the Surgisis patch was covered ith a lining of ciliated epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: In the rodent model, Surgisis appears to be an efficacious method for the patch repair of partial circumferential tracheal defects. Surgisis appears to be a safe and promising means of facilitating neovascularization and tissue regeneration.

Because there are no controlled studies showing a substantial effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy on hypertension in OSA, the impact of treatment on cardiovascular sequelae has been questioned altogether. Therefore, we studied the effect of nCPAP on arterial hypertension in patients with OSA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty consecutive patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomly assigned to either effective or subtherapeutic nCPAP for 9 weeks on average. Nocturnal polysomnography and continuous noninvasive blood pressure recording for 19 hours was performed before and with treatment. Thirty two patients, 16 in each group, completed the study. Apneas and hypopneas were reduced by approximately 95% and 50% in the therapeutic and subtherapeutic groups, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 9.9+/-11.4 mm Hg with effective nCPAP treatment, whereas no relevant change occurred with subtherapeutic nCPAP (P=0.01). Mean, diastolic, and systolic blood pressures all decreased significantly by approximately 10 mm Hg, both at night and during the day. CONCLUSIONS: Effective nCPAP treatment in patients with moderate to severe OSA leads to a substantial reduction in both day and night arterial blood pressure. The fact that a 50% reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index did not result in a decrease in blood pressure emphasizes the importance of highly effective treatment.

","Mozes Y. et al.","Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is well known in human history as a major cause of disease in domestic and wild animals and as a rare condition in humans. For the last seventy years, anthrax was developed and occasionally stored as an agent of biological weapon arsenal in numerous countries. The incubation period in humans is 1-6 days and the disease may be present as three distinct clinical syndromes: cutaneous, inhalational, and gastrointestinal disease. The major concern in regard of biological warfare is the inhalational form of anthrax, which starts as a febrile flu-like disease. The development of malaise, fatigue, cough and mild chest discomfort is followed by severe respiratory distress with dyspnea, diaphoresis, stridor, and cyanosis. Shock and death occur within 24-36 hours after onset of severe symptoms. Physical findings are non-specific, but a widened mediastinum is usually seen on chest x-ray. A positive blood culture, immunohistochemical methods and the use of the polymerase chain reaction method confirm the diagnosis. Although effectiveness may be limited after severe symptoms are present, a high dose of antibiotic treatment should be administered and aggressive supportive therapy may be necessary. In the situation of an anthrax attack, as was recently seen in the United States, penicillin is no longer recommended as an acceptable first line therapy. In this case, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is the recommended drug of choice since penicillin-resistant strains may be used, as well as the possibility of the emergence of an inducible beta-lactamase positive bacterium. Since a high infecting dose may exacerbate the clinical course of the disease, a combination antibiotic regimen should be considered. The disease is not contagious and standard precautions are sufficient. Pre-exposure prophylaxis is based on a vaccine administration, while post-exposure prophylaxis is feasible by the initial use of oral ciprofloxacin or doxycycline. In this article we reviewed the literature with emphasis on the recent medical reports from the United States analyzing the eleven cases of inhalational anthrax as well as the new guidelines for diagnosis and treatment that resulted from the bioterrorism attack in October 2001. Although physical findings were non-specific, abnormal findings on chest x-rays were present in all the eleven cases. A positive blood culture, immunohistochemical methods and the use of the polymerase chain reaction method were highly valuable in revealing and confirming the diagnosis of anthrax. In the case of an attack with anthrax spores, the likelihood of exposure to a large infective dose of high quality spores, may require a prolonged period of treatment as well as prolonged post-exposure therapy.","2002","Harefuah",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 268 patients were referred for suspected laryngotracheal obstruction during the 30 months between September 1, 1995 and March 1, 1998: 173 had 206 flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopies, and 160 had 273 direct laryngoscopies. One hundred and forty-one children were identified with laryngotracheal obstruction, yielding 40 different diagnoses that could be classified into 9 major categories. Thirty-six children (25.5%) had multiple sites of upper airway obstruction. RESULTS: 138 children had follow-up >1 month. Twelve children died (8.7%), leaving 126 survivors (mean follow-up=21.1 months). Outcomes were classified as resolved (44.2%), improved (37.0%), stable (9.4%), failed (0.7%), or death (8.7%). Better outcomes were seen in more readily treated diagnostic categories, such as tracheobronchial foreign body, chronic laryngitis, and suprastomal granulation tissue; laryngeal stenosis, tracheomalacia, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, had less favorable outcomes (P<.001). The former group also showed superior outcome compared to laryngomalacia (P<.001) and vocal cord mobility disorders (P=.004). Ninety-four patients (68.1%) had comorbidities complicating their management.

,"10944939"," [Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) and ischemic heart disease (IHD)]. ","Maekawa M. and Shiomi T.","Several epidemiological studies have suggested that sleep-disordered breathing is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, particularly hypertension, stroke and IHD. The relative risk for IHD among obstructive SAS(OSAS) patients is 1.2 to 6.9 higher compared with the general population. The prevalence of SAS with an apnea-hypopnea index(AHI) of 10 and over was 35 to 40% in IHD, while 23.8% of SAS patients had IHD. These evidence suggests that IHD is an important prognostic factor in SAS patients. Characteristic pathophysiological conditions such as sleep apnea-induced hypoxemia and sympathetic activation may play an important role in the genesis of nocturnal angina pectoris. Most patients with OSAS are obese, and the complication of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is quite a few. Insulin resistance is also attracting great attention as a cause of the cardiovascular complication of SAS.","2000","Nihon rinsho.

,"14577067"," Patterns of management of congenital tracheal stenosis. ","Antón-Pacheco J. et al.","BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Stenosing airway disease, including congenital and acquired lesions, is rare in the pediatric age group. Until recently, the outlook for patients with congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) was dismal because medical management was the only way of treatment. Surgical and endoscopical techniques developed in the last years have improved the prognosis. This report reviews the short and long-term outcomes of a single-institution experience in the management of CTS in children, comparing different treatment modalities. METHODS: From 1991 to 2002, 13 cases of CTS have been managed in the authors unit. Respiratory symptoms varied from mild stridor on exertion to severe distress. Bronchoscopy established the diagnosis in all cases. According to clinical and endoscopical features, patients have been classified into 3 groups. The following data have been studied in each case: sex, age at diagnosis and treatment, anatomic type, associated anomalies, treatment modality, complications, outcome, and time of follow-up. RESULTS: Seven girls and 6 boys have been included in this study. Age at diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 7 years (median, 8 months), and 77% showed associated anomalies. Four patients presented mild or no symptoms and have been treated expectantly. The other 9 patients have been operated on because of persistent or severe symptomatology. The following procedures have been performed: costal cartilage tracheoplasty (n = 5), tracheal resection (n = 3), slide tracheoplasty (n = 2), endoscopical dilatation (n = 3), and laser resection (n = 1). Three patients required 2 or more procedures, and there were 3 early deaths, all after costal cartilage tracheoplasty. Overall mortality rate in the series is 23%. Follow-up is complete in all survivors (n = 10) ranging from 6 months to 10 years (mean, 4.7 years). CONCLUSIONS: Selection of the type of treatment depends on the patient's clinical status and the anatomic pattern of the stenosis. In symptomatic cases of short-segment stenoses the authors prefer tracheal resection with end-to-end anastomosis; for long-segment stenoses, slide tracheoplasty is the procedure of choice.","2003","Journal of pediatric surgery","BACKGROUND / PURPOSE : Stenosing airway disease , including congenital and acquired lesions , is rare in the pediatric age group ","Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Javaheri S. et al.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and effect of sleep-disordered breathing in ambulatory patients with stable, optimally treated congestive heart failure. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal study. SETTING: Referral sleep laboratory of a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. PATIENTS: 42 of the 48 eligible patients with stable congestive heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 45%). MEASUREMENTS: After an adaptation night, polysomnography and Holter monitoring were done in the sleep laboratory. Arterial blood gases and pH were measured, and cardiac radionuclide ventriculography and pulmonary, renal, and thyroid function tests were done. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups. Group I (n = 23) had an hourly rate of apnea and hypopnea (apnea-hypopnea index) of 20 episodes per hour or less; group II (n = 19 [45%; CI, 30% to 60%]) had an index of more than 20 episodes per hour. In group II, the index varied from 26.5 to 82.2 episodes per hour (mean +/- SD, 44 +/- 13 episodes per hour; CI, 38 to 51 episodes per hour). Group II had significantly more arousals (24 +/- 12 compared with 3 +/- 3 in group I) that were directly attributable to episodes of apnea and hypopnea, longer periods of time with an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 90% (23% +/- 24% of total sleep time compared with 2% +/- 4%), lower arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep (74% +/- 13% compared with 87% +/- 4%), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (22% +/- 9% compared with 30% +/- 10%), and a significantly increased number of episodes of nocturnal ventricular arrhythmias. Multiple regression analyses showed that left ventricular systolic dysfunction was an independent risk factor for sleep apnea in patients with congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of severe occult sleep-disordered breathing is high in ambulatory patients with stable, optimally treated chronic congestive heart failure. The breathing episodes are associated with severe nocturnal arterial blood oxyhemoglobin desaturation and excessive arousals. Severe untreated sleep-disordered breathing may adversely affect left ventricular function, resulting in a vicious cycle that could contribute to death in patients with congestive heart failure.

","Doherty L. et al.","BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from cardiovascular disease, but the impact of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is unclear. METHODS: We performed a long-term follow-up study of 168 patients with OSAS who had begun receiving CPAP therapy at least 5 years previously, most of whom had been prospectively followed up, having been the subject of an earlier report on cardiovascular risk factors in OSAS patients. The average follow-up period was 7.5 years. We compared the cardiovascular outcomes of those patients who were intolerant of CPAP (untreated group, 61 patients) with those continuing CPAP therapy (107 patients). RESULTS: CPAP-treated patients had a higher median apnea-hypopnea index score than the untreated group (48.3 [interquartile range (IQR), 33.6 to 66.4] vs 36.7 [IQR, 27.4 to 55], respectively; p = 0.02), but age, body mass index, and time since diagnosis were similar. Deaths from cardiovascular disease were more common in the untreated group than in the CPAP-treated group during follow-up (14.8% vs 1.9%, respectively; p = 0.009 [log rank test]), but no significant differences were found in the development of new cases of hypertension, cardiac disorder, or stroke. Total cardiovascular events (ie, death and new cardiovascular disease combined) were more common in the untreated group than in the CPAP-treated group (31% vs 18%, respectively; p < 0.05).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all Olmsted County residents with the diagnosis of epiglottitis during the 15-year period from Jan. 1, 1976, through Dec. 31, 1990. RESULTS: From 1976 through 1990, 41 residents (20 children and 21 adults) of Olmsted County were diagnosed with epiglottitis. (One case in an adult was first diagnosed at autopsy and was included only in the incidence rates and analysis of seasonal and secular trends.) Children had a mean annual incidence rate of 4.25 per 100,000, whereas the rate in adults was 2.18 per 100,000. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of epiglottitis decreased during the study period from 4.94 per 100,000 during 1976 through 1980 to 2.08 per 100,000 during 1986 through 1990. No seasonal effect was detected in adults or children. At initial assessment, adults tended to have pharyngeal symptoms (sore throat and odynophagia), cervical adenopathy, and ear pain, whereas children most often had respiratory (stridor, dyspnea, and retractions) and laryngeal symptoms. Proportionately, more children than adults received artificial airway support and had associated pneumonia. One death occurred in an adult, in whom the diagnosis was made at autopsy.

This study reports our experiences in managing adult patients with acute epiglottitis in a Taiwanese setting. STUDY DESIGN: Admission medical records from 46 adult patients with acute epiglottitis over a period of 8 years in a tertiary referral otolaryngology service were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: No mortality was reported; 4 (8.7%) patients were supported by artificial airway. A total of 16 (34.8%) patients had comorbid conditions; hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common systemic diseases. Patients who needed artificial airway support tended to have more systemic comorbidities ( P = 0.001) and a higher level of hyperglycemia ( P = 0.004) than those who did not need airway support. The incidences of drooling, stridor/dyspnea, and muffled voice were significantly higher in the airway-supported group ( P < 0.05). Stridor/dyspnea is a reliable clinical predictor of airway compromise (odds ratio 2.94; P = 0.0277). CONCLUSION: Dyspnea is a warning sign of impending airway collapse during an episode of acute epiglottitis.

","Skobel E. et al.","BACKGROUND: Quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) is often severely compromised. Sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) like Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS) are often observed in patients with severe HF resulting in fragmentation of sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased mortality. While an apnea/hypopnea-index (AHI) >30/h represents an independent predictor of poor prognosis, clinical relevance of even minor SRBD with an AHI <30/h remains unclear with respect to quality of life, exercise capacity or depression rate. METHODS: Sixty-nine consecutive ambulatory patients with stable HF (NYHA II-III, EF 25%) underwent two night polygraphies with a six-channel ambulatory recording. Spiroergometry was performed, and patients were examined for sleep quality (PSQI), depressed mood (BDI) and health-related quality of life (SF-36). The data were compared to 10 age-matched healthy controls and 11 patients with OSAS (AHI 14-29/h) not suffering from HF. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients completed follow up. 52% were positively diagnosed for SRBD (AHI 16-30/h: 12 patients CSR, 5 patients OSAS, 9 patients mixed); 25 patients (48%) showed no relevant SRBD. Patients with HF and SRBD had lower quality of life than patients without SRBD and HF. The severity of SRBD as indicated by the AHI significantly correlated with quality of life measures: Bodily pain, physical functioning and social functioning showed largest impairment in patients with HF and SRBD. Furthermore, elevated depression rates in correlation to the AHI were only observed in patients with SRBD similar to patients with OSAS without HF. CONCLUSION: Even minor SRBD in patients with HF independently influence quality of life and correlate with estimation of depression and sleep disturbances.","2005","European journal of heart failure",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

With the advent of high-resolution 2-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography, the detection rate of clinically silent CAF has increased, but their clinical significance and outcome have not been defined. The clinical, echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and angiographic findings and documented follow-up of 31 patients with an echocardiographic finding of a clinically silent coronary artery fistula from 1986 to 1997 were analyzed. Mean age at diagnosis was 7.2+/-8.4 years. Indications for echocardiography were murmur (n = 23), congenital heart disease (n = 2), cardiomegaly (n = 2), chest pain (n = 1), stridor (n = 1), syncope (n = 1), and chest trauma (n = 1). CAF were detected with color Doppler flow mapping in all patients. The origin of the fistula was from the left coronary artery system (n = 27), right coronary artery system (n = 3), and bilateral (n = 1). The exit sites were the pulmonary artery (n = 18), right ventricle (n = 8), right atrium (n = 2), and left ventricle (n = 3). Global and regional left ventricular function were normal in all patients at presentation and follow-up. Spontaneous closure of the fistula was documented in 7 patients (23%) at mean follow-up of 2.6+/-2.0 years. In 23 patients the fistula persisted without intervention. All patients remained asymptomatic, without adverse clinical events or evidence of ischemia at a mean age at follow-up of 9.3+/-9.1 years (range 4 months to 42.0). Based on this experience, there is no evidence that clinically silent CAF diagnosed incidentally by color Doppler echocardiography are associated with adverse clinical outcome in childhood and adolescence.

We report a single centre experience in managing this difficult problem. METHODS: Twenty-four infants and children with TBO referred to our unit over a 12-year period are reviewed. Aetiology of TBO included vascular rings (n = 9), anomalous innominate artery (n = 6), congenital tracheal stenosis (n = 5), segmental bronchial stenosis (n = 2) and pulmonary artery compression of the main bronchi (n = 2). Seven patients had concurrent cardiac anomalies. Stridor was the commonest presenting symptom (67%). Mean delay from onset of symptoms to referral was 19 months. One patient died preoperatively due to acute airway obstruction. Mean age at operation was 33.1 +/- 42 months (range 4 days-156 months) and 11 children were under 1 year at the time of surgery. In cases of TBO secondary to vascular rings, division of the ring resulted in relief of symptoms in seven cases, with two requiring further surgery for resultant tracheomalacia. Four of the five patients having tracheal resection were operated on with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass; three of these patients had concurrent correction of cardiac lesions, with two survivors. Tracheobronchial anastomoses were carried out using continuous polydioxanone (PDS). Patients with anomalous innominate arteries required aortopexy in five and innominate artery suspension in one, while those with pulmonary artery compression of the main bronchi had correction of their intracardiac defects (n = 2). RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 8.7% and there has been one late death due to Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to pulmonary regurgitation, atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). On follow-up (mean 40 +/- 31 months), 19 patients are alive and symptom free. There have been no anastomotic strictures following tracheobronchial resection. The single most important predictor of mortality was the presence of associated cardiac anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: TBO can be managed effectively by a single operation in both infants and children without a detrimental effect on tracheal growth. We advocate consideration of concurrent repair of the tracheal and cardiac lesions. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) allows this concurrent correction of cardiac lesions and also facilitates tracheal resection.","1997","European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery"," OBJECTIVE : Congenital tracheobronchial obstruction ( TBO ) presents a complex problem both in terms of diverse aetiology , presence of associated anomalies and the operative strategy to be adopted ","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Polysomnography was performed with an Autoset Portable Plus II in 139 patients within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. Standard polysomnographic data, signs and symptoms related with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) prior to ischemic stroke, vascular risk factors, and characteristics and onset time (day/night) of ischemic stroke were recorded. The polysomnographic data were compared with results published for subjects of a similar age in the general population. RESULTS: The mean age was 73.6 (SD 11.1) years (59% of the patients were men). Prior to the stroke, 64.7% of the patients snored, 21.6% presented repetitive sleep apneas, and 35.6% had daytime sleepiness. The mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 29.1 (17.9) episodes/hour, the obstructive component of which was 20.1 (15.7) episodes/hour. Five patients presented Cheyne-Stokes breathing. The AHI (for all cut-points from 5 to 50), chronic snoring, and daytime sleepiness were significantly greater than those published for the general population. The stroke characteristics showed no significant differences between daytime and nighttime onset. Nighttime stroke (60.4%) was associated with a significantly higher AHI (33.3 compared to 24.7 episodes/ hour) mainly because of obstructive apneas. Nighttime stroke was also associated with a greater nighttime desaturation and a greater probability of SAHS symptoms prior to stroke (odds ratio, 2.62). In contrast, there were no differences in vascular risk factors between daytime and nighttime stroke onset. CONCLUSION: The prevalences of sleep-disordered breath- ing with clinical signs and symptoms of SAHS were high in this population of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients with nighttime stroke had more obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and a higher clinical probability of obstructive SAHS before stroke. These findings support the hypothesis that obstructive SAHS is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, particularly for strokes presenting at night.","2004","Archivos de bronconeumologia"," OBJECTIVE : To analyze the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with acute ischemic stroke and the influence of the characteristics of the stroke and time of onset ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

All animals except three developed, as single primitive pathology, a dramatic enlargement of the thyroid gland. Compression of trachea and esophagus, accompanied by dyspnea, inspiratory stridor, and dysphagia, led to a progressive cachexia and premature death attributed to respiratory failure. Despite the large thyroid volume, T4 levels were abnormally low, and the progression of the syndrome could be delayed by a substitutive treatment with thyroid hormones. The rapid evolution of the disease, leading to the death of most founder transgenic animals before the breeding age, prevented transmission of the transgene to their offspring. Only two transgenic lines are presently surviving. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissues revealed a specific expression of the simian virus-40 antigens in the thyroid cells. Hyperplasia was already obvious at birth. Older animals displayed moderately to poorly differentiated thyroid adenocarcinomas. Electron microscopy revealed, however, the persistence of cell polarity and the presence of microfollicles between the densely packed cells. Cell lines derived from these large T-expressing thyroids were shown to have lost expression of both thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase, while expressing low levels of TSH receptors. These transgenic mice could constitute an interesting model of aggressive adenocarcinoma, sharing phenotypical similarities with the anaplastic type of human thyroid tumors.","1991","Endocrinology",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

METHODS: From 1992 to 2007, we reimplanted the left pulmonary artery in 13 children with a pulmonary arterial sling. Their median age was 8 months, with a range from 1 to 72 months. We also performed tracheal resection with end-to-end anastomosis, or complex tracheal reconstructions. In 5 patients, the reoperation was indicated because of persistent tracheal stenosis not treated initially at first correction of the arterial sling. All patients presented with stridor and respiratory distress. Cardiac catheterization, bronchoscopy and multidetecting computer tomography angiography were performed in all cases prior to the operation. All operations were performed under cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS: There was no operative or late mortality. The patients were extubated under bronchoscopic control. The mean period of intubation was 18 plus or minus 8 days, and the average follow-up was 8 plus or minus 4 years. The patients showed no signs of tracheal re-stenosis clinically or on bronchoscopy. The group of the patients under reoperations, however, required longer periods of intubation and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our experience demonstrates that, in patients with a pulmonary arterial sling, any associated tracheal stenosis should be explored at the initial operation, since decompression of the trachea by reimplanting the anomalously located pulmonary artery fails to provide relief. The funnel trachea, if present, undergoes progressive stenosis, and will require surgical repair. The use of cardiopulmonary bypass permitted extensive mobilization of the tracheobronchial tree, and allowed us to perform a tension-free anastomotic reconstruction of the trachea.","2009","Cardiology in the young",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

RESULTS: Ninety patients underwent awake tracheotomy, and seven were converted from cricothyrostomy to tracheostomy. Indications for awake tracheotomy included impending airway obstruction from malignancy of the aerodigestive tract or that causing extrinsic compression of the airway in 72 (80%) patients, neck abscess in 4 (4.4%), subglottic stenosis in 3 (3.3%), and a variety of other etiologies in 11 (12.2%).

","Noda A. et al.","Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vascular changes in individuals with OSAS have not been fully elucidated, however. The possible impact of OSAS on the extent of aortic pressure augmentation (AG), an indicator of cardiovascular risk, was investigated. Forty-five consecutive male patients aged 35 to 78 years (56.0+/-9.6 years) who were referred to the sleep clinic of Nagoya University Hospital for screening and treatment of OSAS and 71 age-matched healthy men were enrolled in the study. AG was derived from the pressure waveform measured at the radial artery by applanation tonometry. The number of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) was determined by standard polysomnography. AG was significantly greater in OSAS patients than in controls (9.0+/-4.1 vs. 6.4+/-3.4 mmHg, p<0.001), and it was significantly reduced in 19 OSAS patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure. AG was also significantly correlated with the AHI (r=0.562, p<0.001) and age (r=0.356, p=0.016) but not with the serum concentrations of low and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglyceride, or glycosylated hemoglobin. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the AHI was the most significant contributing factor to the increased AG in OSAS patients (beta=0.109, r=0.530, p<0.001). OSAS may thus have an adverse effect on vascular function that can be ameliorated by appropriate treatment.","2008","Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Forty consecutive recipients of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) with cardiac disease and a documented history of spontaneous, life-threatening, ventricular tachyarrhythmias underwent full night polysomnography. SRBDs were diagnosed if the apnea/hypopnea index was > 10. SRBD were diagnosed in 16 of 40 patients (40%): central sleep apnea (CSA) was present in 9 of these 16 patients (56%), 8 of whom had associated Cheyne-Stoke respiration. Seven of the 16 patients with SRBD (44%) had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients with and without SRBDs were comparable with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA classification, underlying heart disease, ICD indications, and concomitant antiarrhythmic drug and beta-blocker therapy. Patients were followed prospectively for 2 years. ICD-treated ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 10 of 24 patients (42%) without SRBD, in 4 of 9 patients (44%) with CSA, and in 3 of 7 patients (44%) with OSA (NS).

DESIGN: In vitro mechanical and degradative properties of 80:20 poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) ""finger-like"" stents were determined. The stents were then tested in vivo in rabbits that underwent anterior patch tracheoplasties with fascia lata grafts. Comparisons were made between a control group and an internal stent group for stridor development, overall group mortality, reconstructed airway lumen size, and histological findings. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five New Zealand white rabbits. RESULTS: The average dry modulus for the internal stents was 6800 kPa. All of the internal stents cracked by 4 weeks in buffer solution. Significant mass loss was not noted in vitro until after 5 weeks in buffer solution. By 14 weeks, the stents were nearly 100% degraded. The attrition rate for the control group was 23% compared with 17% for the experimental group. The stridor rate for the control group was also higher at 38% compared with 17% for the stented group. The stented rabbits had a significantly smaller average stenosis (23%) across the entire reconstruction site than the control group (34%) (P<.05).

More recently, there has been a suggestion that corticosteroids may be a useful alternative therapy for hypotension in VLBW infants, but there have been no prospective reports of such use for a current cohort of VLBW infants. METHODS: The California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative (CPQCC) requested members to supplement their routine Vermont Oxford Network data collection with additional information on any VLBW infant treated during their hospital course with PNS, for any indication. The indication, actual agent used, total initial daily dose, age at treatment, type of respiratory support, mean airway pressure, fraction of inspired oxygen, and duration of first dosing were recorded. RESULTS: From April 2002 to March 2003 in California, 22 of the 62 CPQCC hospitals reported supplemental data, if applicable, from a cohort of 1401 VLBW infants (expanded data group [EDG]), representing 33.2% of the VLBW infants registered with the CPQCC during the 12-month period. PNSs for CLD were administered to 8.2% of all VLBW infants in 2003, 8.6% of infants in the 42 hospitals that did not submit supplemental data (routine data-set group, compared with 7.6% in EDG hospitals). Of the 1401 VLBW infants in the EDG, 19.3% received PNSs; 3.6% received PNSs for only CLD, 11.8% for only non-CLD indications, and 4.0% for both indications. At all birth weight categories, non-CLD use was significantly greater than CLD use. The most common non-CLD indication was hypotension, followed by extubation stridor, for which 36 (16.3%) infants were treated. For hypotension, medications used were hydrocortisone followed by dexamethasone. Infants treated with PNSs exclusively for hypotension had a significantly higher incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and death when compared with infants treated only for CLD or those who did not receive PNSs. CONCLUSIONS: The common early use of hydrocortisone for hypotension and the high morbidity and mortality in children receiving such treatment has not been recognized previously and prospective trials evaluating the short- and long-term risk/benefit of such treatment are urgently required.","2006","Pediatrics"," OBJECTIVE : Postnatal steroids ( PNSs ) are used frequently to prevent or treat chronic lung disease ( CLD ) in the very low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant , and their use continues despite concerns regarding an increased incidence of longer-term neurodevelopmental abnormalities in such infants ","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Peled N. et al.","BACKGROUND: Although certain studies report high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), the effect of systemic hypoxia on circulating VEGF remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To study the association of serum VEGF and OSAS in a large group of patients. METHODS: One hundred patients with OSAS (mean age 58.1+/-12.4 years, mean body mass index 30.6+/-5.4 kg/m2) were tested for serum VEGF levels, and the findings were correlated with the severity of OSAS, as determined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) on the basis of polysomnography and background data. RESULTS: The mean AHI was 40.0+/-21.2 (range 10-106). Mean minimal oxygen saturation was 80.6+/-11.7% (range 43-98%) and mean time of oxygen saturation under 90% was 50.0+/-75.0 min (range 0-300 min). The mean VEGF level was 445.2+/-289.8 pg/ml in the study group (vs. 280 pg/ml reported in normal controls). The mean platelet count was 233.8+/-64.4 10(3)/ml and the mean VEGF/platelet ratio was 1.95+/-1.40 pg/10(6). There was no association of VEGF or VEGF/platelets with the severity of OSAS. However, both factors showed a significant correlation with patient age (r=0.224, p=0.01 and r=0.425, p=0.01, respectively). Age was the only parameter to significantly predict VEGF and VEGF/platelets on multivariate analysis (R2=0.713, p=0.001 and R2=0.844, p=0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The elevation of serum VEGF in OSAS is not associated with the severity of the disease, but it is associated with patient age. VEGF might be involved in the long-term adaptive mechanism in OSAS, and its age-dependent increase might partly explain the reduced mortality in elderly OSAS patients.","2007","Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases"," OBJECTIVES : To study the association of serum VEGF and OSAS in a large group of patients ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Friedlander A. et al.","PURPOSE: Persons with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) suffer cerebrovascular accidents at three to six times the rate of other Americans. Atherosclerosis of the cervical portion of the carotid artery has been suggested as a possible cause of these strokes. Lateral cephalometric radiographs used to determine the site of upper airway obstruction in sleep apnea patients can also image calcified cervical carotid artery atheromas. However, their prevalence in this group of patients has not been previously reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The radiographs of 47 male subjects (mean age 59.2 years, range 45 to 77 years) diagnosed as having OSAS (apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] of > or = 15 and a history of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness) were assessed for calcified carotid atheromas. Healthy, age-matched (+/-18 months) controls were likewise assessed. RESULTS: The radiographs of the subjects with OSAS showed that 21.3% had calcified atheromas. The radiographs of the controls showed that only 2.5% had calcified atheromas. This finding was statistically significant (P = < .000001). The lesions seen in both populations were similar, and located within the soft tissues of the neck at the level of C3 and C4. The lesions were superimposed over these tissues, the prevertebral fascia, and the pharyngeal airspace. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study seem to indicate that persons with OSAS have a greater prevalence of calcified carotid artery atheromas than healthy, age-matched persons. These lesions, a possible cause of future stroke, can be detected on lateral cephalometric radiographs.","1998","Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons"," PURPOSE : Persons with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) suffer cerebrovascular accidents at three to six times the rate of other Americans ","other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Surgical approaches proposed for this life-threatening lesion have included resection of localized stenoses; tracheoplasty involving interposition of cartilage, periosteum, or pericardium via an anterior tracheal split; or esophageal anastomosis to a posterior tracheal split. None of these techniques have provided uniformly satisfactory results, and all entail significant morbidity associated with the tracheal anastomosis. We have used endoscopic balloon dilatation in four children with critical airway obstruction from long-segment tracheal stenoses. In each of these patients, symptoms began early in life (from 2 weeks to 6 months of age) and consisted of respiratory distress from upper airway obstruction or recurrent episodes of stridor and chest retractions requiring hospitalization. The location of the tracheal stenoses varied, involving the upper third, middle third, middle half, and distal half of the trachea in the patients encountered. At bronchoscopy, the lumen was judged to be less than or equal to 1 mm in three of these patients. Dilatation was accomplished using Gruentzig balloon catheters in sizes ranging from 3 mm to (eventually) 8 mm, and produced a posterior split in the complete tracheal rings responsible for the stenosis in all patients, resulting in great increases in airway lumen. All children were improved following balloon dilatation, and three are currently doing well at 2.5, 3.0, and 3.0+ years postdilatation. One infant eventually died of airway obstruction incurred by severe bronchomalacia distal to the tip of an endotracheal tube that had been passed to the carina after sequential balloon dilatations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1991","Journal of pediatric surgery",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

In this study, we report a description of our approach and review of our 38-year experience in patients surgically treated for vascular rings. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients with/without symptomatic tracheoesophageal compression secondary to anomalies of the aortic arch and great vessels diagnosed from 1970 to 2008. A total of 183 patients underwent surgical repair. Median age at the time of the operation was 5 months (range, 3 days to 30 years). Patients were classified into 5 major subtypes based on their surgical anatomy as follows: right aortic arch-left ligamentum (n = 77), double aortic arch (n = 67), aberrant (retroesophageal) right subclavian artery (n = 30), pulmonary sling (n = 8), and innominate artery compression (n = 1). Six patients (3%) had an associated Kommerell diverticulum. In patients with a double aortic arch, 82% had a dominant right arch and 18% had a dominant left arch. Preoperatively, 80 patients (44%) had stridor, and 86 patients (47%) had recurrent upper respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: Associated cardiac diagnosis were present in 54 (30%) of 183 of all patients with vascular rings. Left thoracotomy was a common operative approach in all patients except pulmonary artery sling patients where a median sternotomy was the preferred approach. There were 3 early and 5 late deaths (all patients had complex cardiac anomalies) with a median follow-up of 6 years. Overall survival was 96% at 35 years. Postoperative complication occurred in 3 patients (2%) as follows: tracheostomy because of severe distal tracheal compression (n = 2) and left true vocal cord paralysis (n = 1). None of the patients showed any evidence of recurrent vascular ring anomalies at last follow-up. Of the children, 75% (135/180) were free from compressive symptoms within 1 year of the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular anomalies with/without tracheoesophageal compression present symptomatically in a variety of ways, and noninvasive methods are used to identify the specific lesion and associated cardiac defects.

Subjects were ED anaphylaxis patients with > or = 2 of the following 3 organ systems involved: cutaneous, respiratory, and cardiovascular. The major outcome criterion was recurrence of symptoms after ED release. Recurrences were sought at the primary treatment hospital and at surrounding hospitals (radius of 75 miles from the primary institution) within a 7-day period from the initial visit. Review of the state death registry also was made to verify the absence of out-of-hospital deaths. RESULTS: The medical records of 1,261 allergic reaction patients were reviewed, with 67 (5.3%) cases of anaphylaxis identified. Symptoms and signs in patients during the ED phase included: dyspnea, 42 (63%); pruritus, 38 (57%); emesis, 27 (41%); throat/chest tightness, 25 (37%); orthostatic complaints, 12 (18%); urticaria, 47 (70%); circulatory shock, 32 (48%); upper airway angioedema, 7 (33%); stridor, 11 (16%); and bronchospasm, 20 (30%).

An aortoesophageal fistula is a devastating, in part iatrogenic, complication of vascular rings. It is seen with increasing frequency, and can be misleading, since differential diagnosis with other causes of haematemesis and melaena is often difficult, especially in infants. We report two infants with aortoesophageal fistulas secondary to double aortic arches forming a vascular ring. In both, the diagnosis was missed, and massive haemorrhage led to death. In both cases, the fissuration on the oesophageal and aortic sides of the fistula had sharp edges, highly suggestive of an iatrogenic laceration caused by manipulation of nasogastric tubes. The key for the diagnosis of vascular rings is, therefore, clinical suspicion and awareness of this condition. Prompt identification in infants with stridor, wheezing, or respiratory distress can prevent prolonged intubation, thus avoiding the formation of an aortoesophageal fistula and hopefully preventing a fatal outcome.","2002","Cardiology in the young",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

Since 1989 airway evaluation with flexible or small, rigid endoscopes was used to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the appropriate management. Endoscopic findings were extremely helpful to decide not to intubate and to monitor in the pediatric intensive care unit first.

One patient remains with mild stridor at exercise; all others have no respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: A stable wide trachea can be obtained in the great majority of cases, including whole length tracheal obstructions with complete circular rings. The technique is safe and reproducible with short intensive care stay and good mid-term results.

Although benign in nature, it may cause severe airway obstruction and even death. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical manifestations of vallecular cyst in neonates and discussed its management. METHODS: From June 1993 through January 1997, 11 cases of vallecular cyst were collected and reviewed retrospectively. There were 8 male infants and 3 female infants. Their clinical manifestations, age at the onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis, and surgical management were analyzed. Fibrolaryngoscopy was used for preoperative diagnosis and postoperative follow-up. RESULTS: The infants' initial presentations were inspiratory stridor, respiratory distress, noisy breathing, feeding difficulty, and failure to thrive. There was a high incidence of patients with coexisting signs of laryngomalacia (10/11). Ten patients received laryngomicrosurgery with CO2 laser for deroofing the cyst. Additional supraglottoplasty was performed at the same time in 4 patients with laryngomalacia type A + C and in one patient with severe laryngomalacia type C. Their symptoms all resolved soon after surgery. The phenomenon of laryngomalacia also disappeared. There has been no recurrence up to the present. CONCLUSION: Although fairly uncommon, vallecular cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis of congenital laryngeal stridor in neonates. The use of fibroendoscopy can promptly diagnose vallecular cyst and any synchronous airway lesions. Although most of the synchronous laryngomalacia (type C) in this study was secondary to vallecular cyst, we suggest that supraglottoplasty be taken into consideration during cyst deroofing when the signs and symptoms of laryngomalacia type A are also present.","1999","Changgeng yi xue za zhi",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Thompson J. and Stocks R.","We describe a new variant of life-threatening organophosphate toxicity syndrome that produces a brief bilateral vocal cord paralysis. There are 3 recognized types of toxicity syndrome: acute (instantaneous), intermediate (slightly delayed, i.e., hours to days), and delayed (weeks to months). Ingestions of large doses of insecticides lead to a cholinergic crisis and possible death (acute-type syndrome). Exposures to lower doses may cause the intermediate- or delayed-type syndrome. The intermediate-type syndrome is characterized by slightly delayed polyneuropathy and generalized weakness. Transient vocal cord paralysis has also been reported in association with other neurologically profound findings. The delayed-type syndrome can produce muscle weakness for months. Our patient, a 2-year-old boy, was found eating a substance later found to be contaminated with insecticide. Within minutes, fever and somnolence developed, followed by progressive respiratory distress and stridor, without generalized weakness. The child's condition progressed to complete airway obstruction, and intubation was necessary. Emergency laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed to rule out epiglottitis or a foreign body. Instead, a bilateral vocal cord paralysis was found. The paralysis lasted 2 days before completely resolving. Insecticide poisoning was suspected. We theorize that our patient manifested a combination of the acute-type syndrome, because of the immediacy of the onset of the symptoms (i.e., fever and somnolence), and the intermediate-type syndrome, because of the transient vocal cord paralysis. Because of the potential dangers involved, we wish to familiarize physicians concerning organophosphate poisoning; to alert the medical community to this variant of toxicity syndrome, which involves transient bilateral vocal cord paralysis; and to demonstrate the benefit of early otolaryngological consultation for the prevention and treatment of airway obstruction in patients with suspected organophosphate poisoning, be it from insecticides or poison gas.","1997","Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have an increase in atherosclerotic indicators in the carotid arteries. METHODS: We studied 30 men with severe OSAS who had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of at least 20. IMT measurement and the presence of stenotic occlusive lesions in the carotid arteries (right common carotid artery [RCCA], right bulb [Rbulb], right internal carotid artery [RICA], left common carotid artery [LCCA], left bulb [Lbulb], and left internal carotid artery [LICA]) were investigated by high-resolution sonography. Results of the sonographic examinations were compared with those for a group of 20 subjects with mild OSAS (AHI <20) and 20 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The mean IMT of the carotid arteries of patients with severe OSAS was significantly higher than those of patients with mild OSAS and control subjects (RCCA 0.81 versus 0.63 versus 0.58, p <0.01; Rbulb 0.96 versus 0.87 versus 0.65, p <0.001; RICA 0.77 versus 0.69 versus 0.61, p <0.05; LCCA 0.97 versus 0.78 versus 0.67, p <0.01; Lbulb 1.01 versus 0.89 versus 0.72, p <0.01; LICA 0.91 versus 0.75 versus 0.65, p <0.001).

","Foster G. et al.","RATIONALE: The mechanism leading to increased risk of stroke in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is unknown. It may occur through alteration in the regulation of cerebral blood flow, reflected in part by the response of the cerebral vasculature to hypoxia. We hypothesized that the cerebrovascular response to hypoxia is reduced in patients with OSA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia in patients with OSA. METHODS: The cerebral blood flow response to 20 minutes of isocapnic hypoxia was measured in eight male patients with OSA before and after 4 to 6 weeks of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and in 10 matched healthy control subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia was significantly lower in patients with OSA compared with control subjects (0.56 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.97 +/- 0.09% [mean +/- SE] change in blood flow velocity per % desaturation; p=0.007). After CPAP therapy, the cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia was similar between patients with OSA and control subjects (1.08 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.13% change in blood flow velocity per % desaturation; p=0.4). Moderately strong correlations were found between the cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia and the apnea-hypopnea index (r=-0.57; p=0.04) and nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (r=0.48; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia is significantly reduced in patients with OSA. Treatment of OSA with CPAP increases the cerebral blood flow response to hypoxia to normal levels. An attenuated cerebrovascular response to hypoxia in patients with OSA may contribute to their elevated risk of stroke.","2007","American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine"," The mechanism leading to increased risk of stroke in patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is unknown ","Clinical trial",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

","Hagl S. et al.","BACKGROUND: Symptomatic obstruction of long-segment tracheal or bronchial portions either related to congenital instability or secondary to vascular compression are rare malformations, which remain difficult to manage. A method of external tracheal or bronchial stabilization is described. METHODS: From July 1992 to April 1995, 7 children (age range, 4 months to 4 years; mean age, 19 months) and 1 adult (age, 46 years) were operated on for severe respiratory insufficiency. In 4 cases of congenital tracheal instability, 2 children had associated type IIIb esophageal atresia. Both children with esophageal atresia had previous operations (two and three times, respectively): 1 child had aortopexy and division of a patent ductus arteriosus and another child had distal tracheal resection elsewhere, both without relief of malacia. All children were intubated and ventilated since birth for 11 to 15 months. Secondary tracheobronchomalacia due to vascular compression was seen in 4 patients caused by double aortic arch (n = 2) and persisting ligamentum arteriosum after previous ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus (n = 2), with 1 child ventilated thereafter for 5 months. Operation was performed with the aid of extracorporeal circulation in all patients but 1, and consisted of transection of vascular rings and persistent ligamentum Botalli (n = 5), closure of multiple ventricular septal defects (n = 1) and extensive mobilization of the tracheobronchial tree as well as the great arteries. External stabilization of the severely dysplastic distal trachea (n = 6) or left main bronchus (n = 2) was achieved by suspending the malacic segment within an oversized and longitudinally opened ring-reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis. Multiple plegeted sutures were placed extramucosally to the dysplastic tracheal wall and the dyskinetic pars membranacea, as well as to the polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis in a radial orientation. Guided by simultaneous video-assisted bronchoscopy, reexpansion of the collapsed segments was achieved by gentle traction on the sutures while tying. RESULTS: Stenosis-free tracheobronchial reexpansion was achieved in all patients, as seen on repeated bronchoscopies during hospitalization and thereafter. All patients were extubated within 1 to 12 days after the operation. There was one late death, unrelated to the procedure, in a 31-month-old child 20 months after the operation. All other patients are free of stridor and in excellent clinical condition 21 to 54 months (mean, 38 months) thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The presented method of bronchoscopically guided external tracheobronchial suspension within a ring-reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis immediately relieves severe malacia of the trachea or main bronchi in infants as well as adults without necessitating resection. Midterm preliminary data suggest that growth potential of the affected segment exists within the oversized polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis.","1997","The Annals of thoracic surgery",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

METHOD: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients admitted to our hospital between 1996 and 2001 with the diagnosis of AE. RESULTS: A total of 70 charts on which a diagnosis of AE had been entered were reviewed. Of those, 45 patients (64%) had AE that was thought to be related to ACEI therapy. Of those 45 patients, 29 were women. The mean age was 62 years, and 41 (91%) were African-American. The duration of ACEI therapy before presentation varied from 1 day to 5 years postingestion. Twenty-one of 32 patients presented within 2 months of the initiation of therapy. The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and presentation to the hospital was 9 h.

","Bové T. et al.","BACKGROUND: Tracheobronchial compression of vascular origin is an uncommon but important cause of respiratory distress in infants and children. We reviewed our surgical experience with 31 children, presenting vascular tracheobronchial compression. METHODS: Thirty-one children, with a median age of seven months, were operated on for airway and/or oesophageal compression secondary to vascular anomalies. Diagnostic findings, mainly established by bronchoscopy and angiography, revealed several pathologic disorders such as right aortic arch with aortic diverticulum in 10, double aortic arch in five, innominate artery compression in six, arteria lusoria in four, and pulmonary artery sling in one patient. Five children developed tracheobronchial compression after previous repair of a complex congenital heart disease. Clinical symptoms on admission were dominantly stridor, recurrent airway infection, dyspnea, respiratory distress and upper digestive complaints such as dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux. RESULTS: Surgical relief was successful in 30 patients. Only one child with palliated tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary artery sling died because of intractable extensive tracheobronchial stenosis. Late follow-up over three to 90 months showed a symptom-free evolution in most patients, including one reoperation for recurrent compression and one late death. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheobronchial compression by vascular structures in childhood is uncommon and may be masked by nonspecific respiratory symptoms, resulting in an often delayed diagnosis. Once imaging studies have clearly delineated the causal pathologic vascular structures, surgical correction is often straightforward and effective, in spite of the common presence of tracheobronchial malacia.","2001","The Journal of cardiovascular surgery",,"Review",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

We have used omental pedicle flap (OPF) to seal the anastomotic line and to restore the vascularity of the graft and the trachea in an attempt to avoid fatal complications. During the period between 1986 and 1990, OPF technique was used in tracheobronchial reconstruction in six patients aged 4 months to 3 years; cartilage graft for extensive tracheal stenosis (4), tracheal resection and anastomosis (1), and bronchial resection and anastomosis (1). The omentum was separated from the colon to form an OPF with the right gastroepiploic vessels preserved. The OPF was brought to the upper trachea in the mediastinum through the retrosternal space. There was no immediate postoperative death due to anastomotic leak. Endotrachial tubes were removed in all patients. Four of the six are totally free of airway problems. One patient showed persistent stridor because of remaining stenosis at the cervical trachea. The remaining one patient who underwent bronchial resection developed anastomotic stenosis probably due to the compression of the floppy left main bronchus by adjacent aorta.

Clinical records and follow-up were available in all cases. The light microscopic features (hematoxylin and eosin and special histochemical stains) were evaluated in all cases; immunohistochemical analysis was performed in the seven cases with available paraffin blocks; in four cases ultrastructural analysis was done. RESULTS: The patients included five males and three females ranging in age from 19-69 years (median, 59 years). Presenting symptoms included hoarseness, dysphonia, or rapidly progressive stridor with the duration of symptoms ranging from 10 days to 4 months. The most common site of involvement was the true vocal cord. The lesions appeared as polypoid or pedunculated masses. Histologically, the cellularity of the lesions varied, consisting of spindle-shaped to stellate cells with no consistently discernible growth pattern, in a fibromyxoid stroma that included a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. Features suggesting a malignant cellular infiltrate were not present. The spindle-shaped cells had consistent immunoreactivity with vimentin, muscle specific actin, and smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, intracytoplasmic microfilaments were identified. In seven of the patients, conservative but complete excision of the lesion was curative; these patients have been free of disease over periods ranging from 12 to 36 months. In one patient, the lesion recurred twice over a 2-year period and ultimately required a total laryngectomy. This patient died of unrelated causes. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors of the larynx are unusual benign proliferative lesions. Conservative surgical management is advocated and is curative. Recurrence is rare, but metastases disease or death attributable to these lesions is not.","1995","Cancer",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

One hundred sixty-eight esophageal resections were performed on 167 patients; 13 were total, 106 subtotal and 49 distal. Nineteen digestive transplants were pulled up to the neck to bypass the esophagus or re-establish continuity after an esophagectomy made elsewhere. Digestive continuity was restored by a long gastric transplant in 120 patients, a colon segment in 17, a jejunal loop in 35, and a short gastric transplant after limited esophago-gastrectomy in 14 patients. Thirty day mortality was 0 in the whole group. Hospital mortality was 1.2% in the resection group and 10.5% in the bypass group (p = 0.048). Nonfatal postoperative complications consisted of respiratory distress in 33 patients, recurrent nerve palsy in 10, anastomotic fistula in 10 (cervical in 8 and intrathoracic in 2) and anastomotic stenosis in 18 patients. Respiratory complications were more frequent in patients with a cancer of the thoracic esophagus (29/111) than in those operated on for a cancer located in the esophago-gastric junction (4/50) (p less than 0.01). Anastomotic stenosis occurred more frequently in the neck (17/137) than in the chest (1/49) (p less than 0.05).

Forty consecutive ICD recipients with cardiac disease and a documented history of spontaneous, life-threatening, ventricular tachyarrhythmias underwent full-night polysomnography and were followed for 2 years. In 16 of 40 patients (40%), SRBD were diagnosed (Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) > 10); in 9 of these 16 patients (56%) central sleep apneas (CSA) occurred (in 8 of these 9 patients in combination with Cheyne-Stokes respiration). Seven of the 16 patients with SRBD (44%) revealed obstructive sleep apneas (OSA). AHI was 32 +/- 15 (12-60) in patients with CSA and 32 +/- 27 (11-86) in patients with OSA. Patients with and without SRBD were comparable concerning left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA classification, cardiac disease, ICD indication, and concomitant medication. ICD registered ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 10 of 24 patients (42%) without SRBD, in 4 of 9 patients (44%) with CSA, and in 3 of 7 patients (44%) with OSA. The numbers and circadian variation of episodes registered during follow-up in patients without SRBD, with OSA or CSA were comparable (14 +/- 25, median 4 vs 15 +/- 15, median 7 vs 4 +/- 5, median 2.5). The 2-year cardiac mortality was highest in patients with CSA (4/9 (44%) vs. 0/7 patients (0%) with OSA vs 3/24 patients (12.5%) without SRBD. Thus, the prevalence of SRBD in patients with chronic heart failure and a history of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias is high (40%) and the occurrence of CSA seems to be predictive for cardiac mortality in these patients.

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate deficiencies in the diagnostical protocol, to clarify the role of airway endoscopy in acute childhood stridor, and to identify current reasons for fatalities in these diseases. MATERIAL: In the observation period between 1980-92, we found 12 patients suffering from BT and 21 from AE managed in close cooperation of the involved disciplines at the pediatric intensive care unit of the University of Cologne. RESULTS: Laryngoscopy with fiberoptic or small rigid endoscopes allowed in awake cooperative children accurate diagnose of AE, and the exclusion of supraglottic inflammation in BT without complications. Furthermore, additional endoscopic information of the degree of inflammation was helpful in the next critical decision, whether artificial airway or rigid tracheobronchoscopy was required. Nasotracheal intubation was necessary in 76% of our patients, in one child tracheostomy was performed (5%). Premature extubation necessitating reintubation occurred in 33% of the children suffering from BT. In these patients, our method of advancing a flexible endoscope for tracheoscopy through the respiration tube failed because of a low tube diameter. Another remarkable finding was the high mortality in AE (14%). Affected children were admitted in poor post-hypoxia conditions following outdoor cardiorespiratory arrest. CONCLUSION: In the analysis of the clinical course we found three decisive turning points in managing the disorder; First, the confirmation of the correct admission diagnosis; second, the decision, as to whether an artificial airway should be established; and third, the proper time of extubation. The most decisive factor in decreasing mortality seems to be timely, appropriate presentation at referral centers if AE or BT is suspected. Clinically, progressive management of childhood stridor requires close cooperation between the Pediatric, Anesthesiologic, and ENT Departments.

BAEP were elicited after applying clicks 70 dB above threshold to each ear. Means of single wave latencies as well as interpeak latencies (I-V, I-III, III-V) were delayed significantly compared to normal controls. Main prolongations were seen regarding wave latency I (p < or = 0.001) and-interpeak latency I-V (p < or = 0.001). Prolongation of interpeak latencies (mean +/- 2.5 SD) of one or two sides could be demonstrated in 12 out of 20 patients. Pontomesencephal lesions (9 patients) dominated. There was no connection with respiratory parameters. As against pathological BAEP changes correlated with the duration of the disease. In conclusion pathological BAEP indicating brainstem lesions were seen in 60% of the examined OSAS-patients. Mesencephal lesions dominated, number of lesions increased with duration of disease. Therefore pathological findings have not to be considered as cause but as a result of hypoxemia in OSAS. Pathological BAEP may reveal a higher risk for cerebrovascular stroke.

During the following 8 months we observed persistent stridor, chronic cough and (4-times) relapsing episodes of respiratory insufficiency (""nearly-sudden-infant-death-syndrome""/NSIDS) due to gastrooesophageal reflux (GER with aspiration) and severe tracheomalacia combined with tracheostenosis and bacterial infections (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).

,"8594963"," [Life-threatening postoperative angioedema following treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor]. ","Maier C.","Angio-oedema is a recognised complication of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy, occurring in 0.1% to 0.5% of patients taking captopril, enalapril, or lisinopril. This is the first report of severe angio-oedema complicating therapy with quinapril, a new, long-acting drug. CASE REPORT. A 74-year-old female had been taking quinapril (10 mg/day) and diuretics (fixed combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) for arterial hypertension for 18 months without any complication. After a fracture of the ankle, the patient received spinal anaesthesia uneventfully for an osteosynthesis. Ten days postoperatively, she noted swelling of the lips and the left half of the tongue. Following intravenous injection of antihistamines and prednisolone, these symptoms regressed. However, a relapse occurred on the 16th postoperative day with rapidly increasing oedema of the lips, face, ventral collar area, and entire tongue. Despite high-dose steroids, dyspnoea developed within 2 h. Direct laryngoscopy was impossible, and a flexible bronchoscope was used for nasotracheal intubation. At this point, the diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema was made and quinapril was withdrawn. The patient recovered, tracheal extubation was performed after 48 h, and the later course was uneventful. DISCUSSION. This is the second report of angio-oedema as a postoperative complication in a patient on long-term and previously unremarkable ACE inhibitor therapy. The first reported case occurred immediately after oral intubation and was perhaps precipitated by mechanical irritation. In this case, it is likely that postoperative deterioration of renal function due to dehydration and diuretic therapy was the precipitant, as has been reported in patients on lisinopril without surgery. Despite a significant increase in angio-oedema associated with the use of long-acting ACE-inhibitors, there appears to be a lack of familiarity among anaesthesiologist and other emergency physicians concerning this adverse effect. Withdrawal of the drug is the only effective treatment. High-dose steroids may be helpful, but if there is beginning dyspnoea or stridor, early endoscopically controlled intubation or emergency tracheostomy is essential to avoid hypoxaemia and death, as has occurred in the past.","1995","Der Anaesthesist",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"

It is characterized by easily audible inspiratory stridor caused by severe stenosis. Several causes in the pharynx and larynx may be responsible. Pharmacotherapy is hardly effective, an intubation extremely difficult in extremis. In contrast emergency coniotomy offers a real chance to reopen the airways even to the surgically inexperienced. The technique for this intervention is described.","2000","Praxis",,"other",1,"stridorIahMortality","2023-11-13"
